Thu Aug 13 2015,N/A,"Eden Prairie, MN","IT Project Manager in Eden Prairie, MN",Very heads-down,762,"I will preface this review with a statement you need to heed when reading this review as well as any reviews for this company -- ""It depends on your area."" 

This is a GIGANTIC company and YMMV depending on your group. Keep that in mind when reading.

Anyway, I've been here only 6 months, but I think I have enough of a feel for Optum to write a review.

The positives:
Great work/life balance: I never have to stay late, work on weekends, etc. I get 23 vacation days and my manager encourages me to use them AND completely unplug while away. 

Beautiful office: I work at the new Optum office in Eden Prairie. Building is modern and comfortable. Full size gym and locker room, and workout classes. Great parking ramp with a skyway so you never need to go outside in the rain or snow!

Work from home: VERY progressive with WFH! I can work from wherever I want. if I want to WFH one day, I can. If I want to WFH the whole week, I can do that, too. No one questions you.

Total autonomy

No drama: This is a very heads down place! I can't stress that enough. No one socializes with each other -- most of the time, you never even talk to your cube neighbors (because they're probably working from home). This is a positive for me though -- after working in some high drama offices, this is a refreshing change. 

All meetings are over webex: Great news if you hate in-person meetings like I do -- because there are very few! In the 6 months I've been here, I've had 4 in person meetings. This is also a con because you never meet your coworkers - read the con list for more info. 

30 minute ""best practice"" meeting times: You will not get invited to 2+ hour meetings, ever. Nearly all meetings are only 30 minutes. You might have the one-off meeting that's an hour, but it's rare. 

Good, standardized PM practices. But some of the documentation requirements are too rigid and can slow progress down. Our group is trying to move to 100% agile. Slowly.... All of my projects so far have been waterfall SDLC. Although as a new person, it would help to have a PM to shadow on some of these documentation/audit practices. I've had to learn as I go. 

- Great cafeteria with cheap prices. I can get a lunch here cheaper than I can bring it from home.

-Very engaging training classes!!! All training classes are over LearnSource (i.e. your computer) but the videos are well done and entertaining.
","-Building seems empty because so many people WFH. It's almost kind of...sad. Such a nice building but no one is there.

-Internet explorer is the browser of choice. Yuck. You have to have special permissions to download Google Chrome or Firefox on your computer.

-If you like socializing with your coworkers, this is NOT a place for you! I can't stress that enough!! You will NOT meet your new BFF here. Everyone is very heads-down and focused on work -- no one chit chats about football or True Detective! You will not have coworkers stopping by your desk (to chat about a TV show OR to even chat about work). Most of my days, I don't talk to anyone in person. It's kind of depressing -- and I'm an introvert! There are no happy hours, social events outside of work, etc (this is a positive for me because I hate that stuff).

-Lots of contractors. Not that it's a bad thing - I've had great experiences with the PM contractors. They obviously don't last as long as the employees, and there's more contractor PMs than employee PMs.

-Difficult, as a new person, to know ""who's who."" There is no face-to-face meetings, so as a PM, it's tough to know who does what, since there's no face to put with the name. I struggle with this a lot, as I'm not used to this extreme of a ""remote"" workforce! 

-No wifi for your phone. Wifi is only available for visitors and you must have a user name and password. 

-Nearly all social media websites are blocked. Not really a con, but something you might want to know. You won't be browsing facebook at work!

-LOTS of meetings. Sure, the meetings aren't in person, they're over Webex, but you will have a LOT of them.

-Some ""know-it-all"" ego-driven coworkers, especially on the tech side. But this is typical of IT in general. I've witnessed this at every org in which I've worked.

Treat your employees better. A $0.11 annual raise is insulting and ridiculous for a company that is so successful. It is also unfair to give employees bonuses and then eliminate their positions right before the holidays- with no heads up or prior notice.

","Low pay! In 2018, my annual raise was $0.11 and my coworker’s was $0.10. The health insurance offered to their employees is horrible. In all positions I held, my coworkers and I were micromanaged and our computers were closely watched- every move of the mouse and keystroke. UHG is also known to eliminate positions and lay off their employees each year before Thanksgiving. This happened the last two years I worked there and I was one of them. I had received a bonus the month before our department was eliminated due to “company outsourcing”.
Advice to Management
Treat your employees better. A $0.11 annual raise is insulting and ridiculous for a company that is so successful. It is also unfair to give employees bonuses and then eliminate their positions right before the holidays- with no heads up or prior notice.

Lewin hires entry-level staff in bulk, but sometimes doesn't have work for them. Unless you're really pushing, it may take a full year before you are 100% utilized.
The majority of senior staff is nice, but some are borderline abusive to those below them. Management does not care.

This company is being run by a bean counter who has a total disconnect from the workforce outside the executive suite.

Tue Dec 29 2020, Nurse Practitioner,"Charleston, WV",Current Employee ,UHG/ after Med Express Purchase,1,"Reasonable Pay, normally ample supplies, Well kept facilities
","Since UHG purchase have slowly and steadily reduced employee benefits. Before UHG purchase averaged 8-10 percent merit increases annually. After UHG purchase of med express average 1-1,5 % increase annually. No more than CPI. Monthly request days on schedule reduced from 7 to 5. Semi annual bonus used to average 2500-3000. After takeover less than 3k annually can be expected. Doors dont lock until 8pm (12 hour shift) and no patients turned away. If seven to ten sign in at 750 pm expect to work late an hour or more with no compensation. All providers are considered “exempt ie salary”. No overtime pay. 401k match reduced from 4 percent to 3.5. Annual CEU reimbursement reduced by 500-800 annually. Long mandatory teleconference scheduled before 8am or after 8pm with no compensation. Before UHG take over when supervisor asked for Practitioner to pick up extra shifts time and a half and often double time offered. Since UHG takeover supervisors rarely offer incentives to pick up extra. They expect you to be a “team player” and work extra shifts at straight time rate. Often clinics are short staffed of ancillary personnel ie nurses Med techs. Providers are expected to continue with their responsibilities and pick up responsibilities of short staffing ie triage patients, give injections ect. Overall, since UHG takeover, morale overall has significantly decrease due to above mentioned. Supervisors inform employees how well the Company overall and stock price is doing while at the same time UHG has taken away compensation and other employee incentives. UHG is a very large company with over 300k employees. Its very evident employees are not valued and you are nothing but another number that can be replaced. Nothing like Med Express used to be when owned by Mr Alderman who treated and rewarded all his employees like they were family.
Advice to Management
Consider returning compensation and perks you have taken away and realize its the individual providers that are responsible for “how well your stock is doing”. Reward and show sincere appreciation for those whom are driving your corporate profits. Its corporate greed that is driving the socialist movement in America today. This same fact is the reason why there will be a new administration in Washington in 2021. When large corporations received significant tax reductions after 2016 election they have proven that trickle down economics dont work. Corporations appreciate the reduced tax obligation but fail to share A fair part of this increased wealth with the employees whom are doing the work. Think about rewarding those in the trenches whom are generating your revenue rather than being more concerned about rewarding your stock holders.

Tue Dec 29 2020, Nurse Practitioner,"Charleston, WV",Current Employee ,UHG/ after Med Express Purchase,1,"Reasonable Pay, normally ample supplies, Well kept facilities
","Since UHG purchase have slowly and steadily reduced employee benefits. Before UHG purchase averaged 8-10 percent merit increases annually. After UHG purchase of med express average 1-1,5 % increase annually. No more than CPI. Monthly request days on schedule reduced from 7 to 5. Semi annual bonus used to average 2500-3000. After takeover less than 3k annually can be expected. Doors dont lock until 8pm (12 hour shift) and no patients turned away. If seven to ten sign in at 750 pm expect to work late an hour or more with no compensation. All providers are considered “exempt ie salary”. No overtime pay. 401k match reduced from 4 percent to 3.5. Annual CEU reimbursement reduced by 500-800 annually. Long mandatory teleconference scheduled before 8am or after 8pm with no compensation. Before UHG take over when supervisor asked for Practitioner to pick up extra shifts time and a half and often double time offered. Since UHG takeover supervisors rarely offer incentives to pick up extra. They expect you to be a “team player” and work extra shifts at straight time rate. Often clinics are short staffed of ancillary personnel ie nurses Med techs. Providers are expected to continue with their responsibilities and pick up responsibilities of short staffing ie triage patients, give injections ect. Overall, since UHG takeover, morale overall has significantly decrease due to above mentioned. Supervisors inform employees how well the Company overall and stock price is doing while at the same time UHG has taken away compensation and other employee incentives. UHG is a very large company with over 300k employees. Its very evident employees are not valued and you are nothing but another number that can be replaced. Nothing like Med Express used to be when owned by Mr Alderman who treated and rewarded all his employees like they were family.
Advice to Management
Consider returning compensation and perks you have taken away and realize its the individual providers that are responsible for “how well your stock is doing”. Reward and show sincere appreciation for those whom are driving your corporate profits. Its corporate greed that is driving the socialist movement in America today. This same fact is the reason why there will be a new administration in Washington in 2021. When large corporations received significant tax reductions after 2016 election they have proven that trickle down economics dont work. Corporations appreciate the reduced tax obligation but fail to share A fair part of this increased wealth with the employees whom are doing the work. Think about rewarding those in the trenches whom are generating your revenue rather than being more concerned about rewarding your stock holders.

","Raises are almost non-existent. Management is expected to deliver raises sometimes at the level or 2cents in additional pay per hour to front line employees. That is sad considering the amount of money UHG generates. 

ALL people are not valued. As I was in management, I have witnessed multiple times when people were ""targeted"" for use of PTO or FMLA/Short term disability. Yes, there are some FMLA/STD abusers, but not all. 

Long work hours for management is expected, even if not needed. They attempt to squeeze as much out, at least on the OptumRx side of the business. If in management, learn to set boundaries, but also realize there will be consequences. 

Little HR support for management. They will not back or support you.

Advocates are expected to change their hours on a permanent basis with as little as 48 hours. Not even a reasonable expectation, but it's there. 

Workforce management is awful to work with. I would not want there job. They are not provided the resources or appropriate tools.

There is no advice. The OptumRx side of the business is a shambles from the top down . The upper to senior management is rife with favoritism, and side deals. It's very sad. The overall customer service department is a grim work environment. Best of luck to those that continue to work there. I know people need jobs, even if they are bad.

I would suggest listening to employees so that they feel heard and changes made would involve feedback from both members and employees. I would also suggest ensuring all nurseline staff is aware and trained on nurseline processes before it’s rolled out. It is very difficult to help a member without having a clue on what they’re talking about. Be more approachable with staff so when an issue arise they feel supported instead of feeling like a bother.

For a company whose core value is to empathize and help their members, it clearly doesn’t reflect in their treatment of employees. All that matters is the metrics. Stop micro-managing your employees to such a stressful degree. It is no surprise the turnaround is sky high. Expecting the best but giving employees little time to prepare is not how you achieve the best results. At UHG you’re not even a fish in a small pond. You’re a micro organism in a vast sea. Not to mention the amount of favoritism that occurs. SST is worthless since you often have to wait 20-30, and even longer, for a rep to answer while your member is on hold.

You need to raise the minimum wages across the board. Compensation is not sufficient for the work being done when the company is raking in billions of dollars in profit. The lowest level employees are completing some of the toughest and most challenging job duties (customer service, claim processing, appeals and complaints) yet they are treated as metrics that are easily replaceable.

","Going through TAU is good after training. BUT when you are still in TAU for a while due to adherence issues (once again issues with the systems that help adjust my breaks and lunches). My call quality is beyond amazing but due to the systems that are given to us my adherence is not up to par to the companies standards. Since you are not out of TAU after a couple of months you begin to see that they are trying to find everything and anything to attempt to get you termed. Once again horrendous company to work for if you are amazing at your customer service. My adherence is not even close to my fault it is due to the systems not working to par to your demands.
Advice to Management
I would love to obtain someone who is above my department so that I can report their consistent harassment of my adherence due to system issues. My team lead is also aware of my adherence problems, due to the program not updating my schedule, but are not willing to help fix the issues.

Advice to Management
Care about your employees more. We do so much work, but it seems we aren't rewarded for it. Watching the company go through massive reductions in force over the course of a couple years sucks especially when you see that the CEOs pay went up 142% YOY. Quit laying people off to show better earnings to make the stock go up. Give people raises. We are doing more work now than we were 2 years ago because of the reductions in force, but we have nothing to show for it. 2% increases across the board doesn't even keep up with inflation. There is no reason the CEO should be making 650-1 Ratio pay compared to the rest of the employees.

Approves of CEO
I have been working at UnitedHealth Group full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
-Depending on which part of the business, the coworkers can be pleasant
-WFH policy is generally very open, but depends on the manager attitude
-Salary is good, but like mentioned in other reviews, gets easily outpaced by the market
-Generally, everyone makes an effort to listen to issues brought up by employees
-PTO offering
-If you land on a good team with directors that can manage their leaders well, it makes a whole world of positive difference
Cons
-Disregard for process, lots of ""urgent"" requests that result in rushed work that is difficult to take pride in accomplishing
-Uninspired leadership lacks diversity of perspective, very self-congratulatory leader culture filled with people that don't actually know how to do anything but meet with each other and present what they met about to their teams
-If you tell leaders ""No"" in any way, be prepared to search for a new job
-Don't expect support from anyone; employees are left to figure everything out on their own
-Lack of clarity on all work projects, particularly when requests come in directly from leadership
-Benefit offerings are not great, considering this is a health insurance company. 
-Work/life balance is extremely up and down. You'll be told often they don't want you working nights and weekends, and then they will expect work be done on nights and weekends. And while on PTO.
-LOTS of meetings where nothing gets accomplished other than scheduling another meeting
-They've spent years talking about increasing career development opportunities, and there has been very little improvement for all the talk. If you want to pursue a track in leadership, you will need to move to another company - UnitedHealth appears focused on hiring leaders from outside industries
-Regular major administrative restructuring leads to yearly layoffs, job security is not a sure thing. And company culture only gets worse with every shake up. 
-Political bias is now RAMPANT in all areas. You will get treated differently if you reveal too much about your personal life and opinions.
-Reviews, raises and bonuses appear arbitrary and not tied, in reality, to performance

I have been working at UnitedHealth Group full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
-Depending on which part of the business, the coworkers can be pleasant
-WFH policy is generally very open, but depends on the manager attitude
-Salary is good, but like mentioned in other reviews, gets easily outpaced by the market
-Generally, everyone makes an effort to listen to issues brought up by employees
-PTO offering
-If you land on a good team with directors that can manage their leaders well, it makes a whole world of positive difference
Cons
-Disregard for process, lots of ""urgent"" requests that result in rushed work that is difficult to take pride in accomplishing
-Uninspired leadership lacks diversity of perspective, very self-congratulatory leader culture filled with people that don't actually know how to do anything but meet with each other and present what they met about to their teams
-If you tell leaders ""No"" in any way, be prepared to search for a new job
-Don't expect support from anyone; employees are left to figure everything out on their own
-Lack of clarity on all work projects, particularly when requests come in directly from leadership
-Benefit offerings are not great, considering this is a health insurance company. 
-Work/life balance is extremely up and down. You'll be told often they don't want you working nights and weekends, and then they will expect work be done on nights and weekends. And while on PTO.
-LOTS of meetings where nothing gets accomplished other than scheduling another meeting
-They've spent years talking about increasing career development opportunities, and there has been very little improvement for all the talk. If you want to pursue a track in leadership, you will need to move to another company - UnitedHealth appears focused on hiring leaders from outside industries
-Regular major administrative restructuring leads to yearly layoffs, job security is not a sure thing. And company culture only gets worse with every shake up. 
-Political bias is now RAMPANT in all areas. You will get treated differently if you reveal too much about your personal life and opinions.
-Reviews, raises and bonuses appear arbitrary and not tied, in reality, to performance
