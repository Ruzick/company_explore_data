It's fun job overall. My store has higher than average foot traffic and the area is well to do so that has helped my learn fast and make great sales right out the gate.
","The job is providing a free design service to people who don't know what to expect out of the project. They want their meetings now, designs ready to sell tomorrow, cabinets arrived next week and installed yesterday. Part of the job is painting the bigger picture and creating realistic expectations. You get treated like a retail employee by many not all. If the customer opts to have their own cabinet installers then it is an uphill battle because let me tell you most contractors out there have no idea what they are doing it how to install cabinets. When that happens they blame you. Then guess what you have to ask them for more money for the new cabinets to fix it. This makes them more angry. It takes a long time to get really good at the job to avoid these problems. Lastly the position takes such specific training and knowledge that it isn't likely to move up in the company.
Advice to Management
The position has the highest turn over rate in all of Home Depot. Make sure the COS is doing their part and you have enough designs to share the load.

Advice to Management
Stop treating Night Freight like we're cleanup for daytime if you're expecting us to not leave any freight behind. We have our own job to do, and usually not enough people to do it. Extra work always takes time to do, and while it seems like we have the entire night to do this one tiny thing that you want, it's actually not tiny, and usually takes a couple of associates hours of their time, in which they can't do their normal job. On nights with no truck, sometimes this is fine, but it's a hard job anyways, and we usually look forward to nights with no truck. Don't lower morale by having us do extra work that day team should be doing instead. Or come in some nights yourself to help out and see how difficult our job actually is, rather than complaining that we don't get everything done perfectly every night.

With a large company it is difficult to micromanage every store, but there are many things that can be fixed for the better.

Oftentimes appreciation in this company is blatantly dull and without meaning, associates get lukewarm pizza while salaried ASM's and store managers receive extra money when it comes time for the midyear bonus. 

After working at The Home Depot for over two years I have come to find the associates at my store as a second family, and I have made friendships that will likely be lifelong, But I feel like the companies values are straying more towards ""Creating shareholder value"" than ""Taking care of our people"".

I think I get why you need to implement the stricter changes on time management, but those changes have effectively made me work less. Before the emphasis on upholding the bay service time estimates, I would work hard to down stock, look for stock in other aisles, and organize each bay as much as I could. My hard-working coworkers (not all were hard-working) agree with me on this. It simply wasn't worth wasting even a few minutes searching for a ladder or an electric Ballymore to down stock when I had only 12 minutes to clean up a mess of a bay. And if it is fine for us to not down stock, let us know. When a coworker of mine asked for advice on how exactly we are to do bay service, asking what specifically was important, management wouldn't give her a straight answer. There was probably a good reason for it, but as a worker the lack of transparency of how exactly they want us to do our job was frustrating to deal with.

Advice to Management
Stay consistent after promoting an associate. To many cooks in the kitchen is a great way to describe the management. Each department has a direct management but if one gives you a task the other feels is not a priority than the original task does not get done you get in trouble for not completing. No real communication.

Mon Jan 11 2021, Sales Associate,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,Average,0,"It does not seem to be too difficult to get a Full Time position, just show up on time and try to be productive. You can get benefits of course. If you just want a few hours a week as a part time associate they will work with you too as long as you have open availability on one weekend day. They do give a decent amount of online training so you are able to learn about other departments/products. If you are able to work overnights/don't enjoy dealing with customers Home Depot has an overnight crew(some weekends required). You start to learn about tools(if you don't come with that background) that may help you in day to day activities. Sales in the last year I guess were good company wide.
","1. If you give great effort every day and try to get things done you get paid about the same as someone who doesn't really try and workers who continually use ""I didn't know that"" as an excuse. Lesson: Do the minimum required. Now, to be fair, if you want to move up to Supervisor and maybe even Assistant Manager you will want to give a lot of effort so they see you actually care.
2. Not really any benefit to becoming a Supervisor. They throw you into a new department with no on the job training and the pay supposedly is not that great. If no one volunteers to do inventory you are required to work 2 weeks of overnights doing inventory.
3. This company talks a good game about safety but there are people using forklifts who have been given a minimum amount of training. 
4. Management does not use the same standard when dealing with employees. Some are fired, some stick around and contribute next to nothing. Who knows why.
5. Your supervisor will be in the department with you but they may be new to Home Depot and may not have any retail experience or know much about the products they are selling.
6. Watch out for fellow employees. Home depot seems to hire just about anyone, do not leave anything valuable lying around or even in your locker.
7. A decent amount of theft by ""customers"". Don't try to stop it or you will be fired on the spot, Home depot corporate only puts Loss Prevention people in certain stores.

","Hard floors (make sure to get gel inserts or you will regret it), inconsistent scheduling (some days really early, other days really late, made sleep schedule near impossible to maintain), not flexible weekend hours (weekend store, so you will have little time to do homework on weekends if you are a student)
Advice to Management
When you are a full-time student, getting consistent sleep is a must. Please allow associates to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, because this is crucial for productivity, happiness, and general health and wellbeing. If you work some days at 6 am and others until 10 pm, you cannot consistently get eight hours of sleep each night unless you go to bed and wake up at different times on different days. This is not how your internal clock is meant to operate and makes it very difficult to get proper sleep.

Not to mention, the office looks like crap and is so outdated. I can’t believe for such a large company they don’t even have decent office accommodations for employees.

Fri Jan 01 2021, Asset Protection Specialist,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,A Thankless and Meaning less position,0,"You are the first to see new home improvement merchandise.
","Asset protection on the whole is not a terrible position. The reason this position is terrible with The Home Depot is because they took the same stance as most of the PC world on dealing with criminals. ""Let them do what they are going to do and deal with it on the back end."" Personally, I would watch as one group of shoplifters would hit every store in Houston for a minimum of 2,000 dollars per visit. They were eventually caught two years after they started but all of that merchandise was never recovered and the impact these people had on the associates was never recovered.
Also unlike all other positions with Home Depot Asset protection has no clear upward trajectory.
Advice to Management
Actually partner with law enforcement. Do not raise your prices on honest customers due to the bad. That is a slippery slope.

I worked my way up from pushing carts to becoming a supervisor. Home depot offers great benefits, a flexible schedule, and a wonderful workplace environment
","My biggest con to working at home depot would have to be the hourly pay. There are multiple associates that break their backs constantly and pursue higher levels in the company only to get more responsibilities with the same pay while hiring new associates at higher rates. On multiple occasions I have had individuals leave due to low pay or no promotional opportunities.
Advice to Management
As someone who had worked their way all the way up, it took me 4/5 years and I still was getting paid around 12 n hour. I understand the in and outs but if you are going to raise your base rate, raise the employees that have been working as well. Multiple times in my duration I had an ""promotion"" only to find that they hired a lot associate for my same pay grade.
