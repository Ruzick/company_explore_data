Be loyal to your leaders, especially knowing the company executives aren’t.

Imagine spending that on more permanent associates, per shift. (Thus offering work/life balance) I spent 20 years with the company. They just didn’t get it. They put $ in bringing in “experts” to figure these things out...all for not. Or they realign and cut jobs, just in time for financials to be reported out. I learned a lot in my 20 years. A lot of what NOT to do, in order to be successful in business. Using this knowledge has grown my career to new heights. (With a work/life balance!)

","Too many hours due to lack of employee's, management doesn't heed the advice of those actually doing the job or is extremely slow to make appropriate and easy changes.

Pay is below standard for industry and job duties. Putting driver facing camera's in all trucks as a babysitting tool. They say they are not going to be used as a disciplinary tool but the only reason there would need to be a driver facing camera is for the recording to be used as a disciplinary tool through coaching or write ups. either way it is a distraction to the driver and adds stress to the job.

Tue Oct 16 2018, Maintenance A,"Enderlin, ND",Former Employee ,Maintenance A since 1994,0,"pension is ok below average in the industry but at least one is offered.
","this company gives less than cost of living pay increases, and increases the employee contribution to the benefit package thus driving down your standard of living. The heath care package is poor 1million life time cap and if your heathy you will pay all of your heath care costs and typically not meet your deductible. This is by design. The management has 0 accountability , their slogan for safety is zero is possible. but should be zero is probable as anything that may occur will be blamed on the effected employee 100% of the time regardless of any circumstance. This is also by design and the reason for their belief in zero is possible , zero liability as their goal. I believe their primary concern is not the safety of the employees as much as it is to cover their liability in any situation regardless of anything else. I worked for ADM for 23 years as a maintenance A my job was to help maintain the electrical maintenance troubleshoot electrical problems and support of primarily electrical based problems in the plant. I received my Journeymans and Master electricians license while I worked there. but this company does not have electricians on staff thus my maintenance A job description. They do this so the can pay the employees less than electrician standard wages and still have them do electrical work. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I finally got fed up and left it was not hard to find a company to top what this one offered.

Hopefully you will work for one of them. Hopefully you will work in one of the business units that really values its people and not corporate. There are definitely those who try to make ADM a great place to have a meaningful career for people just starting at entry level positions as well as those who join ADM already with some experience.
","Unfortunately, there are managers who are knowledge experts but haven’t a clue how to properly manage teams. These people should not under any circumstance have direct reports. Upper management values stability more than actually putting a great leader in place. Management is not rewarded for developing a great team so development is not a focus. “Perception is the only thing that matters.” Direct quote from a very senior person. It doesn’t matter if in reality you are destroying value or hurting the team if simply the perception is the opposite. The route to success here is to convince the person above you that you know what you’re talking about. It doesn’t matter whether that’s actually true or not. An MBA from a top school can buy instant credibility and opportunities not afforded to those without regardless of performance.

","Everyone is promoted on an arbitrary basis.

Good, productive engineers are left behind because they don't work the hours, while less than capable engineers get moved up because they are at work before their managers get to work and after their managers leave. The review system is unproductive because it is based on the amount of work done not the quality of work or the employee's ability to work with team members. There is no structured system for Engineers to move up in pay scale. There is no definition for Production Engineer, Engineer I, Engineer II, Engineer III, and Senior Engineer and these titles are arbitrarily distributed. You won't get the title unless you request it.

Advice to Management
Management's ability to retain talent is less than stellar. Of the 20 engineers that I started with 9 years ago 1 remains with the company. That is not an exaggeration. Management needs to stop asking 'why do we lose engineers' and start putting in the initiative and research to actually understand why.

Mon Apr 25 2016,Anonymous,"Decatur, IL",Current Employee ,CFO Group,1,"Note: This review is only relevant for positions within the CFO Group (Finance, accounting, internal audit & IT). ADM is a stable company and one of the top ag companies in the world. In finance and accounting, the work/life balance is manageable, and most departments are laid back. There are summer hours, and a few employee appreciation events throughout the year. In addition, the company is very stable- while the industry doesn’t have much of an upside, it has even less of a downside; everyone needs food. The commercial group (not part of CFO group) is considered amongst the best in the world for grain merchandising.
","The ag-industry is slow growing, has tiny margins, and doesn’t really change, hence ADM lacks a dynamic atmosphere, and more resembles an inefficient government bureaucracy. When you also consider that most CFO-group jobs are in Decatur, Il (a polluted, rundown industrial town), this leads to several negative factors:

-Minimal career development. They don’t develop their own employees, so most senior-level employees are recruited from competitors who DO develop employees.

-Low pay. Only top managers are eligible for any form of bonus. Salary is known to be far below industry standard.

-Ancient IT systems, think 1980’s DOS system. Seriously. ADM isn’t Apple.

-Brain-drain/less qualified employees. No qualified person really wants to live in Decatur. The 'leftovers' are more focused their multiple out of wedlock children and the Kardashians. 

-Nepotism. It’s amazing how many people have a relative that were ‘helped.’ Many many people have the same last names, and not by coincidence.

 Simply put, the CFO group is not for intelligent, hardworking and career-minded individuals. To further attest to ADM’s status, there have been several recent high profile departures, including the head of IT, while in the middle of a huge IT transformation project. The C-suite routinely brags about its high-margin acquisition strategy, but no tiny bolt-on purchase will really ad that much value when compared to ADM’s behemoth corn/oilseeds/grain divisions.
The CFO group at ADM is a place to go for a job, for a paycheck. If you are ambitious, or want at least moderate career development, AVOID any finance/accounting job at ADM. If you are interested in a merchandising role, then ADM is definitely the right place.

While it is hard to change the company given the low-margin, slow growth industry, at least focus on employee development for those employees that want to make a difference.

There is regular overtime pay.
","It's a very rough schedule to live on. Swing shifts of 12 hours, switching from day shift to night shift every 2 weeks. The days off you do have are often determined to be on call and possible overtime shifts, but without compensation. So although you will technically have days off, you would not be able to leave town or make definitive plans in town. If you get called in and exceed 40 hours for the week, you would get overtime pay, but no pay for making yourself available even when not needed. This schedule makes it difficult to have relationships outside of work. 
It is a rough place to work, both environment and people. Officially harassment of any kind is not tolerated, but truly, you need to have very thick skin to be able to be there.
Being the best you can be at your job isn't necessarily what the supervisors appreciate. Working hard, safely, maintaining a clean area, and being ahead of the rest of the pack when it comes to data reporting is not respected and some of (not all) the supervisors will trash talk good workers in front of other employees. This builds a lot of resentment and leads to a high turnover in employees.

","Management usually consists of inexperienced employees who need advancement and do not wish to leave the company. If they don't take management training seriously, things can spiral out of control quickly.

","Finance/accounting is completely separate from the commercial side at ADM, and is therefore viewed simply as a cost, and not a strategic partner. In addition, the vast majority of these positions are in Decatur, Il- if you know ANYTHING about Decatur, then that should say enough. Hence, there is minimal in career development, and a 'just here for the paycheck' mentality. If you are career-oriented and motivated, finance/accounting in ADM is not for you. If your lifestyle is more of a soccer-mom, and you don't really care that much, then it might be perfect.

I worked at Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) for more than 5 years
Pros
You can learn every area and classification you will need anywhere here in all fields. As an Electrician, (Construction & Maintenance), I have worked in non explosive, highly explosive & very corrosive areas throughout the plant. ADM is a very Safety Oriented Company that strives to continuously improve and educate all employees Contractors included.This is by a high standard of accountability to the company and for ones self by taking the time for employees to become aware of hazards in the areas they are working in. All of this is to ensure everyone goes home safely at the end of the day to their families and loved ones. They are also doing an amazing job with all the new construction over the years to make working conditions cleaner & safer for everyone whether an employee, visitor or a client. House Keeping is at the top of the list as well. Every job I have ever worked at since working at ADM I can say without hesitation I carried & carry all I have learned from ADM to all of them and all past employers and present are grateful to you. I would like to personally Thank Ron Wilson for making me do nothing but put parts away for my first 3 weeks, and telling me that in life the one thing No One can ever take from you is knowledge and knowledge becomes Wisdom only when you use it so remain teachable. Also that one learns even more when he is willing to teach others. Thanks ADM for all you taught me!!!!
Cons
Cons there are not to many except for your belief in Zero accidents. I believe 98 maybe 99% of all accidents can be prevented and that most are human error. Unfortunately things do break and what can happen will happen. I have seen people targeted after an incident that wasn't even a lost time accident and fired just afterwards for something not related supposedly. It has the reputation now so people are afraid to report anything because they know what will come next. I have never had to sign a paper anywhere that I have ever worked that stated I could not hold them liable if an accident occurred and if I did not sign it I would not be hired. Though I know the ADM is 100 % safer than when I first worked there that does not give me confidence that this is a safe place to work at. I think accountability by deniability shows a lack of integrity. Myself I personally think that anyone who deals with workmans comp is in for a world of hurt for they care nothing for the victim whether one seeks legal action or not. If one does seek legal action beware because it will follow that individual. If one is careful and follows your instructions to the T and are self-disciplined to consciously be aware of where they are, identifying thoroughly on safety sheets all existing hazards in that area & appropriate course of action to removing hazards or appropriate PPE while focused to job at hand, their odds of going home without incident is a strong 99%. Safety is a team effort so strive for perfection but be realistic that 1 to 2 % cannot be prevented. I am sorry but the smell isn't all that pleasant but I did get use to it.

","Swing shift is awful. Weekly rotation from 1st to 2nd to 3rd. You tell yourself ""yeah, I can deal with it,"" but it consumes your life after awhile. The overtime pay is great, but because of constant call-offs and understaffing, you're slammed with overtime and held over often.

Sat May 16 2015,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Analyst,1,"ADM provides free iced tea and popcorn everyday. They have a great omelete bar about once a week, and the salad bar is pretty good.
","ADM uses very old practices and has an older management mentality. It is very hierarchical. An outsider would also be surprised as some of the basic policies that this MNC does not have. The salaries are not as high as they should be across the board. I feel that they take advantage of local people from the central Illinois area in providing these lower salaries. In addition, it is troubling to see the company move its headquarters to Chicago from Decatur. I understand to an extent the business reasons for doing this, but I am concerned that this will severely damage an already fragile economy. Decatur was the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article describing the serious challenges. It just feels like ADM is leaving its roots and sacrificing the people of Decatur in the process.
Advice to Management
Consider easing up on the intense hierarchy and look at new ideas and options. Just because you have not done it before does not mean that it would not benefit the company and its employees in the long run. Also, take a more sincere approach to environmental protection. Everyone has to complete a training on environmental stewardship, but I think this is only because it was mandated by the government due to the company's many environmental violations. ADM has a big role to play in these issues and should understand the consequences of failing to protect our natural resources. In this way, the company is short-sighted.

","Swing shift was not easy with a family. Worked seven days of seconds, off 24 hours, work seven nights of thirds, off for 48 hours, work seven days of first shift, then you get four days out. It's not too bad when you get adjusted to it, but for me having a wife and kid, it has sucked. Management doesn't want to listen to you when you tell them that there's a problem, but when that problem gets out of hand and stops production it's the employee's fault. Safety only matters if it won't cost anything to do. If there's a problem with the tracks, and you tell your supervisor, he tells you he'll pass it up the line but keep using that track. When you keep using the track and cars derail, it's your fault because your supervisor never passed it up to management. Communication is non existent. When the superintendent comes out of his office, he doesn't know what anything is or where anything is. He will also yell at you for doing something wrong, when he doesn't know if it's wrong or right in the first place. If you take your concerns higher than him, that he doesn't know what is going on, they tell you not to worry about it. It's a very discouraging system.

Mon Oct 20 2014, Merchandiser,,Current Employee ,Good Place To Start Your Grain Trading Career,1,"- Very hands on work, learn as you go
- Access to market movers. ""Why did soybeans go up 10 today or why did the spread firm 3?"" Answer: ""Because we did X and Y"".
- Plenty of experienced people to help answer questions and lead the way
- Plenty of opportunities to move around the country and world, see new places, meet new people
-Benefits such has health and 401k matching are great, probably some of the best around
- ADM is very respected in the agribusiness world, always gets good remarks from the competition and customers
-Moving packages are generous, covers the cost of moving and then some
-Starting salary as a merchandiser can be bleh, but if you do well, several raises will come your way over the next couple of years.
","Really, only cons are salary, hours, and technology. Salary is OK, one can definitely be comfortable with what is earned, but still lags behind the industry standard. You could argue though that this lower salary is traded for job security. Other firms if you don't do well, you get canned. Here, you would stay on and get several chances before being fired.

The other con is hours, and I mean the sense that if it's dead in the office, you're still expected to stick around. With technology today, much of your job can be done outside of the office. However, it seems there's still the attitude that if you're not in the office, you're not working.

Finally, technology. The systems we use to track contracts, contacts, A/R, everything is decades old. And I mean decades. Information is not easy to access. Even the simplest things like looking up a contract balance can be a daunting task if you don't have the right permissions or know what commands to type. However, this is a known problem in the company, and millions of dollars are being spent to get us updated. By the time this gets rolled out though, the tech will likely be outdated. I won't hold my breathe.

Even entry level laborers earn a respectable wage. Good group of coworkers and floor level supervisors. Not always necessary to ""run your butt off"" to keep up with workload. Good 401k investment options.
","Upper level management has literally no regard or respect for the workers, and is shameless in demonstrating their disdain. Sounds extreme, but it truly borders on sociopathic. Workers cafeteria has elementary school style and size lunch tables. When complaints were lodged, response from plant superintendent was that they didn't want you in there for long, so they're not going to make it comfortable. Management cafe is another story, however. Reward for hitting a safety goal in most places may be a sweatshirt or coffee mug... we once got a candy cane and a packet of hot cocoa mix, because it was near the holidays. Employee drops unconscious in the entry hallway, is forced to leave via ambulance...and then is charged a day on his attendance record for leaving. Working environment is 120°F or more in much of the plant. Work schedule is impossible to live your life around. Full production scheduled on major holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas, all while equipment sat idle for weeks prior. And unless you have an engineering degree (brains optional), don't even bother suggesting an improvement to the process. If it ever gets implemented at all, it will only be months or years after your suggestion, and after an engineer has reintroduced the idea as his own and taken credit for it.

Your ROIC will skyrocket.

Create local challenges for each plant; similiar to the billion dollar challenge - you'll be suprised at the feedback you'll recieve from first hand plant workers. Their information would solve major plant issues.

Don't skimp on raises- instead of giving a 5.6% or 2.7% raise, give your employee 6% or 3% raise. You're trying to keep talent, not push it away...

","1. High level dirty politics; no element of confidence or camaraderie in leadership. Everyone is planning a coup for another and mid management is the pawn for these dirty tactics.
2. Typical conservative environment. No freedom to voice an opinion. Forget about voicing, you are not even entitled to have an opinion.
3. Extremely serious and tensed floor, you are not allowed to talk to your colleagues or grab a coffee with your colleagues perhaps they want to have a policy restricting the number of times you get up from your workstation.
4. No place to have lunch, you can opt to sit on the stairs and have lunch or wherever, they don’t care!
5. If you miss to punch in the entry time, your salary will be deducted.
6. Hell or high water, you have to complete 9 hours and above in office.
7. You will be judged for everything you say, you wear or you think and that will have repercussions.
8. Salary structure is tweaked in a way, you would get peanuts in hands.
9. Don’t be fooled by the global image of the brand, In India it is only a Kirana Dukan (merchant store) no culture of MNC.
10. Make a wise decision, don’t take that offer.

","Below average pay (pay level ok compared to a small family owned local business, not to the international organizations in the area). 
Being treated as disposable material. Many examples of people being forced to other locations, or face resignation. Middle management is mainly occupied with pleasing their bosses, and have little regard for the wellbeing of the people on the floor. HR is purely a hiring/firing machine, don´t expect any support when in conflict with a manager or in search for a training budget. Still an American passport is your ticket to success, and don´t expect any flexibility if your family situation would (temp.) require that.

- excellent experience with plenty of training for learning financial audit 
- Rolle, Switzerland, is located in a lovely place and you can do jogging during lunch time
- good performance appraisal
- good environment in Switzerland (until will last)
","- The main issue is that HR Resource Planning is unpredictable, to say the least. It's hard to plan your life (e.g. family, kids) with a company that does not tell you clearly if they have plans to relocate (in cheaper countries) in the next 2 years. They relocated and hired hundreds of people in Switzerland between 2008 and 2010 and since 2012 they have started making redundancies.
- routinary activities with hundreds of spreadsheets can become boring after a while 
- do not trust when they say that you are a talent and they want to retain you. It's just a slogan

Thu Nov 08 2012, Operations Manager,,Former Employee ,Unstable company,0,"There were many wonderful, hard working folks I met while working at ADM. By now, most have moved on to better opportunities at other companies or have been affected by the RIF in February 2012. ADM was known for its dedication to employees, but as the Andreas family has moved on, the dedication to employees has disappeared. In the past, professionals would start and retire their careers at ADM due to the stability and family-like environment; therefore, employees were proud to work at ADM. I hope for the greater good and sake of the company that the stability and commitment to hard working employees will return soon.

With good internal connections, there is ability to move cross-departmentally and change careers.
","Unfair compensation (especially for women), poor work-life balance, long hours for exempt employees, no development plans for the majority (a select few are chosen for management development programs but there is no set plan and much uncertainty so trainees leave before or shortly after completing the program), no promotion track, subjective ratings/reviews (even if a professional completes all goals and has gone above expectations, the employee is rated as ""meets"" at the most), very low culture or diversity, located in the middle of nowhere, high turnover, corrupt acts created mandatory trainings and tests for all employees - which takes much time out of one's work day, too many initiatives that are not related to the job are enforced (much of the working day is spent on initiatives and after hours may be spent on catching up on the day work), unbalance of workload (there are many folks who cruise and waste time while other hard working professionals pick up the slack, especially middle management - who are known as ""working managers"" – has to do their direct report's work and their own work), reported harassment and discrimination cases may be reviewed but are rarely in the favor of the plaintiff and result in an unjust conclusion (many times the employee that was harassed or discriminated against was later demoted, asked to seek external opportunities, or nothing was done to resolve the issue), sr. management continues to shift from their ever changing plans, very unstable with no clear direction or focus, always cost cutting and then spending money where there are no returns, the service groups are treated poorly compared to commercial or profit centers, stock price continues to slip even with sr. management's initiatives (RIF, cost cutting contests, etc...), and downsizing continues to happen today.

Innovation, passion, competence, productivity and business enhancing results are not valued and actually appear to be punished.

Tue Aug 10 2010,N/A,,Accounting Supervisor ,A good place to work,0,"Because it is a Fortune 50 company planted (pun intended) in the middle of the prairie, ADM has to pay special attention to employee satisfaction in order to attract and retain top talent. If you don't mind living a bit removed from a major metropolitan center, ADM will pay you a very competitive salary in a relatively low cost-of-living area. The corporate culture prizes honesty, transparency and hard work.

Basically, if you come in trading right out of college, its pretty difficult to transition into a different part of the company.
