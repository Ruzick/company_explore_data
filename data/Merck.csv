","Chemistry management simply does not care about discovering drugs. They treat the department like an academic institution by emphasizing visibility, publications, and external presentations above all else. 

First line management (Directors) are more or less ineffective. They have too many direct reports, and their seldom interaction with them leads to them being out of touch and disconnected from the lab workers. This further leads to year-end reviews that honestly look like they're just guessing.

Promotions are inscrutable. Management refuses to provide any clarity to the process. Playing games and politicking helps, but your work certainly doesn't.

","Promotions to exec levels are not necessarily based on accomplishments on priority projects and/or on top yearly reviews. Management picks certain employees to lead initiatives as a path to exec promotion. Employees who want to advance to executive levels need to work with their management to be assigned to initiatives early on to have an eventual shot at at an exec level promotion. If management does not offer such opportunities after a significant period of time (despite very positive yearly reviews) its a nuanced way of conveying that you can still have a satisfying career but not as an executive.

","There is very poor morale and work-life balance among almost all levels of employment here. Shifts are always longer than anticipated and stress and fatigue are pervasive.

","However, this industry and company has changed dramatically. If you want to impact healthcare this is a great place to do it but understand there are significant challenges now that didn't exist just a few years ago: 
1. R&D is harder and more expensive, 
2. the public and most levels of government generally do not understand the complexity of healthcare at all and mostly think by simply passing a single piece of legislation all of healthcare's issues will be resolved (targeting pharmaceuticals), 
3. access to providers is 4x harder than it was 10 years ago, and 
4. the med-legal red tape just keeps getting deeper. 

Bottom line: this industry just went from ""easy / moderate"" to ""stressful"". This industry is about to shrink a little in headcount and become a little leaner and more efficient. The political climate may adversely impact the industry. Hopefully not.

","I found that most employees at Merck have been there for decades. This unfortunately results in many people who have not learned new skills and seem to be unmotivated to change themselves or their workstreams, which resulted in industry best-practices not being followed. It honestly felt like people at Merck operated in a bubble that was 15 years behind in digital marketing (saying this even taking into consideration legal pharma issues).

I found it was nearly impossible to move anything forward in an environment where there is so much bureaucracy, hierarchy, politics, and sensitivity. Co-workers often seemed to justify their jobs by strangle-holding their workstreams instead of collaborating openly and without ego.

It often feels like everyone is trying as hard as possible to not do anything, but still trying to appear as if they are doing something. The feeling of obfuscation is overwhelming.

The physical building culture is also not ideal - in an era where many offices are going remote, the Merck UG campus building remains something straight out of Office Space.
Advice to Management
Strip the marketing departments back down to basics and ensure that sensitive egos are put aside at the door. Allow newer people to make a difference by supporting them and ensuring that everyone is open to change.

Also reduce employee count and just make sure the employees that matter are doing their jobs. There is so much overlap and unnecessary headcount.

Sat Jul 13 2019, Senior Engineer,"West Point, PA",Current Employee ,7 Years at Merck,8,"A lot of opportunity - I'm a chemical engineer in manufacturing. I've been fortunate enough to work on 5 unique processes in 7 years (both locally and internationally), and learn from some very bright people. 

Competitive salaries and benefits, retirement retirement benefit specifically is better than competitive. The 401k would be decent on its own, and there is a pension on top of it.

Work-life balance is great in some departments

Ethical culture. Focus on serving patients (at least in manufacturing - I'm not in the rooms where they decide what we're going to charge for our products).
","VERY VERY bureaucratic. Not sure why senior management thinks that the solution to every problem is to create a new system with a complex approval process. And this bureaucratic culture is not just related to regulatory compliance (where bureaucracy is a given) . In at least one case there is a business approval process you need to follow before you are allowed to move on and then follow the compliance approval process (which includes another business approval). The bureaucracy permeates every aspect of live at Merck. 

A very conservative company. The first , second, and third instincts are to do it the way we've always done it. I don't think Merck is a place to go if you want to trail blaze. In most aspects of science and technology, Merck is 5-10 years behind. For example we just figured out monoclonal antibodies a few years ago (while everyone else was adopting them in the 90's).

Very silo-ed company. Different organizations are evaluated against very different criteria. Different departments all have their own agendas. It makes forming truly collaborative and cross functional teams difficult.

Work-life balance is not always great. I listed this as a pro too as it very's by department. I've had 4 distinct rolls at the company. 2 were predominantly low stress with roughly 40hr work weeks. The other 2 were much worse. Under 50hrs was a good week, 60+ was frequent. Pressure from management can become intense, and when projects are managed badly the first thing to get sacrificed is always the private lives and well being of those at the bottom of the org structure. The sacrifice is not always rewarded either. 

There is a bit of perverse incentive in the way the company handles it's best employees. When you are identified as an ambitions and talented employee you are usually sent off to work on projects that have fallen behind - the idea being you can ride over the hill on a white horse and save the project. The problem is that those projects usually fall behind because they have bad management and bad cultures (i.e. not because of problems one person can step in fix no matter how talented they are), or just because they're ""behind"" goals that were never realistic in the first place. Being sent off to those projects is not exactly a reward worth working hard for.

Top down decision making, thus decision makers are out of touch with the the actual consequences of their decision (a problem that I'm sure most large companies have) 

Health benefits are a little below average

Company is actually ethical and interested in helping people - can't be said for all of big pharma.

Solid drug pipeline and strong growth of current drugs = stability.
","Good employee development means a lot of internal movement which can make things difficult.

Despite being rewarding for high performers, poor or incompetent individuals are rarely fired. This means useless bodies clogging up higher individual contributer positions.If youre lazy I suppose you could call this a pro....

Some systems have gotten too bureaucratic making process improvement difficult at times.

Big company means some people you interact with / rely on are not in your reporting structure. This can make it difficult to resolve delays or problems with these people.

Really start caring about your employees more and less about yourself. The people that work here make this company survive.

Overall, if you're starting your career, stay away from Merck or any pharma company. There's no future in pharma sales.

Merck has the most ridiculous year end performance reviews ever. You get stacked ranked no matter how well you did. Some people had great sales numbers but poor rankings because their manager didn't like them. Overall, a lot of politics involved with the reviews. If you like to play the game, Merck is the company for you.

Merck is a very conservative company. Their policy and procedures will drive you crazy. Stay away if you want to grow your career or want any kind of job security. You're not going to get it at Merck.

Followup on ACTUAL employee concerns is left to senior leaders who created the situation in the first place, and who have no clue on how to address real issues. Work/life balance is non-existent.

","GHH leadership in the hub is terrible. The one awesome AD we had was let go for something so incredibly ridiculous. Morale is low now.

Simple things are overly complex.

Do not bring the NE to Austin. No one listens or understands Austin's culture and they do not want to. We'll keep the ""founding father"" though. Keep bad management where they are. They only come to Austin and are worse. Pay for parking...its the norm in Austin. Treat people right.

Fri Aug 17 2018, Sales,"Philadelphia, PA",Current Employee ,Sales Specialist,1,"Competitive benefits overall vs. average employer. Huge focus on ethics, integrity, execution with excellence. The R&D at Merck is world class - somehow they keep creating great products (although at the last second before the patent cliff). Global operations are excellent. Senior management (most) are outstanding (but moving up internally is like watching a glacier move).
","1. Merck limits US sales reps to behave as robots and repeat canned messages so it’s not really sales. 2. Access to doctors is diminishing, 3. Pricing pressure is unfairly eroding profits (TBD), and 4. The company, like most of big pharma, is WAY behind in digital technology compared to the tech industry - if you’re into technology do not work in pharma or you’ll go crazy at how behind tech is here, and 5. Lay-Offs! This industry has it’s hay-day in the 90s, then the fertilizer hit the ventilator and thousands were laid off - and the growth rate today in revenues and profits are struggling. Do not get into this industry unless you are HYPER-passionate about creating and commercializing medicines.
Advice to Management
The CEO’s own daughter skipped pharma and went to work in Silicon Valley - what does that tell you about the current state of big pharma? Not good. 
Dear Management: 1. Please bring the company and “big pharma” into the 21st century with digital health innovation and make Merck a “cool” and fun place to work (now it’s a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10), and 2. Find a way for sales reps to be “uncapped” in W-2 and actually make a decent living to support their families - a life sales at Merck is a life wasted (especially in compensation). It’s professionally and financially structured to be a dead-end career path. You will *never* make enough money to support a family in sales for Merck unless you start out of college and work your way up to Director or higher (2% chance).

","I worked at CROs for over 10 years and decided to try pharma as Merck was builiding its own oncology clinical teams and I believed that it would be an exiting time to join the company. Merck is new to oncology and the middle managers don't understand the complexity of oncology trials. I was assigned to so many sites and different protocols, that it was hard to keep up, even if with working 60-80 hours a week. I worried about the quality of the research, as systems were very old and the way of conducting the research was old as well. Sites I took over from other CRAs had huge data backlog. Instead of managing the sites and doing quality research, I was reviewing data from the past months and was resolving old issues. I brought this to the attention of my manager, and what bothered me the most was indifference. The supervisor of the managers had the same attitude and during the calls was more concerned about keeping the agenda than answering questions from the CRAs. This is the company where the CRAs were treated with the least respect. I left the company in less than a year. Quality of the research was my main concern.

I have been working at Merck full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
The pay and retirement programs are competitive.
Cons
The lack of organization, communication, planning, accountability, process knowledge and proper training is astonishing. That's just to name a few of the problems. All these concerns aren't just on the production floor, but yet they span all levels. I would suggest exhausting all other options and only take a job here as a last resort. It is, without question, the most poorly ran organization I have ever seen.
Advice to Management
Try learning the process you oversee. Spend time being a direct witness to the daily struggles your poor management skills cause. Try listening to all the voices that have attempted to speak up over the years and give them the attention they deserve. The production numbers speak for themselves. The voices need no other validation. The process is broken and those who are running the process are lost and confused, but will never admit their faults. They will likely run the plant (Durham, NC) completely to the ground or headquarters will have to step in and do a complete overhaul. Either way, the only way to succeed is to stop everything you're doing and go in the opposite direction. If your goal was to waste as much time, effort and money as you possibly could, your efforts would be at the pinnacle. No one does it better.
