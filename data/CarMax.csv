I worked at CarMax full-time
Pros
The co-workers were great. Most sales managers were great. Some of the LGM's were great. The 401k was good.
Cons
The pay is terrible. The PTO was not good. Healthcare, vision, and dental were expensive. They only care about the share holders. I worked there for a total of five years. The first year making the most money. Every year we took a pay cut. The first year I made around 50-55k. By year five I made 30-35k working more hours than year one. I only stayed because I was comfortable and enjoyed helping people. I also enjoyed helping co-workers as a team. I finally had to leave so that I could make a better living for my family and I. At first it felt like I was working for a great sales job and then when I left it felt like a retail store job (very robotic).
Advice to Management
Middle management: Find another job that pays you for what you are worth. There were some managers that were truly great people who did their best that deserve better. Some middle management tried to help you get the sale and help the customers while others sat by the computer all day putting the work on the other middle managers. Some had no idea how to lead by example. They would just do the bare minimum to not get fired and act like a corporate robot. Those managers could care less about the sales consultants or even the other middle managers. They should really have some pride in the company and the co-workers wearing the blue shirt. We are on the same team after all. 

Senior management: Get rid of the couple managers that bring the whole store morale down. I did like some of the senior managers. Some were great people who got worn down by the home office. If home office would treat them the way they deserved I could see them being happy. It is hard to lead from the front when all front office does is constantly give the people lower on the totem pole pay cuts. I also know that they could care less if people leave because corporate has taught you to have no soul towards human beings. We are just a number that will be quickly replaced. I really can not blame some of the managers because that is the type of leadership that the corporate guys from home office taught them. I hope the corporate office wakes up one day and remembers that the people on the bottom help hold up all the people on the top.

I have been working at CarMax full-time for less than a year
Pros
- 6% salary/wage 401(k)/401 Roth match for full-time employees

- other okay-ish benefits

- decent pay when you're young and just trying to find someplace to work
Cons
- strict policies governing sick time, vacation time, and unpaid time off (especially as a Customer Experience Consultant/CXC!):
1. I kid you not: only EIGHT (8!) days of vacation time per year, and you can't carry over more than that to the next year, so a grand total of 16 days per year is the absolute maximum for anyone who's worked there for under 5 years - the real kicker: it accrues at a rate of about the same pace as sick time, meaning your three day vacation will have to wait about half a year (plus the 3 months it takes to start accruing)
2. Unpaid time off doesn't exist when working as a Customer Experience Consultant. You can give them a YEAR'S notice, and they'll tell you no. This is NOT company policy, since you can, in fact, take unpaid time off when working in the store (traditional roles such as floor sales consultant, business office associate, etc.). It's predatory at best, and immoral at worst.
3. Due to being able to accrue sick and vacation time, calling out because you're sick without being able to cover that full shift will cause you to get a ""point,"" which is part of a system where getting too many of those in a half year will result in you being fired from the company. Very generous system indeed.

- CarMax is an evil company who preys upon its customers with insanely high APR's on vehicle purchases, they sell vehicles they know aren't worth even a fraction of what they charge, and they often skip their supposed quality inspection entirely, making a customer who was in urgent need of a vehicle realize that the purchase will have to wait another two weeks due to repairs. I cannot in good faith support this any longer, and am looking for a way out.

- CarMax actively engages in anti-union propaganda and union-busting.
Advice to Management
Start treating your employees like something better than starved farm animals. Let CXC's take unpaid time off every now and then. And, for the love of all that's holy, update the CXC bonus structure; it's messed up you punish people for all the wrong reasons. This is someone's livelihood you're messing with. Also, some CarMax managers need to stop acting like they're God. Pathetic behavior.

Oh, also, union-busting, as well as anti-union propaganda, is borderline illegal - and for a good reason. Unfortunately, though, you've both found and familiarized yourselves with how to conduct both of those things legally, so good job on that.

","Management team has gone down the drain after 2019. They went from employee come first to now i cant even speak to a coworker without the managers pulling me aside to tell me to stop talking even if it was to check in with my coworker. They also block us from speaking to other employees that are needed to get our jobs done. Ex. I need a missed tear done on a car. I go to a repair specialist down the shop to finish the car. The management now restricts me to get a specialist to finish the job due to them claiming I’m just killing time by talking about outside work topics. This place thrives when we work as a team but they lost trust in us and their focus is in the managements’ weekly bonuses when the team hits goal. Car quality has gone down. As someone who has worked here when they first open 4 years, I highly suggest avoid working here unless you come for the paycheck. It’s frustrating and 89% of the team hates their job here. We tried to give feedback but management hid the complaints from HR.
Advice to Management

Removing email and phone leads from individual sales associate fundamentally changed the position for the worse in my opinion. The company will probably be better for this change though for customer service. Sales associate position will become less important as the company moves further into e-commerce. Our LGM essentially paced around the property all day and wasn't exactly a great support system for sales managers or consultants. He was also a bit prone to a temper tantrum.

Thu Jan 07 2021, Business Office Associate,"Dulles, VA",Former Employee ,Decent job. Can be hectic if you work at a high volume store,0,"Friendly co-workers. Most are willing to help if they can or even have a chat with you.

Benefits

Hours are pretty flexible, although you are required to have open availability on weekends, they will try their best to schedule you in your preferred time frames

The work itself may seem daunting at first, but comes pretty easy after a short time. You are essentially the paperwork person when it comes to the customer's car purchase/selling. Once you get a handle on the paperwork, the process becomes natural. Highly recommended that you are a people person or at least willing to hold a conversation.
","The business office is the go-to for any customer service complaints. Even if it is something that is completely out of your hands, they will be headed towards or calling you. Its not all bad of course, but be ready.

Higher traffic and volume stores have a high tendency to stay open long past their operating hours either from last minute purchases or customers still waiting to be helped. Some seasons (like the summer) will be worse than others in this regard. Keep this in mind if you plan to be on the closing shift.

Not much career growth or anything to really aim for except employee of the month.

Higher volume stores leave little room for down time to catch your breath on busy days.
Advice to Management
Although I enjoyed my time working there, there needs to be something to aim for. Also In my time of working there, there was an underlying attitude of blame shifting between the departments at the store i was in, this resulted in early signs of unnecessary passive aggression and pressure. Department heads should aim to rectify these behaviors as soon as they become apparent as it leads to unhealthy work environments.

Advice to Management
Innovation is great, but don't change at the expense of the people that work for you.
It seems the company is trying to eliminate or greatly reduce the need the for sales consultants. 
First, the introduction of the CEC, or call center, splits the commission in half regardless of the amount of work completed. So, we have real scenarios when an appointment is automatically scheduled by the customer, the sales consultant does all of the work, and gets paid $80. Maybe $40 if another consultant helped. $40 commission for selling a car! Improve CEC or increase commissions.
Second, moving the goal posts for sales clubs. Instead of making pay richer for high performers, the entry to President's club is harder to get in to. You basically just cut the pay of hundreds of sales consultants.
In a climate where employers are trying to pay their employees more, Carmax is searching for ways to pay employees less.
Maybe the day of well paid sales consultants is coming to an end.

","ULTIMATE corporate experience; all about the numbers. Everything done on the cheap, so expect broken and shoddily repaired facilities. RA's are expected to do jobs that no one else will do.

Larger stores deal with heavier work loads and get paid the same.
Advice to Management
Act like you care about your employees for the short time you'll be managing them. Discipline employees when necessary. Don't ask your employees to do something you wouldn't do yourself. Make improvements that benefit the team, do not become stagnant as a manager. Why do you think employee turnover rate is so high?

If the inventory department is backed up or short staffed you will have to prep your own car if you're selling it. If you are scheduled to report to work at 9 you will have to move cars and help organize the parking lot. Those are all duties of hourly associates but if you work in sales all you get is ""Great Teamwork Guys"".

There’s nothing you can do without changes above you. This company is very successful, that needs to be reflected in the salaries of the good folks that have made that possible. Carmax’s hiring process is very good, they bring in many high quality people. We lose many of those people because they can’t make ends meet on carmax pay. I could name dozens of very talented former employees that statement applies to. Ultimately carmax will never live up to it’s full potential unless it completely revises employee pay so that we can live comfortably.

Management could care less about you, they will go on about how you’re part of the team and can grow but you never will. Carmax will never admit they are at fault, neither will the managers. Carmax in no way shape or form cares for their employees unless you’re in a senior management roll. They will cut your wages and will not cover any sort of expenses or reimbursement. Look elsewhere if you need a job, the pay they promise is a complete lie and they will screw you over QUICK.

I worked at CarMax full-time for more than a year
Pros
Very positive, stable environment and company. I don't know if every Carmax is like this one was, or if it was just the exceptional management team I had. But I loved working with all these people. That's hard to find, particularly in a high stress environment. There were no feuds between shifts or departments. Everyone did whatever they could as soon as they could when you needed help. Most of my co-workers were comedians and pranksters in the rare down time. But in dealing with other shops on the phone, I suspect this culture is company wide. Also, they have pretty good flexibility as far as changing departments, positions and even locations.
Cons
Everything about this business is high pace and high stress. Pay is on the lower end for the industry.

I have been working at CarMax full-time for more than a year
Pros
You get to work with some pretty cool people, and learn how to build connection and rapport with customers. It is a great way to get sales experience for sure. Benefits are actually pretty rad, definitely a perk. This is a good place to get sales experience. Some people can make a good career out of it depending on how hard you work. That being said, it's also a numbers game, so your success isn't always in your control.
Cons
The compensation structure is a huge con. You are considered a ""commissioned"" employee but you only get your commission pay if you exceed your base pay. Since the restructuring of pay, and the new call centers, consultants are getting paid less per deal. There are no bonuses or incentives to meet your goals, the new club level requirements are crazy, to reach your numbers you need to sell twice the amount of cars as before.
Advice to Management
Change the commission structure! Consultants are doing most of the time are doing 100% of the work for half and sometimes quarter of the pay. Pay should be hourly PLUS commission.

They would feed you and have celebrations at various times throughout the year
Coworkers were cool 
Sometimes generous discount
Can sit (unusual for retail)
","Fast pace, annoying customers, heavy workload, poor work life balance, work weekends and nights. 

I started about 2 years ago, they kind of just throw you out there. training is very poor. You sit in front of a computer screen for 8 hours watching videos, then they throw you into the line of fire just tell you ask questions when you need help. Customers can be rude when they don't get their way. Sales consultants think they are the only people in the company that matter so they have very little empathy for you and whatever you may be doing. You will work Saturdays, lucky to get one off a month. Other associates get special treatment shift wise. Some will work mostly morning shifts while you're stuck closing (until 10-11) three nights a week. It was doable at first for me, but as the years grew on I got tired of everything. Since the pandemic you can tell Carmax only cares about the money, telling positive tested associates not to tell coworkers and not disclosing to those who worked in close proximity. They pay was okay, but for the amount of work you do it should be higher. (Vroom pay starting at $18). You probably won't move up. You may get a lead position, but movement after that is very rare. Probably won't ever make more than $18/hour working in the business office unless you become the Business Office Manager or the assistant.

You learn a lot about cars and financing.
Unlimited overtime, and you always get your overtime on top of your hourly or incentive.
Cons
Pay is incentive or hourly. It is whichever is higher, not both. 
Splitting incentive is not always even. You might work with a customer for 6 hours and the other consultant worked with them for 20 minutes and you have to split the sale.
Mixed direction from management. One manager will tell you to do one thing and the next will tell you not to do it.
Constantly changing schedule. You will usually not get two days off together and they will most likely be weekdays. And the days you have off change weekly, which makes it hard to plan things outside of work.
Advice to Management
Make sure all managers are telling consultants to do the same thing the same way. Try to give consultants two days off together.

Sat Aug 29 2020,Anonymous,"Olathe, KS",Current Employee ,Overall a good place to work,2,"Good compensation for salaried IT full time IT role, decent benefits. A truly friendly work environment without as much negativity as other places I have worked. IT group manages change decently well. Management tries to communicate and is generally open - I do feel like the managers care about me as a person more than some other places. The company has survived the pandemic relatively well financially and was able to bring back most full time people who were furloughed as well as some contractors relatively quickly - I do think furloughs were unavoidable when over half of the retail locations were shut down at one point or another. The craziness of some of the work that had to happen for the pandemic was acknowledged and they tried to manage work-life balance and rewards at a time when that was very difficult to do well.
Training program for hourly sales does seem designed to help people succeed. As used car salesmen go, they are more open and honest than most - people who work there do buy cars from there.
","Too much separation between what the main headquarters thinks is happening in the stores/contact centers and what is actually happening - executives simply do not have control over what is happening in other physical locations. Managers on power trips run the show, and while it is clear that they are trying to be diverse it isn't truly working yet and the boys network is alive and well. Some legacy tech is holding the company back from its full potential and IT investment is somewhat scattered - I would proritize other projects/hiring over some of the things that have gotten investment. 
For covid-19 if they didn't HAVE to shut down a particular location by government mandate, they didn't, and some of the social distancing practices are a joke. For a company that makes a big deal about caring for its employees, I did not feel they took my safety seriously but rather cared more about looking like they were doing something more than actually helping. People at headquarters are safely working at home while asking everyone else to physically come in - obviously some roles like the service departments can't be done remotely, but they could do more remotely in other roles.
Seems like the usual sucking up and playing favorites around people getting promoted to management roles - in over a year I haven't seen anyone move from hourly to management yet (and there have been management spots open). Promotions seem to take a while.
Hourly roles seem somewhat micromanaged - there are particular sales scripts, strict rules about what can be on a desk, etc.
Advice to Management
Stop sweeping problems with legacy tech under the rug - bite the bullet and upgrade things properly like you should have before some of the operational changes happening pre-covid. Get your regional managers and below under control - keep tabs on what's happening in the field day to day. Upper level managers seem ok but there is rot in the middle. Don't micro-manage people too heavily in the hourly roles - you make a big deal about hiring the right people, so trust them to do the right thing.

Flexible scheduling, good benefits for full time associates, honestly an easy sales position.
Cons
Pay, Feedback and criticisms seem pointless, inconsistent policy enforcement makes it hard to know what to do in unique situations - especially with COVID-
Advice to Management
Know the policy even half as good as some of the other sales consultants. The company should pay its Sales people a lot better. Or at the very least don't cut their commissions to level where you cannot support yourself. And right after COVID pandemic to boot.

I have been working at CarMax full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Easy to get hired; check pulse...close enough! Hired! Have to pass drug screening and I’ve had mentees fired two weeks into training for failing the drug test. 

Pays ok about as decent as it gets without an education requirement.

Benefits are consistent with the size of the company nothing amazing but in line with other companies this size.
Cons
Laid off 15k people in states that forced them to close. Not a safe place to work customers come in without masks, forced to drive customers cars, and the job doesn’t feel secure anymore regardless of your ability. It has become very “Sorry this is how it is.” 

Work for the pay has become very bad with nearly all commissions being reduced to 1/2 and many to as little as a quarter. 

#1 salesman in the company steals customers from what is supposed to be a randomly assigned store book of business and he gets congratulated after being turned in to The leadership team multiple times.

Pay better! Quit the stupid awards and start offering better pay incentives.

When it came out that I was looking for a job with better pay I was pulled into the Buying Managers office and yelled at because Carmax had “invested so much time and money” into training me. Instead of trying to intimidate your employees to stick around, you should incentivize them with better pay.

Also, there should be absolutely zero political discussion. I shouldn’t have to listen to others in my office arguing about race relations due to politics or some senior citizen complain about how he thinks millennials are ruining this country. Extremely unprofessional for a fortune 100 company.

Some mgmt care. Mostly good place to work.
Cons
The new CEC do nothing but cut our pay in half. Was supposed to save time to see more people and 90% of the time it is messed up and takes longer to complete a deal. If someone puts a car on hold or online finance without ever speaking to a CEC (customer experience center) person you get half of normal commission. These people are paid with our commission cuts and top guys get bigger bonuses. When we used to have our eoffice, if the same scenario happened there would not be a split and the other person got the whole commission due to no contact. Total contradiction. They have effectively reduced my annual pay by at least 20% at the current rate of the number of 1/2's or 1/4 deals. Trying to talk to regional mgmt give lip service when bringing up concerns. It was a total joke when they were at our store to promote the process. If you make too much noise your told to hush or you become insubordinate. Unless you kiss up you will not get promoted as it is a good 'ol boys club. So if you make noise ^^ say good by to moving up.

Great work environment unlike anything I’ve ever seen. You’re truly part of a team and all no coworkers regardless of which locations I’ve worked at have all been amazing. There’s a great team spirit and culture here and even the higher ups are friendly. Pay is decent too. Most consultants average around $50,000 a year with bottom performers making about $33,000 and top performers making around $80,000. If you’re an average performer you can get about $50,000 a year here. They let you be easy going with customers and teach you great sales skills. It never feels like a sales job because there’s no quotas. They also really try to move you to management as soon as you let them know you want to do it they help set a path for you to reach your goals and get there where most other places won’t make any effort to help you.

Thu Mar 12 2020, Sales Manager,"Laurel, MD",Former Employee ,Typical Retail Management,5,"Pay is on-par with other big box retailers, Offers medical, dental, vision, 401k, monthly bonus, stock grants.

Demo vehicle you can personally drive after 4 years of service in SM role.

It's a great place to work when times are good. You can make a lot of money if you and the Sales Manager team that you work with are competent. 

You can stay busy all the time. The customer traffic is often plentiful. 

Some really great people work there. At the store level, there is usually a sense of team spirit and you will work around people that are usually willing to pitch in to help when needed.
","Firstly, this is not """"retail-adjacent"" or ""better than retail."" It's a mix of traditional car sales and retail. 

As one of nearly 500+ Sales managers in the company, you are just a number. Your store manager may care, but he is going to be at the whim of the RVP. Sometimes you will be selected to ""choose"" to go to another store, and the politics are such that you will be looked upon negatively if you don't go ""for the company."" 

Hours are unnecessarily long (min. 10 hour shifts). You are busy every minute of that time. Typically you have the minimum coverage possible (they even eliminated some SM positions a while ago for ""efficiency"" (some found new positions, some were just laid off). If you are looking for a job that encourages you to spend time with your family, this isn't it. And don't schedule anything on a set day of the week, your schedule rotates and you'll be working some of those days.

When the business is having a tough time, you're getting a tough time from your manager. Stuff rolls downhill and CarMax is no exception. You have a daily budget for how many cars you're supposed to sell and at the end of the month that performance factors into your bonus and review for that month).

Little consideration is given for any kind of training. While their training programs exist, as usual it is simply a lack of execution. You will be asked to conduct training each morning for the sales team that were haphazardly constructed the week before by people who don't work in any store.

Constant change. Sometimes it's for the better, sometimes not. If you are looking for a job that's consistent, this isn't it. 

One last thing: Though it only affect Sales Manager indirectly, it should be said: The pay for SCs is consistent across the country; the cost of living is not. In low cost of living states you can make a decent living. If you live in a market like LA or Boston, you cannot survive on only SC pay. Also, it is only commission with a draw, not any set hourly wage that you don't have to pay back. All of this means that you will likely find it difficult to keep SCs, and you will have constant churn. New people to find and hire, to train, etc. This is a major sticking point for SCs; in more expensive markets they will often be struggling financially and unhappy because of it. I would make sure you know this if going to work at CarMax in a more expensive area.


One anecdote to illustrate my frustration: I was a store manager who was driving a demo. I was at the store and the snow was getting worse and worse. I recommended to the RVP that we close the store immediately so people could get home safely. It took 3 hours to get the okay to close, and by then the roads were terrible; luckily, I sent all the staff I could have home. I was the last person in the store, left, and was in an accident in my CarMax demo vehicle (it was not a faulted accident due to weather). If my recommendation was followed, I would have been home. Even better, the RVP wrote me up for getting into the accident.

Pay is way less than I expected. You get $160 per car, and if the customer started online or on the phone first (which most do) that’s cut in half to $80. The idea is the sale has already been made for you, but that’s virtually never the case. Even if the only work that’s been done is an appointment for a test drive your pay for that sale is immediately cut in half. I’ve worked 12 hour days that ended up being a single $80 sale.

I worked at CarMax full-time for more than a year
Pros
•Insurance Benefits are good
•They seem to feed you all the time, at least once a week
•Local management genuinely cares about the people that work for them
•Opportunities to work with charity events as a team from location.
Cons
•While your sick-leave is accumulated per pay period to allow for you to be sick up to 2 weeks a year, but as a commissioned sales person you are only paid at minimum wage for your sick-leave taken.
The company requires you to wear everything except your pants and shoes •Carmax branded. All shirts, Jackets, Sweaters, Hats, and even your water bottle have to be purchased through the company store at your own expense. It isn't until you make ""President's Club"" that they give you any type of allowance for company store. That is a minimum of 90 vehicles in a 6 month period with a 55% attachment rate for the vehicle extended service plan to qualify for. When you leave the company they will not take back your clothing items you had to purchase.
•Poor work life balance, if you are struggling to make it for a month, management will tell you to work extended hours
•Poor Scheduling, Unless you're ""President's Club"" your schedule is determined for the needs based around the fact that ""President's Club"" employees pick their schedules. This means don't plan on ever getting off before 9:00 at night.
•Stores that aren't Cross Functional or on the new Omni-channel are required to have e-office 3-days a week. This a a 3-hour period where you are scheduled to take inbound calls and web leads. This will make you unavailable to schedule appointments or take walk-in customers during this time. During off-peak times, you may received none or one lead for the whole 3 hour period.
•Management uses ""President's Club"" as a crutch for every issue may have with your schedule or pay, stating that its ""Because of President's Club"" or""If you were In President's Club""
•You are paid minimum wage or $160 per car plus commission on extended service plans, GAP, and accessories, whichever is higher, with the minimum wage being recoverable, meaning if you don't make it one pay period, they will take your pay out of your next pay periods until its paid back. When you make ""President's Club"" this goes up but the average sales consultant in the company makes $35-40k a year and ""President's Club"" Sales consultants on average make $40-60k a year. With the same amount of hard work and dedication, and available pay scheduled at competitor dealerships, you can make much more money elsewhere.
•Local management doesn't seem to have any way to convey issues faced to lower employees to the company as Carmax seems to lack a ""Grass Roots"" program and seems to face problems with free food and other things that don't solve problems but try and distract people from the issues.
Advice to Management
For as much food as the company offered me the money spent on that I would have rather received in the form of credit to the company stores. Having worked in a store that wasn't Omni-channel with a 70% ""President's Club"" sales consultant staff. My web leads were severely impacted as I was scheduled the majority of my shifts during off-peak times, many time yielding as little as none or one lead for the 3 hour period. I would only recommend working here to a friend to learn valuable interpersonal skills, but I would not recommend that they stay there longer than a year or two, unless they make President's Club. Granted with the new structure of Omni-Channel rolling out to all stores by the end of the year, my views could have changed as e-office is going to be eliminated and the timing factors recognized by the company will be greatly impacted.

","There were clicks that would feed each other deals and find ways to underhandedly take deal from others. They managers enforced the rules to certain employee but not others. Sales associates were made to go behind inventory and put the cars where they actually were suppose to go. Fixing the lot could eat up the entire day and you would lose a full day of possible sales. No one actually cleaned and inspected the cars when they reached the store, they would be filthy. The sales associated were left doing finance, test drive, clean and prep the car for presenting it to the customer and still received the base pay after doing all the jobs that others were paid to do but refused to put effort into doing. certain sales associates would sit at the front as to try and take other peoples customers that they knew had an appointment. They would also hand off customers that they didn't believe were going to buy and after you spent weeks helping the customer find the right car and get their financing in order, they would purposely contact that customer and put it in the sales force that tracks interactions, so that you were forced to split. For the most part, you never stopped working and the hours that were put into selling the car never seemed worth the little amount they paid out. Sales associates get paid the same when they sell a versa as they would an amg. There were times that I would work with a customer for three weeks and I would spend hours with this customer and still get the same pay as for the customers that come in and were in signing after 45 minutes of walking through the door.

The employees at my location that were making the most, were also working the most hours. You'll hear a lot about ""work life balance,"" but with the way sales is structured its really hard to do. Have plans on your day off, but a transfer car came in? Either get to work or lose half the sale. Customer shows up unexpectedly? Show up or lose the sale. It's not that all of these problems fall on Carmax as a company, but a big issue was for management sales always come before the sales consultant, and I don't really think there's a way to fix that.

Mon Jan 27 2020,Anonymous,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Not the worst company I’ve worked for,3,"Good training and good focus on its employees and their development. Management has an open door policy and they’re pretty good at listening to the concerns of their employees. They also do a lot of charity work. Good company to start off as entry level office work.
","This is not a job for people with a lot of experience or a job you could rely on to pay bills. Most of my colleagues previously worked in retail and were 20-22, whereas I have 5 years of professional experience. I took it as an in between job to make money while I found a better job and it was good for that, but the pay did not match the cost of living. The pay is ok if you’re entry level. The training is good for entry level people, but felt like I was being talked to like a child. Most of the management in my department consisted of 21 year olds and it’s incredibly hard to respect the authority of people barely old enough to buy alcohol. Whenever they handled escalated matters, it sounded as if they were going off a script whereas the older employees sounded like they had lived experience.
Advice to Management
My only advice would be to maybe focus more on hiring seasoned professionals over college students. I am not ageist because I am quite young myself, but I am now hesitant to buy a car from this company due to the inexperience of the people they employ. I would not feel safe making one of the biggest decisions being assisted by people who likely don’t even pay their own bills. Most of the time they didn’t even know what they were saying and when I tried to correct them going off of my years of loan industry experience, they would still give false information to customers. I felt they did not handle escalated matters very well and made situations worse in a lot of cases. I am not sure if every store functions this way, but if they do, this would be a good area to focus on.

It’s simply not a great place to grow. CarMax will always get an A+ from me when it comes to work culture and creating an environment that makes people enjoy being at work. Many managers are easy to get along with and if you’re in the right department, your coworkers won’t feel like coworkers but start to feel like family. That’s where it stops.
","Where CarMax struggles is their lack of growth in many departments when it comes to employees. They’re willing to adapt to make changes to appease customers but not willing to adapt to keep their employees happy. CarMax is a revolving door. Which I guess is to be expected at a dealership. Low salary, expensive benefits packages, and lack of opportunities at the store level are just a few of the many things wrong with this place. The only growth comes at the corporate of auto finance level which should be easier to get into when you’re already an employee but it’s feels almost harder with all the hoops you have to jump through. If you’re just looking for a place to make a little extra money or get on your feet while you’re figuring life out, then I would 100% say work here. But if you’re looking for a company that you can stay for years with worthwhile growth opportunities at both the store and corporate level, I’d say look elsewhere.

Advice to Management
From the start to the end of my CarMax career the two factors I feel have the biggest impact on the company is the emphasis on how CarMax employees should make customer's feel at all times and company expansion. It's correct to want customer's to have an unrivaled experience but if you are driving robotic emotions through your associates it ends up not benefiting you in the long run. It symbolizes that you put your customer's feelings above your associates needs. If the company makes a huge profit, share that profit with the whole company. Give the associates that you have raises and bonuses to retain them. Don't focus on expansion of more stores before you have focused on expanding your team's buy-in.

Take this quote by Richard Branson as a piece of feedback that explains what CarMax needs to do to retain associates and drive it's business to levels of success never seen.

","If you are in the market to buy a car and Carmax is on your list keep one thing in mind. If you go online to the website and request information, hold a car, transfer a car or so much as try to call the store to ask any question at all the company takes half of your sales person’s commission!! 
This is not a negative post just want you to know how the person that will be responsible for taking care of you and your next car is or is not getting paid. They did NOT reduce the price of the vehicles you will be considering nor will you get any other breaks in APR or service plans. That money is kept by Carmax as profit and to “expand”. Please, keep this in mind and if you would share, that would be great. I would love to see Carmax customers speak out, leave feedback on Carmax website or Facebook. If you think it’s good, say it’s good. But if you don’t, please say something. No other business that I know of cuts the employees pay because the customer called the store first or went to their website. I promise, they don’t care what the employees think, maybe they will care what their customers think.

I worked at CarMax full-time for more than a year
Pros
When I started in was a fairly good place to get a feel for the car business with some training and good customer opportunities
Cons
The pay was always low by car industry standards and if you wanted to make a career of car sales moving to a traditional dealer was always necessary. But omni channel will make working at Carmax not even worthwhile. First, it's a horrible fragmented experience for the customer who will first talk to some minimum wage call center employee that knows nothing about the business. The customer will then be pressured into an ""express pick up."" With this option Carmax doesn't pay it's salespeople anything, instead trying to force low paid hourly employees to be car salespeople. If that fails the customer will arrive for an appointment, only to discover the car they thought was on hold for them wasn't, and all the time they spend on the phone was a waste of time because they have to be sat at a desk wherein the sales person has to go back over everything they discussed with the call center. For this great help the sales person looses half their commission and the customer is set up for a redundant frustrating experience. It sucks for the hourly employees being pulled outside their role for no extra pay, it sucks for sales people that are loosing half their paychecks, and it's frustrating for the customer.

Tue Dec 24 2019, Technology,"Richmond, VA",Former Employee ,They aren't who they say they are,12,"The compensation and benefits are very good. You'll need it though--combat pay.
","Women in Technology have zero opportunities to advance. When I joined the company, there were only two women in Director+ positions in IT. Nearly two years later, there were still only those two. Director roles stayed open for months; men were fast-tracked. Women were told they acted like ""victims"" or weren't technical enough. Nearly every meeting I was in, I was the only one or one of two women in the room--a meeting of 25+ people. 

Add to that the culture overall. ""People First"" is touted from the mountain top, yet those are just words on a page. It really means, ""men first"" or ""only those we choose to be first."" The environment is toxic; it was perfectly acceptable to put over 150 people in a space fire-coded for 50. You couldn't back up your chair to stand up without hitting the person behind you. Tight spaces and unrealistic deadlines made tempers flare. It was not uncommon to see a verbal altercation. 

It is not acceptable to point out where a team or associate is making an error or can improve. It is, however, acceptable to verbally bash and beat up on the person who would suggest (even with data) that an issue exists. 

Management changes their mind with the wind. Goals are not clearly defined and remain fluid--it's like trying to nail smoke to the wall. ""Do the right thing"" is another sentence that has no meaning. Should you have any integrity, it won't be appreciated. If you speak the truth, you will be punished for it. It matters not if your manager is bending the truth like a pretzel; if you tell the truth, you will be retaliated against. 

The company brings in talented people stating they want new ideas. Yet, when new ideas are brought up or change initiated, it is met with fierce resistance. Many tenured associates are ""retired-in-place"" and have no desire to upset the apple cart--even for the good of the company. They aren't held accountable for holding the company back either. The new people are left frustrated wondering why they were recruited to join; feeling like they were treated to a bait-and-switch. They leave and take their talents with them. When a talented Sr. Leader leaves, the company pulls a former one from retirement to backfill. CarMax stays stuck in the past--they tout a new paradigm; yet, look closely, it is all smoke and mirrors. The back end is old, out-of-date systems that are held together by bubble gum and Band-Aides. 

If you are looking for a progressive company who will value your talents and ideas, look elsewhere.

They paid the same amount per vehicle since the company started. They never raised the amount of commission per car to match inflation. 2 months ago, corporate took all the leads away and started sending them to a call center. Everyone in the call center is new and not progressing them well enough to come into the store. Not only that, the pay was cut in half for every sales consultant for the majority of customers. Not only that, but now there's instances where low hourly wage associates can sell cars without commission so sales people don't have to. They keep saying it is going to help us sell more cars. But it is doing the opposite. They took the leads away, they took half our pay away, and they are taking the little customers the stores have and giving them to hourly associates so that they can pay less to the sales team. I am making a third of what I used to make. I am currently seeking other employment options and hope this greedy company gets what it deserves. I don't recommend anyone in any department work here. Service and operations team get treated without respect. Business office is begging forced to do more work without more pay.

I have been working at CarMax full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Truly great people in every store, I made many friends in my time at CarMax. Great training program for sales, including a mentor dedicated to your training. Mentors aren't compensated as much as they should be, which sometimes does affect their attention to your training, as they still must sell cars to make a living. Since CarMax is a nationally known name, you will have consistent opportunities to sell, but the commission structure is low until you advance into President's Club. Once is President's Club, you get great benefits like increased commissions, ability to make your own schedule (with several limitations), use of company vehicles, and a trip to Las Vegas every year. Management varies by location. I've had several General Managers and Sales Managers with mixed results. But overall, I've liked most of my managers. For those who perform, there are opportunities for growth as long as you don't mind long hours, late nights, and working weekends, after all it is retail. Given many locations nationwide, transferring is easy and there are many opportunities to move with CarMax.
Cons
CarMax managers are forced to apply a strict time and attendance policy, and depending on your manager every mistake gets documented. For commission employees who are not paid a base salary or hourly wage, getting points for being one minute late seems extreme. Commission on car sales has only been increased once since CarMax opened in 1993. Micromanagement can extend to your selling technique, with some managers demanding certain verbiage in phone calls and in person interactions.
Advice to Management
Loosen up on the time and attendance policy and other documentation of inconsistent results, and make employees feel valued by highlighting successes as much as the misses. Increase commissions, and listen to employee feedback about managers. When multiple people feel the same way about a manager across stores, there is most likely an issue that needs to be addressed. Make the mentor program more lucrative for mentors and training will improve.

I worked at CarMax part-time for more than a year
Pros
-Made great money but be willing to bust your tail.
-Flexibility if you are part time once you have sold enough cars. 
-Able to sell to all different people at all different credit Levels.
-Great Match for 401k
Cons
-You get penalized when a car gets returned due to mechanical issues. And yes its very common.
-Favoritism is very common. Management favorites certain employees and its obvious by all.
-Sales managers are the punching bag of the company and do not have much if any authority. These are not true managers they just do as the general manager AJ says.
-If there is a complaint they immediately take the side of the customer before even analyzing the situation so that there is not a formal complaint.
-Very little room to grow past the sales manager position.
Advice to Management
Start being managers. Delegate not abuse position. If there were true managers not just sales consultants filling a position there may be more respect. As an employee all five managers were around to include the General Manager, AJ, when an employee quit and they all were so happy. One actually said Thank God one down three to go. Simply unprofessional.

I worked at CarMax full-time for more than a year
Pros
Carmax has an OK pay structure. They offer either hourly or incentive bonus -- whichever is higher.

The company also offers paid time off, vacation time, and sick time, which is nice if you have an emergency situation, though it does take a while to stack up.

Good job for students and/or those who ""just need a job"".

A no-haggle policy that weeds out price-shoppers.
Cons
Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks to working at Carmax. To be fair, this review is based on the location I worked at and my experience. I can't speak for other locations.

For starters, the sales managers at the location I worked at (Pleasanton, CA) are lazy and incompetent at best. They always say to ask them for help, yet never follow-through and never know what's going on. Basically, the majority of your job will be getting them to do their job. It's unfortunate, too—it's almost like they've given up and would prefer to just sit behind a desk, crack jokes, and goof off until payday.

Most of the management has no prior experience in auto sales. Strangely, they take every opportunity to vomit anti-traditional-dealership rhetoric that simply isn't true. This, in my opinion, is cowardly of the management and damaging for new employees who have never worked in car sales before but may want a career in it.

Carmax also has an elementary attendance policy. If you don't have sick time or paid time off and miss a day of work, you accrue a ""point"". Get six points and you're terminated, no exceptions (unless you're friends with management, of course). It's basically a made-up system that retail stores use to keep their employees under control, and it's pretty bad for people who get sick and don't have any paid time off or sick time accrued.

Another downside is Carmax allows no room for creative problem-solving or independent thought. Everything must be done in a box-checking manner, with no exceptions.

Overall, the company is very disorganized and doesn't value their employees very much. They say they do but always demonstrate the opposite. For example, upon my resignation, the company took about 3 weeks to get my final paycheck to me. They also lost my sales license. When I asked where it was, I got multiple answers. Finally, I was told, ""get a new one from DMV. Sorry, don't know what to tell you"". This is just poor accountability.

At the end of the day, Carmax wants everyone to fit into a mold and be the same because they want to ""give every customer the same experience"". There's a major flaw in that thinking. You see, not every customer is the same. Once again, this is a classic example of Carmax treating people as just bodies and not as people.

 If you want to work in car sales, do yourself a favor and work at a regular dealership and learn real skills from real professionals. This is merely a retail sales job like Best Buy disguised as car sales.
Advice to Management
Follow-up on quarterly surveys and take action against management who refuse to make improvements. Encourage problem-solving rather than box-checking. Treat employees like people and not just babies who quiet down when you jingle keys in front of them.

Where do I begin… I started working for Carmax at the store level and then moved to the CSS where I enjoyed my job very much… Then Carmax decides to go with a new Omni channel approach… they call us customer experience consultants but all we are is bodies at desks being told to read Scripts. The bonuses we are all supposed to get would take an MIT graduate to even understand and there are over 200 people here who are up in arms about being exceedingly underpaid and not being paid what they’ve earned. They bring people in from the stores to work leads which take money out of our pockets because that’s the only way we get paid. All the people at the stores who used to make good money now have their commissions cut in half or to zero, because of the new CEC. Management here is punitive and has no clue how to run this business.. the company itself started this with no plan of action with no organization and the only result is… The people that work for them are making a lot less money and Carmax is making a whole lot more money. Everybody at the CEC… Even though we don’t meet with customers… has to wear a Carmax uniform… More money for Carmax.. we are not allowed to have a pen and a piece of paper or any personalization on our desks. There is so much more I could say but what I will tell you is run fast ..do not work for Carmax anymore… They will lie to you they will cheat you and I will steal from you… And I have documented proof of all of this.

","Company is always looking to cut costs. Sales staff has been cut in half along with money to be made.

Cons
Micro management to an extreme level. They have rules and policies for everything. Every department will hate you because you're in sales. The managers could care less about you, you are just a number but they will try hard to pretend otherwise. In my time there I have seen so many good people be fired. They care about nothing but sales. It's also 100% commison so they put no value on you as a sales profesional and they expect you to work a lot for free. And advancement is extreamly unlikely. It is a toxic work environment that I wouldn't recomend to anyone.

I have been working at CarMax full-time for less than a year
Pros
The 401K and company stock programs are amazing. My 401 K has doubled being there for only one year. Sick leave benefits are great although I don't use them much. You do get PTO. The company model is perfect for car sales if only the public would realize that. Carmax stands behind what they preach and sells great cars without mind games or manipulation and I love that about the company. Management is only there to advise and they are pretty helpful most of the time.
Cons
Carmax is really strict and 3 friends of mine were fired this year. The car sales business is full of tirekickers and people don't understand that when they waste your time-you could be helping another customer, and they don't understand the term ""commission only"". There are about 4 months this past year that I made good money and it was wonderful to get somewhat caught up on bills, but then the next month you are poor again. Some sales consultants are able to be really consistent and just have a knack for sales. For a lot of us, its a financial roller coaster. I have made $1300 in a day, and another week only make $50. Carmax doesn't let you starve though, they do give you minimum wage if you didn't make at least that, and then you pay it back if your next pay period was over minimum wage.
Advice to Management
Don't threaten employees or try to scare us if we make a mistake in our job. It isn't funny. If you can't help us at the moment we ask, refer us to someone else. Don't make me wait until you've helped 2 other people. Organize yourself better. Also, managers should not be the one with anxiety. Stop it.

Cons
Not sure where to even begin. I do not think Puyallup, WA is a true reflection of what it is like working at every production store at Carmax. It's still relatively new and still think it's going through ""growing pains"". I had high hopes of working my way up into management and spending many years at this company when I first arrived. Through hard work and showing up on time everyday I was able to get a few promotions. Once I saw how lead associates were being treated by upper management, I decided at that point I had no interest in becoming a lead myself, thus not becoming a manager. Once I reach that point in a company, I no longer want to work there because I can no longer better myself. Pretty much was all downhill from that point forward. Once management finds out you don't want to be apart of their exclusive club they really do not want much else to do with you from that point. I will not get into all that went on with me on a personally level because it was a ton. All I can say is, I was a well respected co-worker and friend to most people that work there and they all felt I was treated horribly for my particular situation. The work environment is TOXIC, regardless of what upper-management will tell you, 80% of the people do not want to be there. The only people who do are new employees, managers themselves, and a few scattered employees who have worked there for 10 years plus. Everyone else just spends the day talking about looking for new jobs, how they hate it there...etc...etc. I can spend a day talking about all the negatives of the place but I really do not even have the time or space. Do yourself a favor, stay FARRRR away. Thing is, i've worked for worse companies and at first, Carmax wasn't like some of those others but it seems like they are slowly turning into just another corporation that you can pick out of a hat and they are all the same. Bad management, average benefits, extreme greed from the people at the top and politics.
Advice to Management

Typical day is 9 hours with 1 hour lunch break, some days you will work 12+ hours when you get a difficult customer. But if you are 1-59 minutes late you get 1/2 of a point, 1 hour or more = 1 point and 6 points in 6 months = termination. 

You have to work a full year before you accrue 40hrs of sick time and 80hrs of vacation time. If you call out or leave early you have to use sick time or you get at least 1 point. A sales consultant once got stuck in Puerto Rico during a hurricane and they were fired for missing work. There is NO compassion or understanding for missing work.

Management can be strict as they focuses very heavily on personal development which can result in 3-8 hours of meetings per week Development meetings take you away from customers and restricts your ability to make sales. The hardest part of the job is customers treating you like a used cars salesperson and ghosting you when you try and do your job to help them.

Most people quit after a year and either get out of sales or go to a real dealership. There is minimal room for promotion. Top earning sales consultants will make more than sales managers.

Mon Aug 19 2019, Reconditioning Associate,"Puyallup, WA",Current Employee ,My store is not a true reflection of carmax as a whole,3,"Some positives of my store are a consistent work schedule, and mostly pleasant coworkers.
","Carmax from what I’ve heard is a great company to work for. I believe this, but the specific store I work for in Puyallup is a very poor representation of carmax standards.
My store is driven to hit their target. That’s great, but morals and pride in our work is thrown out the window. The cars we produce are NOT quality. Why? Because we’re short staffed. The employees that show up seem to be the ones being reprimanded and suffering. We have a pace time of 22 minutes to clean a car. We are pushed to do it even quicker to hit goal, and are told to pass cars that are not within our standards. We have been in mandatory overtime since the grand opening of this store- since 2017. “Optional” overtime doesn’t really come across as optional. Management is inconsistent in their policies and what they say constantly changes. Nobody wants to be here, the morale is crumbling, all I hear is about how everyone wants to leave. I had high hopes for this store before but not anymore. A main manager held a meeting awhile back for us to discuss issues and change we wanted to see, it boosted morale for about 48 hours but dived back down once it was made obvious that we weren’t being listened to. Nothing brought up has been truly fixed yet, we’ve only gotten excuses or an ineffective step toward change and then the whole idea gets dropped. I understand change takes time, but I’m not seeing any fix to a single issue that was brought up. The work environment is TOXIC. The training is a joke. Everyone is quitting- for good reason- and we aren’t hiring enough to replace them. And those that do get hired, aren’t trained properly and end up leaving soon after. Nobody here from what I feel or have heard others feel, feels respected. Nobody feels respected, listened to, valued, trained, happy, or hope for the company to improve. They don’t feel pride in their work. They don’t feel pride in their company. I used to enjoy working here and my coworkers are great, one of the only reasons I haven’t brought myself to leave yet, but despite them I’m writing a review in hopes that it’ll encourage someone higher up to take a look at the Puyallup location’s production building and reevaluate how it’s being handled.

I worked at CarMax full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
I worked at CarMax for about 5 years. In that time, I was trained to sell cars and ascended to one of the top 3-5 sales people out of 40. I was awarded the yearly Las Vegas trip multiple times and awarded bonuses and recognition. It was good. 

Lots of customers to see. Good sales training. They know what sells cars and give you the tools to succeed.
Cons
In my 5 years there, no one was ever promoted from within. When the sales manager job came open, they outside hired over multiple internal applicants. Service manager, outside hire. General manager, outside hire from best buy. In fact, my store was open since 2008 and no sales consultant was ever promoted.

They never give raises. They say you can give yourself a raise by selling more cars. Pay has only increased $10 per car since 1993. Considering inflation, real wages have declined substantially. 

Eventually I was fired because of one sales manager's petty grudge. I was planning to move on anyway, but its crazy this could happen at a major national company. HR never heard my side of the story and never asked. I am thankful for the investment CarMax made in me, as I was able to get a much better higher paying job in sales based on my experience and achievements there.

Advice to Management
Educate management especially in the Business Office and Service area on how to treat their workers fairly and listen to all the concerns and not play favoritism. Often at times we as workers feel helpless when things are happening that are not appropriate and we speak out and it falls on deaf ears. Also let your workers do their job and stop with the unnecessary micromanaging. It creates a hostile work environment which results in high turnover.

","No incentives to work hard. Raises are non existent, employees who've been at the company for years are making the same as new hires. The only ""thanks"" you get for doing your job to the best of your ability is more word piled onto your load. Absolutely no idle time, if you management sees you standing around for any length of time you'll get in trouble, and when you're working in 90+ degree weather all day 5 minute breaks here and there would be greatly appreciated. Sales associates are impossible to work with. Management always SIdes with them on any issue and is constantly trying to bend the rules in their favor.

I have been working at CarMax full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Good benefits, management willing to accommodate your vacation and leave requests, our opinion counts (sometimes).
Cons
Hiring too many sales consultants competing for the same pot creates a negative work environment and poor morale. Rotating hours don't allow for any regular time off or planning for other activities outside of work. Almost impossible to maintain your president's club status with slower sales and nitpicking customers who waste your time test driving and then buy somewhere else.
Advice to Management
Treat employees, especially commissioned sales people, fairly and respect their time. We spend more time at work than at home with family putting a lot of stress to make money, which is not easy unless you put in more than 50-60 hrs a week.

Thu Apr 04 2019, Manager,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Behind the times,4,"The company has a ton of information available to you. They encourage new team members to “own your development “
","It seems to be a company that a one point in time was very structured and focus on training and development but has since lost sight of the policies that lead to their success. Sales are the only thing g that matter currently. The facilities are generally outdated and the technology is at least 10 years behind the curve. The biggest issue with the “ own your development “ philosophy is that most of the time your superiors are the ones standing in your way.
Advice to Management
Concentrate on following procedures across the board and not cherry picking . You can blame other people all day but ultimately it all falls on senior level management to create an atmosphere that fosters development and growth .

I worked at CarMax part-time for more than a year
Pros
Potential to make lots of money working nights and weekends. Having tools like salesforce, carmax app, and outlook email to keep in touch with your customer it makes it easier to be able to follow up, work remotely so that you can keep in contact and stay on top of customers requests and appointments. The hours of availability for a part time sales consultant is perfect for anyone who needs to balance two jobs or one. A great company offers the ability to self promote yourself based on your performance, company offers company wide training, managers offers feedback and advice and help so that you can succeed in your role of your daily duties. You can come in to work to sell a vehicle on your days off if needed.
Cons
You may need to work extra hours to become successful as a part time sales consultant but that is only a CON if you don't know how to balance your work schedule. You are sometimes at the mercy of your customers time.
Advice to Management
In sales, your only empowered to handle up to a certain level of customer service. When you give your customers great service they turn to you for help, and when you try to include other departments to help out your customer, you are pushed aside instead of partnering with the sales consultant to better understand the customers situation, and offering feedback to the sales consultant and customer about the next steps, which reflects poorly on how customer service is truly handled. This maybe reflected upon one store in particular, but it should be an example to others about how this process needs to change. 

In a company that is all about providing the best customer service, it all about how you handle a customers situation after the sale no matter the issue, the company needs to be able to stand behind their product, employees, and customer. Don't look for the cheapest way out, if there is an issue with the quality control of how many customers are returning a vehicle due to mechanic reasons, there needs to be a discussion or investigate with the manager of that department to resolve or diminish the issue and prevent these issues further. In the end it all comes down to the quality in the product in which you are selling, which also reflects how the sales consultants gets paid which drives more business to the store. My advice to sales managers is backup your sales consultants, they are trying to create the best customer service they can provide but may need to turn to you for help. Help them where you can, go above and beyond your role, don't be afraid to stand up to another manager from another department to have a conversation about whats happening in their departments. Come together and think outside the box on solutions to problems that you see within your department, or other departments.
