Wed Feb 10 2021, Account Executive,"Kansas City, MO",Current Employee ,Family focused company which rewards hard work and integrity,0,"Aflac is transforming itself into an ancillary insurance carrier. It started out as a voluntary benefits or worksite carrier in the 1950's and it the past 6 years, it has expanded to work in the insurance broker community, bought Zurich's group life, disability and absence management company. Aflac also purchased Argus' dental and vision business. Aflac has listened to it's brokers and customers and is consistently improving its everyday Customer Service and billing. Aflac hasn't forgotten where it came from which is a company that perfected the enrollment process. Insurance is not easy for the lay person to understand and one on one enrollment a huge asset for covered individual and group policyholders. Aflac will enroll other carrier's products if needed including medical and all other benefit offerings. Aflac treats its employees like family. Lastly, Aflac will always side of behalf of its participants when it comes to processing claims. If there is way to pay benefits to our customers, we do and are committed to putting the customer first.
","Aflac is not different from other companies which were established many decades ago. It is conservative and does not make systematic changes quickly. However, this is the way that Aflac has remained financially sound during this pandemic. It watches the bottom line very carefully so it can always meet it financial commitment to policyholders and investors.
Advice to Management
Stay on course and the future is bright. It is critical to continue to fine tune how our operations treat our customers that touch them the most. Customer Service and Billing improvements must remain a focus.

","The company is more concerned for its shareholders. Therefore the vision is to throw things on the wall to see if they stick. With the good leaders, you also meet ones that have no business in the their roles. Aflac wants you to constantly recruit because in theory, new recruits means new accounts. Those recruits do not always stay because the are given a misconception about how pay really is and management is left to start all over with another recruit(s) AND likely a client that has not been serviced. On paper the job looks good- in reality- you are only building Aflac and not necessarily your own business.
Advice to Management
Stop recruiting a heartbeat that passes a test (with resources given by leaders of Aflac) just so they can saturate the market and likely quit.

I have been working at Aflac full-time for more than a year
Pros
They give you the ability to get paid your worth and to work when you want and with who you want. Right out of college, I was looking at careers that were going to pay me $30-40k when I just spent $50k+ on my education...that wasn't going to cut it. I always work hard, no matter what my position or title, so I want to be compensated that way. This company gave me the ability to be compensated fairly based on my work ethic. I also have had several opportunities to grow within the company and move into leadership. This company has changed my life and I wouldn't do anything different if I could.
Cons
The only con would be that I wish there were more opportunities to learn from agents nationwide on a more frequent basis.

No special equipment needed. Aflac now uses a cloud based software for enrolling that can be accessed anywhere at anytime from any device, even your smart phone. 

Flex Schedule-Allows for work-life balance. You get out what you put in. As an overachiever I was always limited to my salary regardless of how hard I worked. Aflac has helped me soar. I finally have an income that's based on my effort. 

Mothers/Fathers hours available - Allows you to be at your kids games and at the bus stop to greet your children when they get home.
A fortune 500 company with cutting edge web based, classroom and field training. 

Unlimited opportunity-With penetration levels below 3% in our market (due to a later roll out) paired with our brand recognition there is an enormous amount of income potential. 

Renewal income for the life of the policy. I am still getting paid on policies I wrote 10 years ago. 

Huge year 1 and year 2 bonuses awarded just by doing your job. These are easy to attain for even an average producer. 

You can win several amazing trips each year. Get your passport ready. 
Stocks after 1 year
","Must be comfortable with rejection. The no's lead us to our yes's. I have met a few rude employers but I have also met friends for life. Must be thick skinned.

","As an insurance producer you are responsible for finding all of your own business entirely. It's B2B soliciting and cold calling - 150 cold calls per appointment, 40 doors walked through per appointment are the statistics. If you can get one appointment per day then you'll do great, but you MUST have a drive to succeed and a passion for sales. If you can't manage yourself, and can't make one appointment per day then you will fail, and it is 100% commission as a 1099 employee. No benefits. Either you can enjoy B2B sales and soliciting or you can't, there is no in between with the job. If you can't, then you won't make money. If you're on the fence and need a guaranteed paycheck then find a W-2 position elsewhere. I have it a shot because I liked the idea, I liked the idea of being my own boss. I just couldn't bring myself to ever cold call, I hated it once I started trying it, and door to door was better but I just didn't have the drive for it. Just know what you're getting in to.

Feedback I've had from a business owner who used to have aflac: it was impossible to get a hold of the rep and there was no support, it made it seem like all we cared about was the initial money. I think you'd do much better off having dedicated W-2 account servicers, who specialize in account retention. I know a lot of that goes to the more seasoned sales producers, but it's very hard to get a new producer started and keep them onboard long enough to get to that point, meanwhile accounts fall off the books.

Pros
You choose your own hours and can make a nice career out of Aflac.

The commission structure is good if you plan on staying with Aflac for the long term.

The training is fantastic. They really can make a good salesperson out of anybody with the heart to do it. 

Coworkers are super fun people. Every aflac event is a blast
Cons
You WILL be broke for the first year regardless how hard you work. 

No customer has ever been glad to see me in the 6 months i've been doing it. They're usually nice and all, but the fact that everybody just wants you up leave when they realize what you're up to is disheartening.

Pros
This will depend on who your coordinator is, but in general the coordinators take a genuine interest in your success.
Cons
Where to start... 

-Old ineffective sales tool
-CCLM is a pain to properly manage and plan
-Training's are long and drawn out and you get nothing from them
-They throw you to the wolves after week one with no real preparation
-Way too much cold calling, system does show companies on Do Not Call or out of business, actual program support is few and far between.
- Be prepared to hear no, get cussed out by ""leads"", and if you live in a relatively low income place... good luck. 
-They give you an illusion of ""owning your own business"", but in reality, not even close.
Advice to Management
Have a more efficient CCLM, Define a territory so we aren't on top of each other, HELP new associates, quit with the ""Benefits Consultant"", ""Business Consultant"" titles in job searches and be honest. 

You have a great product, but you do not give us tools to even feel confident in what we are selling. You mislead constantly. Stipend new associates while they go through training's early so they can properly know what you offer before they start soliciting business. I struggle every day to work for you.

Wed Aug 01 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Good, Bad and Ugly",12,"Many products are actually helpful and do the customer justice.
","Hierarchy plays games with accounts constantly. Now, I KNOW this isn't just my region but I also know that there are definitely regions that have it really good. These other regions have an excellent team and many companies to work with and accounts to choose from as well as great training resources. I just so happened to get stuck with one of the bad ones but moving isn't an option for me at this point. There was no training for me. I was new to the insurance world and sales so I was not only flying solo but totally lost with virtually no direction. There was a week long class I took that was good. I liked the instructor as well as the fellow new agents. But from what I have learned over time is it's all about knowing the right people and having the right team. My area is small and dominated by a couple of local agents who have literally lived here their whole lives and know everyone and their mom, cousin and sister's brother's friend.....they hold all the large accounts and several smaller accounts. They never service these accounts but when district brings new agents in it is based on the premise and promise that you will help service these accounts in exchange for taking over the book of business when the agents retire. This is utter bs. There have been a minimum of 6 agents, other than myself, who were all told the same thing. These accounts weren't ""serviced"" according to Aflac because no new business had been written for 6 mo, 12 mo, 24 mo....or whatever. When I called, and all the following 6 + agents called after me over the last year to year and a half the client always said they were happy with what they had and were not interested in being contacted any further. Many were upset by how often they were contacted. And after all the hours of work to help people with claims or getting yelled at for being the 100th agent to call on them you literally get no pay. And the agents ""due to retire soon"" have NO intention of leaving the game for many years to come. Most of the business around here is taken by these agents and the few that aren't have heard from Aflac so many times they threaten you or cuss you out. There were some companies that I got through to and had spoken with a client to set up an enrollment or presentation only to have another agent sweep in and take it from me because they called as well. The customer assumes Aflac agents all come from the same place and it doesn't matter who they contact or go with for business. They do not realize it is based on individual effort. I have had quite a few accounts taken from me or someone else has ""serviced"" one of my accounts in hopes of getting more business under their own name through my contact. I have had accounts ""given"" to me only to learn later after I serviced it and helped with claims that it was given to someone else. The claims department is difficult to deal with as well. I have YET to see a one day pay claim, though this is their motto. I have done well over 20 claims with nothing but road blocks and issues and lots of follow ups needed. It is NOT an easy process for myself or the client. They also expect you to go to seminars and meetings and updates weekly, sometimes 3-4 times a week, many requiring out of town travel (no compensation)- this became a full-time portion of the job and I had to eventually start telling them no, I wouldn't do it. I had started off with putting many hours in to calling, door knocking and speaking with friends and family with little to no results. My area has been saturated with Aflac and it is not easy. If you aren't part of the ""good ol' boys club"" you won't make it here. The turn over rate is high due to this issue and realization alone. I have heard other agents who work in other areas rave about the support they receive, the team they work with, the great quantities of accounts and prospects etc etc. I have no doubt that in certain areas this would be a great job with decent if not excellent pay, as for me in my area- not so. Aflac also does not have a checks and balances system. They say they do. That if you note here in this system, then update the other system, then notate in yet ANOTHER system you will cover your bases and people shouldn't touch your accounts or accounts you've serviced. Yet I went through the pain staking process of doing this each week, sometimes taking hours to complete because of the many calls and visits I made, but somehow no one ever knew. When I looked in the different systems there were never any updates showing the account being serviced or who I had talked with and what was said. Then I'd have people calling me asking why they were getting calls from other agents when they had just spoken with me.....literally stepping all over each other but there was never any evidence. Why? That's what entering all the information in to 2-3 different systems was designed for....

Thu Feb 15 2018, Marketing Analyst,,Current Employee ,Seasoned Analyst,8,"I was part of the group that had the opportunity to keep the pension (which is the main reason I stay, i would have to literally get paid close to 100k a year, have great benefits, and even up my 401k another 12-15 percent just to make it worth it), profit sharing bonus isnt promised but a huge plus, 401k match up to 4%, benefits, PTO that builds by one day (once tenured at 5 years till 15th year, so over 200 plus hours of paid time off). When you hear of google and their amenities and even cafe it makes our cafes look like highway robbery. You pay a premium to eat healthy here. The town of Columbus is a nice area to raise a family, not a big city feel but just enough not to feel like small country town. Most millennial adults and generations forward hate the town but those establishing a family see the reasoning to stay if they are in a professional role and settling down.
","Promotions usually mean you will be brought in at the bottom of your pay scale and it seems that bracket can range up to 20-35k as you move into analyst and management roles. I feel the pay is quite low for the level of work considering the same job pays almost 15-20k more in larger cities. I have plenty of friends that left for Anthem/BCBS/Unum etc because of this....However, if you make it a career being at the professional analyst level, such as a SR analyst or Consultant (which is usually an MC1-MC2 range) you can achieve close to a six figure income. Higher levels of management have over a 130k cap. The most difficult part of this is waiting for people to leave the company through attrition or just because of a better opportunity. If you are in the GA side, property taxes suck, however in Phenix CIty AL they are about 1/4th. If you aren't above 75k aftertax dollars with kids this can be a rough town to swing because of expense, being single you can maybe get by making 35-40k but you will live by your means.

Thu Dec 28 2017, Aflac Producer,"Lehi, UT",Former Employee ,"For those unhappy ""Interns"" with negative reviews",22,"As a company, Aflac is stelar and a good place for a very profitable career. I've had an Accident Policy for several years, it's been a life-saver many times (broken tooth, sprained wrist, broken bone in hand, bulging disc in neck, crushed foot, and the list goes on....we received money on every injury). As with most companies in the insurance business, it does take time to build your pipeline. The primary goal as an employee is to develop a stream of residual income. This takes time and effort and a good Trainer. Most people tend to burn out after a few months of hard work (cold calls and follow-up, etc). It's hard work! But once you see that monthly residual check (and continue to grow it), life can be pretty good. They don't cover the costs for getting licensed, but you have to have some skin in the game...right? As for all of the unhappy ""interns"".....it makes perfect sense, this is a longer term career move and working for a few months can be discouraging. If you are willing to work hard and work smart, Aflac can be very lucrative.
","Cons....? Having patience during the first year or two isn't easy. There aren't any healthcare benefits (it's a 1099 job). You do get to deduct almost everything from your taxes. The only other ""Con"" could be the training, make sure you attend every session and learn from the best.

All levels of executive leadership (President, CEO, EVPs, SVPs, etc.) foster an environment of fear and retaliation against those that don't conform. If you don't ""drink the kool-aid"" and bow down to the duck, you can't succeed here. Aflac is NOT an ethical company. Yes, they throw crumbs to the employees every May with employee appreciation week. But the pay for the rest of the year is minimal. Sadly, they've been successful so far at convincing employees that EAW proves that the company values them. In fact, the company offers minimal salary increases and only ""favorites"" get promoted. In addition to pay that is not competitive in the industry, you are expected to cover up when the company does something unethical or illegal. Yes, ILLEGAL. The company has been found in violation of laws in many states and has been fined heavily. But that hasn't discouraged the company.

Although you need a car for this job, your trunk essentially becomes your travelling office, instead of sitting at a desk all day. Although you pay 100% of your gas and client meetings/ lunch/ prizes expenses up front, these are all tax deductible each year. Weekly contests where each representative can win prizes or small amounts of money.
","Only paid commission, need to have enough money up front for insurance license course and test. Also need to personally purchase all software and materials for client presentations. Need to attend weekly meetings from 8am to 5pm at regional office, unpaid. Takes a while to establish client base. Eventually quit because after I expanded my client base for nearly two years, my inmediate manager sought me as a partner and wanted to split commissions (the only way you get paid) and only give me 30%. She seriously wanted to keep 70%! Also, she wanted me as a partner so badly because I speak Spanish and she doesn't. I was so insulted I just never went back again, as I already had a night job as well. By the way, you will need a second job/form of income or substantial savings to start this job.

I was so excited to start seeing how much money I was able to potentially make. My first day of training I hated it but i thought that it was completely new and i had to get used to it so i stuck with it. I was told by a few people that i shouldn't be doing any work from home unless it was putting brochures together, collecting info regarding appointments or making up my schedule for the upcoming week. That was something that was extremely contradicting from my 3 interviews that advertised this as a 'work from home' job. I stuck with it and continued walking into door after door everyday and i hated it. I was able to make appointments but i eventually quit because i couldn't stand the cold calling, not to mention it was very cold outside. I gave Aflac 3 stars because their training was awesome and it was a great experience. Everyone was so helpful but I do however wish that the job was advertised the proper way or I would have never tried it in the first place. Best of luck to anyone willing to give it a try!

I worked at Aflac full-time for more than a year
Pros
I learned what a Pyramid Scheme was and how they were implemented in every sales position on Wall Street, especially in insurance
Cons
No base pay, all commission. I was lied to in my interview about being able to pay my expenses solely on commission, I was lied to about the role I was applying for. I made 350 Cold Calls a day to try to get accounts for the managers. The turnover rate for employees was 80%, do not let insurance people scam you into sales. It is very hard to make it in this industry and they target young desperate people who just want to say they ""work on wall street""
Advice to Management
Need to change tactics for recruiting. I figured out the scheme almost immediately and a lot of the young people I worked with figure it out very early on as well.

Advice to Management
Management never changes. Once a person is there, they never leave. As there are limited ""leadership"" positions, it's quite unfair that others who are superstars in their positions hit the glass ceiling because of tenured people who are rotting in their leadership positions and should be re-evaluated for effectiveness rather than passed over because of their time served...

Mon Jul 18 2016, Sales Associate,"Orlando, FL",Current Employee ,Associate on the edge,18,"*I've seen some reviews about terrible District or Regional Sales Coordinators (essentially bosses right above you) but I've had a wonderful experience with both of mine. They do seem to genuinely want their agents to succeed and are always willing to help you, within their power. 
*The job has endless possibilities for income - once you can get yourself off the ground. After the first 2+ years you're not just getting commissions but return commissions on renewals and accounts you already had, plus some stock, etc. 
*Flexibility. Your time is yours, so if you're out cold calling - you're working towards making your own money - but you don't have to report to anyone. Not a 9-5 job unless you're disciplined and make it so. No boss to report to or tell you how to do your job. Room for creativity and growth in position and money is based on performance - not who you know necessarily. How hard you work = how far you get
*Training. i thought the training sessions and content were very useful though I wish they prepared agents better for the reality of selling
*Contests. Aflac constantly has sales contests for all expense paid trips. They're wonderful and definitely achievable - you just have to work for them
*Products. I didn't know anything about Aflac before I started working for them but now that I really know what it does I truly believe in the products and think they genuinely help people. They're very affordable, and as an agent (hopefully) selling something you do believe in should make the job easier
","*Discipline Discipline Discipline. I'm just out of college and I worked really hard but there's never been a job I've had where I had to give so much of my self. Con of not having a boss, office, 9-5, clocking in, etc. is that everything you do YOU have to get yourself to do. There's also a lot of plates spinning at once since you're trying to work 100 'potential' accounts at the same time. Requires immense organization. I love being organized yet this job has pushed me to new limits
*Privilege based starting. We spout the statistic all the time about how 80% of Americans don't have more than $1,000 in a savings account - meanwhile in Aflac you're not seeing a check until you close an account. You NEED to have the money set aside to cover living expenses while your'e starting off. The idea is a big pay-in for big pay-out later. I also heard young is better for this business, for exactly that reason, but being young I don't have that kind of money squirreled away and I'm working a second job to make ends meet - but it's emotionally exhausting to be doing both honestly.
*Rejection and independence. Honestly, even cold calling, most people are nice, but you will get those faces who have already had 6 agents in their doors the last week and will throw you out the door. You have to be ready for this and let it roll of your back. If you can't you probably shouldn't be doing this job. You also need to be able to deal with being by yourself. You have a District team and leaders - but your business is yours and sharing business means sharing commission if you're working with others. I love my team but I only see them about 1-2 times a week for meetings
Advice to Management
*Base salary to stop at 1st year end. I know people talk about having a base salary for this job - and maybe it would discourage people from working harder - but the job is literally undoable for someone who's young or already struggling - but does want to succeed in the long run. It's like instead of a $200 buy in its your gas, rent, time, bills, and entire personal network until you can get the snowball rolling. Maybe stop the base salary once someone has 1 even 3 accounts in their name - but at the start it's just exhausting and more money is going in than coming out for quite a while.
*Let people know what they're in for. Yes they tell you it will be hard. But I wish they would stress that more. if you have a part-time job, maybe you shouldn't quit to do this til you're actually settled cause the part-time job is what's paying my bills right now, generally. The sales pitch you get to be an agent is pretty flowery, it should be a bit more realistic if they want turnover to be lower. Higher ups are happy and love their jobs cause they've already been through the storm of their first years but that's hard to process for new agents who are just being told about the endless wealth and good doing this job provides

Not Worth It AT ALL.,8,"You learn about how companies like Aflac take advantage and pull in people that seem desperate for a job or are naive and try their best to not tell potential recruits about the nature of the job (cold calling, no base salary, out of pocket expenses, etc.). 

You learn how to spot jobs like this, and to not go for them.
","- Can get horrible DSC, was told I would get reimbursed for my license exam - wasn't given the reimbursement after passing the exam . Felt horribly cheated.
- It's a massive scheme. You are treated like a machine, or a number, rather than an employee.
- They'll tell you about how successful employees get great benefits and vacations and earn millions of dollars, what they don't tell you is about the VAST majority - how many current and former employees are humiliated and insulted. This is not worth it even if you have 0 experience in anything. It will only pull you down some more. 
- Only way this works is if :
* you are willing to invest money out of your own pocket
* you are willing to earn negative income for an unknown duration (depending on how many ridiculous hours you put in)
* during that negative income duration, you are willing to get rejected and insulted a million times by people you call (because Aflac has a terrible reputation), and on top of that, you're willing to lose your soul and become a robot. 
* you're willing to be potentially cheated by a co-worker

If you're willing to go through all that, then yes go for it - you have a chance.

You can tell that I certainly had a horrible experience here. People might read this and say ""oh well you have to work hard to actually get something out of it"". Yes, that's correct, you do have to work hard - ""hard"" being a very subjective term. This is not the kind of ""hard"" that garbage can collectors have to go through, not the kind of ""hard"" that outdoor construction workers go through on a 100+ degree weather day, not the kind of ""hard"" that janitors have to go through wiping the dirtiest bathrooms on the face of the earth. All these jobs deserve respect. But this job... no. You will have no respect, you will have to work so hard that your mind crumbles into bits, your arms become numb, and your soul becomes completely empty. You will have to cheat and trick so many people in order to become successful - only a complete trashbag will have the heart to do this.

 I would not wish this job on my greatest enemy and I hope that anyone who reads this STAYS AWAY no matter how desperate they are. You deserve so much better.

","I was treated terribly while I was at Aflac. I received very little training and then was thrown straight in to cold calling to get sales appointments. I was lucky that I had previous calling experience, so I didn't do too badly; however the compensation was solely commission and despite my many appointments, I didn't get paid for my work until after the internship had ended. I had to work at my internship full time and work at a restaurant on the weekends just so that I could pay for gas. Aflac does not give you any compensation for business expenses. I paid for all of my own gas, tolls, and stamps and I had to use my own cell phone when calling businesses. I was also misled about the compensation system. I was under the impression that I was a W2 employee, when in fact I was a 1099 employee. At the age of 19, I ended up owing the government over $800 in taxes. Had I known this was a possibility, I would have never taking the job. WORST of all was what happened after my internship had ended. Aflac has a policy that requires employees to give back their commission if people cancel their accounts before a year has gone by. I was NEVER informed of this and over a year after I left the company I got a statement saying that I owed the company $300 with absolutely no explanation as to why I was being charged. I called over and over again until I finally found someone who even knew what the charge was for. I was treated like I was an idiot and was not taken seriously by anyone even after I had explained the situation. I did not have the $300 at the time and after months of trying to get the charge reduced or taken away, I finally gave up and borrowed the money from my parents. I contacted the Aflac ethics department explaining what had happened and how unfairly I had been treated and I never got a response. This was by far the worst job I've ever had. It was very stressful while I was there and continued to be more than a year after I left.

","With all that being said, there are a lot of things that I wished they had informed us on. They focus on getting you new accounts and making money.

","The challenges I faced were the lack of organization when it comes to support of the agent, sure there is information handed out and the meetings are great but one on one assistance is very little. One would be assigned to a District Coordinator. The responsibility of the DSC is to help the new agent in the field, coaching the agent for success. The DSC is suppose to assist the agent in getting 2-5 accounts and over a course of 5 weeks of training, the agent is released to run his/her own business. The DSC is available at anytime the agent needs him/her... This is not the case with this office.. Everyone has their own agenda and only has time for the new agent if they have a strong lead that the agent has acquired on their own. I spent my last on becoming apart of this reputable team and have been pushed aside to the point that I had to speak with regional for assist and he has done the same.. Shocked and disappointed, I had to find other means of income.

","While I truly believe AFLAC has a great product, the way they go about utilizing their sales associates certainly does not adhere to their reputation. They are one of the most ethical insurance companies in the world... except for how they treat new associates. I would liken it to the way the British used arrows during Medieval battles. They just spray as many out there as they can and see which ones hit. They send you to ""sales school"" where you go over the ""sales lines"" and how to respond to certain rebuttals by employers you are trying to get appointment with. One in particular they seem to focus on is ""You are the (insert number) AFLAC agent this week."" What they didn't tell you is that you would sometimes walk into a business and hear ""You are the 5th AFLAC agent TODAY."" Talk about saturation! Unless you personally know business owners or are a sorcerer of a sales person, don't even waste your time. Your up front cost will be in the range of $1000 considering State licensing, business attire, business cards, sales materials, gas, vehicle maintenance, etc... I was in the negative when I left. Yes, I LOST money working for AFLAC. Again, I have absolutely nothing against the product. I think it is an amazing product but the means by which they go about selling it left a bad taste for me.
Advice to Management
BE HONEST! Don't sugar coat the job just to get people in. This is why you have such enormous turnover. You tell people about all these opportunities to make huge money and go on all these fantastic trips but you don't tell them up front what it will take to make it. Tell them the REAL failure rate of the job. Don't tell them how it was 20 years ago BEFORE the market was saturated with agents. Tell them how it is NOW. Also, maybe don't use agents like British arrows. Like another reviewer said, personality tests, criteria for getting into the company, these things would help limit turnover and also not waste the time and money of the potiential associate.

Sun Oct 04 2015,Anonymous,"Santa Monica, CA",Current Employee ,Opportunities everywhere,3,"I put thousands of dollars and years of time striving to get hired for some stable $60K entry level salary from whatever insurance company. 

For me, choosing Aflac particularly is, without a doubt, worth more than $60K a year. The insurance marketplace is gaining new forms of competition, and Aflac has all the resources to lead and set the bar on what will become the standard. 
Not only does Aflac have the depth & history, but also Aflac straight up has been the most ethical insurance company for 9 years straight! I feel incredibly lucky to represent such ethical company.

-Ethical
-Very fulfilling life, culture is great! Everyone needs everyone else to succeed.
-Fair commission, Residuals for life

","There are quite a few here...if you get into a region where ppl don't share accounts, you WILL NOT MAKE AN INCOME for probably 4-5 months. You will spend much more financially to establish yourself. I make about 500 phone calls per week and it is very emotionally and physically taxing. Sure, there are the super huge successes that you hear about in your region, but those are few and far between. The average person will scrape by their first few years on saved money from other jobs. 
The training is very hit and miss depending on who your mentor is and where you are located.
There is only really a work life balance if you choose not to work....you own your own business only in theory. AFLAC can remove your contract with them at any time they choose. 
**What they won't tell you about your work is that like all business owners, you really are at the mercy and time of other business owners. You can begin to feel desperate or just general apathy towards regular human conditions...sometimes I think that even if you were making tons of $$ doing this it would not be worth it...

There has to be some more ways for brand new associates to earn more of an income.

","Your experience and success can have a lot to do with the district coordinators.

Wed Oct 21 2015, Insurance Agent,"Little Rock, AR",Former Employee ,Indepedent insurance agent is really outside B2B sales,1,"Excellent products, independence, making your own schedule, potential to help others at difficult times in their lives, potential residual income, potential trips of a lifetime, on-going training at the click of a mouse, discounts on really great income protection, having an iconic mascot with great name recognition (the Duck). Great opportunity for anyone regardless of education; depending on the requirements of the state you live in, you typically can start at just 18 years of age with a H.S. Diploma. Can launch an entire career from this opportunity.
","Success depends entirely on you, as well as on the group you sign up with. You are not really working for Aflac Corporate unless you are willing to relocate to Columbus, GA. You get help offered to you, but you are ultimately an independent agent. If you don't take rejection well, or are not a natural salesperson, you probably won't make money. Compensation is entirely 100% commission only. I made appointments for my ""closer"" trainer, and even he could not close the accounts. After so many weeks or months of you not closing accounts, your trainer will refocus their attention onto new recruits. At that point you are pretty much on your own, unless you have tricky a presentation or a big enrollment. Gas and transportation is up to you, your schedule is up to you, how many businesses and what type of business you prospect? All is up to you. Also taxes, retirement, personal health and life insurance, social security . . .all of those things will ultimately be up to you. If you are not prepared for that, the title ""independent sales agent"" may not be for you. And you have to take a state exam and pass it in order to successfully be an agent, which will require time, focus, and study. Not as hard as the real estate exam in most states (so I am told), but still somewhat intense.
Advice to Management
Treat people like adults and let them know up front the cons, as well as the pros, of a career as an independent agent. Don't try to sparkle people by only mentioning the potential residual income and exotic trips. And use what other companies use to weed out candidates for which this opportunity is not a good fit, personality tests and/or use a list of qualities of a successful agent in the job description. Finally, don't lie to people about it being a family atmosphere when its really all about the bottom line. Keep it real in the beginning.

","Co Workers? Might as well not have any. You don't leave your desk, except lunch and breaks. This is 100% phone job. You are paid just to get yelled about about people's claims not being paid or paid on time. They have a very specific way they want you to do the call, and if you don't you get coached on it constantly. They give you PTO after 90 days, but good luck using it. you get 40 hours unscheduled PTO. The remainder must all be scheduled. And it's a rolling year. SO even though you have PTO, if you didn't plan on being sick after you used the unscheduled....you will be written up. There is no break on the phone. EVER. Always call after call, always in queue. Advancement opportunities are not likely. You would have to be there for years before one came open, and chances are someone has been there for longer and will be considered.

Many of the veteran agents available to me at the time that I worked for the office were constantly involved in personal issues, interoffice relationships, and personal business obligations; which left me in limbo and clueless to what I needed to be doing on a day to day when trying to build and service my own clientele. A lot of broken promises during my experience also. Although, I will say there were other agents that came in at various points that had a different experiences and were quite successful. At some points I wondered if they were slightly uncomfortable with working with individuals of other ethnicities.

","I went to an Aflac training meeting (closest one from the greater Phila area was almost in Baltimore) and was promptly met by a flashy upper sales coordinator trying to impress you with how much hair gel he can afford to use. His advise was on par, but it was clear half the interviewees were less than competent but he was giving them the same 'you can make X amount of money next month' speech. It helps to have a good back office; without a good district sales coordinator right above you it's hard to get started. Most people fail with Aflac, but those who succeed seem to have good things to say about it.

","We are tied to a phone all day, no room for growth and micro-managed on everything you do. Most companies give you two weeks vacation, two weeks sick pay and option to use unpaid time for emergencies. At Aflac you get about 13 days off a year (not including holidays which is a plus) and if an emergency comes up and you go over those days or you use up your 40 hours of unscheduled PTO you will get written up and are at risk for termination. I have seen alot of good people get fired because of going over their days. Not a good company to work for if you have children because you basically have to plan on when they will get sick and having your time approved to be out with them. No room for growth. It seems that getting promotions is based on ""It's not what you know, but who you know."" Some of the supervisors help their favorites that have not been there long get the promotions and raises while the ones that really deserve it and have been there for years stay in the same position. Also you have Supervisors that should not be a Supervisor. Most of the Supervisors are Awesome but there are one or two that really do not know how to motivate their team and do not care. The stress level is very high.
Advice to Management
Please make sure that the Supervisor's are being fair and consistant. If you see that a person has been at Aflac for years and is still in the same position look into why. If you notice that an employee is using alot more AUX or all of sudden they are being written up when you know that they use to be on top of things, then try to find out why instead of punishing them. It could be that they are getting burnt out, overlooked and feeling like they are never getting anywhere. Alot of employees are going through this and do not want to say anything for fear that it will make them look like they are causing problems. If you have an employee that has been there for years and they do a good job and know what they are doing but stay stuck in the same position year after year then you are at risk for loosing a valuable employee. For one, the Employee gets bored after a few years of doing the same thing day after day and needs something more challenging. They get stressed and frustrated especially when they see others who have less experience and knowledge getting promotions, especially when the promotions are few and far between. Basically, look out for your Veteran Employees. They have vast knowlede of your company and want to help you succeed but if they are not excelling and exceeding then they will end up loosing interest and will either end up getting fired due to burnout and stress or end up going elsewhere where they can get the promotions and recognition and you will have lost a valuable asset. Sometimes it is not all about numbers.

Sun Nov 08 2009,N/A,"Los Angeles, CA"," in Los Angeles, CA",Agent Recruiting Finally Hits oversaturation,5,"Brand recognition, marketshare, claims payment ratios.
","Aflac Veteran of over 10 years. Have held several positions starting with Associate. Major management and strategy changes in 2009 and projected for 2010 have and will continue to cause serious challenges to Brand and therefore sales. 

Oversaturation in recruiting new agents has finally become the primary negative to group account prospects. Aflac has addressed this over the last 10 years as a constant in the marketplace, however the issue of excessive contact of prospects by an overly agressive field force has become a very bad and seemingly permanent perception amongst Aflac targeted companies. It has become the primary reason companies who do not offer Aflac WILL NOT OFFER AFLAC.

Internal changes by Aflac Headquarters scheduled for 2010 limiting access to larger companies unless through the new Aflac Broker V.P.'s will kill your ability to ""elephant hunt"". If that is your goal, do not interview with this company. It will not happen.

These changes are the result of changes in Senior level management, and in State office management throughout the company. In addition, various executives and State Sales managers have either pled guilty to tax fraud or are under current investigation by I.R.S. and various State departments of insurance.
