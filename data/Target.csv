Target seems able to retain/keep high quality staff members for TL positions. We are asked to do reasonable amounts of work at each shift and scheduling is flexible. I do this job as a second job and I love being able to work as little as 4 hours some weeks. The store is kept clean so that we have a pleasant work environment. My store has a diverse customer base and I like working with a lot of people. We aren’t pressured to buy clothing and accessories from the store to “model” it as some retail jobs expect. The staff discount is better than some other retail jobs.
","More could have been done to protect employees from covid (such as an outdoor dining space for breaks that’s sheltered from rain, and training/culture of keeping 6ft distance even when masked). At times hours are limited so you need to hustle to get everything done or leave things incomplete, but if you stay focused it’s not too much work. For workers needing a lot of hours, this might not be the best job.

","There are high expectations placed on you that oftentimes you simply cannot meet. For a long time I thought I was a complete failure but it turns out that every one of my coworkers felt that they were not getting enough done in the time they had either. I even got employee of the month but still felt that I wasn't meeting expectations or completing tasks quickly enough. Hours are completely variable. Sometimes you're scheduled for 30 hours a week, sometimes it's 8 hours a week. Out of your control. Additionally, there is little room for advancement.

Advice to Management
Identify high performing individuals and talk to them about advancement opportunities rather than waiting for them to come to you. I know its not as realistic in retail, but it would be nice if the company wanted to keep great employees for the long haul and wanted to compensate them to make a long-time career with Target. High performers will always leave for better paying 'real' jobs. I love my store and team and would consider staying but I can't realistically do that on $15 an hour which is just the way retail will always be I suppose.

- Extremely friendly management, HR people, co-workers, and usually customers
- Had a literal sheet of paper, daily, that had the tasks I was to complete that day. We were the only department, that I knew of, that had a sheet of paper with daily tasks ,written by department lead, pinned to a bulletin board right next to the timeclock. Made it very easy to plan ahead and know what the most difficult tasks were that day (so you can do them early and get them over with instead of letting them linger). Wish more jobs didn this.
","- This has happened at multiple jobs in grocery, not just this Target... make sure that the person training you is extremely thorough in their explanations of everyday tasks, any devices or tools that you will encounter in any common or semi-rare situation, etc... After all, that will be what almost all of your time will be spent doing for ~160+ hours a month if you're full time. Ask to watch the first day or two and ask any question you have or have them explain any and all reasoning for their actions. If you can't watch, ask them to show you the end result of a properly done job that you will one day be doing as well. My co-worker was a teenager who was really nice and kind, but he didn't exactly explain everything down to the last detail or he would give out too much information to process too quickly. Not his fault, he's no teacher. It's on you if you don't ask the right questions to be fully prepared to do a good job.

Advice to Management
To the whole corporation: pay more attention to your team members and listen to/ask us for suggestions on what should be done in situations because the stuff you put into place always caused more harm than good. If you're not actually working the job you have no idea what is actually going on and that's okay! but you should reach out to those who do work the jobs before making changes.

I believe that this is a problem that has to come down to corporate that the store needs to be allocated more hours to be able to proper staff for the day. Otherwise we are stuck with a messy store that is hardly organized and makes everyones job more stressful when there is a call out or emergency where someone can not be present at work. It makes things so much harder and more complicated on the team.

I have been working at Target full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Target is wonderful company that has really brought in modernization into its stores. They work well with your lifestyle so scheduling is easy. There are health and dental insurance benefits. The store is very diverse and inclusive!
If there is a specific department in the store you are interested in, your team lead may help you learn to be a DBO (dedicated business owner) like for beauty or tech! 
You learn a lot of logistics of target through that and take on a load of responsibility as well.
Cons
The downside is in most cases, a promotion is done through transferring to other targets in order to grow. Some do promote with in but it’s not as common.

Pros
Leads/managers will thank employees for their work often; putting in the extra effort wont go unnoticed.
Cons
You can get into trouble for little things pretty easily and you don't get much training by managers. You have to figure things out yourself or ask co-workers leaving you kind of clueless and set up to get in trouble for something done wrong. Also, your only allowed to use your discount through cash, gift card, or a red card (not directly through credit/debit) as a way to get employees to sign up for a red card.

Advice to Management
At least while I was there, schedules weren't always checked over by a human being and a lot of people would come in to start at the same time making breaks at least partially overlap. We were scolded for overlapping breaks but scolded for hitting compliance which would have happened otherwise but we were not generally given the opportunity to explain that. Therefore my advice would be to always have schedules manually checked over and confirmed. Also during my time there, the thing I got the most criticism for from guests was how hard the red cards were pushed during each visit.

But once you start realizing you want something more, you start realizing they only care about who they like.
","It's kind of a corrupted environment but the pay is good. Just do your job and go home. Ever since the pay raise they expect the impossible out of you while they walk around and do nothing. It makes hard workers quit and want to quit, which I will be. The minimum raise wage is what we deserve, not a reason to make us work beyond reason. The TIMES they PLACE on THE WORKLOAD is unbelievably ridiculous. They make it seem you are a robot and it takes 1 minute for everyone, no matter how big the box, how much is in the box, no matter the packaging and how hard it is to open and how protected the item is that makes it difficult to open. 1 minute is for every box no matter what area you are in. I could go on. It's ridiculous. ALSO you have to constantly search for hours. I guess that's juist retail but it's sad they brag that they raised the minimum to 15 an hour and cut everyones hours so that they can't get benefits. A lot of older people work here and need that.

Mostly female staff (which is actually mildly depressing when you think about it too much)
Minimal work
","Disorganized: I did not feel adequately trained. I had only one shift where I was shown how to do everything. Products were kept behind the bar, in the kitchen, in a closet next to the kitchen, and in the stockroom. Where is the product you need? Who knows!
Dishonest: Management lied to me more often than I could count for the month I worked there. Most were little white lies ""he pursued other opportunities"" meant he left during his lunch and never came back type thing. But more bafflingly I applied for a nonseasonal position only to be offered a seasonal job. When I called back to turn the work down I was told I definitely was not seasonal it was just for ""paperwork"" reasons. Cut to a month later and my manager is offering me a permanent position. Shes also asking me to lie and say I wasnt offered permanent work so I dont ""hurt the other seasonal workers feelings."" I also asked in the interview which shifts I would be expected to work and was promised at least one open, one mid, and one close per week. I only ever worked closes though even at peak hours. So, get absolutely everything in writing.

Convoluted full-time process: I was told first that it was not possible to be full-time. The second that ome could be full-time by splitting shifts between departments ie working 20 hrs cafe shifts and 20 hrs cashiering shifts. I was told third that the hours were not there for me to do so. Finally I was told that this would not qualify me for full-time benefits anyway. Its also apparent theres no room to grow because all these TLs are pulled in from Chicago law schools or whereever instead of fostering company talent.

The employee ""discount"" is some kind of weird company-tokens deal. I guess this is somehow legal but in order to get access to the employee discount you have to sign up for the target credit card. You can only use that credit card if you want the discount. 

This is more of a pet peeve but in the kitchen you have to use a dull edge rocking pizza cutter because they dont trust you with a real pizza cutter. Ironically, nearly all the equipment in the kitchen will cut you. Every piece of the popcorn machine, the wings on the oven, the crumb trays in the oven, and most absurdly: the tray that holds the dull edged rocking pizza cutter. Please make it make sense. Worst of all, the first aid kit had no bandages. When I told a TL about it she brought two. Thanks, one for me and then one for the next person and then its someone elses problem I guess?

Oh, also there was the MORTIFYING ordeal in orientation where the leader asked us to tell a story of our preconceived judgements against a class of people (I guess for the sake of wokeness?) And he talked about how he, as a black man, used to be very into BLM but then one time a cop let him get away with doing 90 in a 35. Like, what story was anyone supposed to tell here that wouldnt be wildly offensive for the first day?

I worked at Target part-time for more than 3 years
Pros
- Management was relatable
- Other workers were kind
- Since you are there a lot there was more chance to find deals
- Nice Pay
Cons
- To many tasks yet too little time. 
- Schedule was inconsistent.
- Hours on feet can be very straining.
- Some workers are lazy and you have to pull their weight 
- Consistent change to what you are supposed to do.
- Hiring is speradic and makes no sense how they choose who to hire.
