I was totally new to child welfare but was given no real overview and virtually no plan specific training. As other team members left, their case loads were either put into the supervisors’ names where they would receive no coordination services or simply added to a colleague’s caseload. I was initially told I would be case managing 55 high/complex acuity cases-when I left I had 124. Technology is archaic. TruCare is terrible and 40 team members were expected to enter twice daily updates on a Sharepoint document that only one person could work in at a time. I finally left as I was nervous to have my name on cases that I did not have the time to outreach. This company pays lip service to diversity and community responsibility but is essentially making money off the most vulnerable members of society.
Advice to Management
Have a dedicated team in place to deal with SASS follow up. Hire more staff so case managers are not over their limit - you have already been sued for this. Basically, make sure you have the staff, technology, and processes in place before accepting millions of dollars to deliver health care to a disadvantaged population.

","They take advantage of their employees, not paying the employees who have been around longer more money. 

Don’t even ask for a pay bump because the company will make every excuse why they will not !
And during the recruitment process they will offer you the least amount possible and say you are on “ a competitive salary “.

They don’t care if your about to be homeless just remember that. 

And during the holidays, they do not give out any bonuses but they definitely give you a cheap company gift. 
Not even a gift card but a REAL REAL CHEAP charger lol. Not even Walmart will sell. 
 
Forget even trying to get promoted or even transfer to a different department it’s like jumping through hoops. 

They do not really evaluate supervisors so prepare yourself, you will be taking the blame for a lot for them. 

Just... look at another job. Unless do you want a job that pretends to care ( fake).
Advice to Management
Do better by the people. Not with your stupid gyms, or food court, or cheap gifts. 

But evaluate your supervisors just like any regular employee. 
They may have been a good fit in the past but are they still a good fit for the position ? 

How about making sure everyone on a team is getting paid the same. 
I don’t mean one person gets 25 per hour and another person making 21 per hour
Calling it the “spectrum “ or saying “ your on a competitive salary”. ( what a joke) 

 
Actually give people the opportunity to work from home. Why do you need to see my face everyday! 

Offer overtime to every department and not just to some departments or when it’s the holiday season and it’s convenient to you. 
If you’re not gonna pay people what they are worth then at least give them the leeway to make more money without having to look for a second job. 

Main advice: Have more integrity ! 
Not with just supervisors, but recruiters as well. 

The company could be really great if you treated people how you would like to be treated. 
For a company who Bragged about “everyone “ ( company) making more money. The only person who made more money is you. 
Did the employees who make everything happen receive anything?! No, we just have to be grateful to be employed right ? 
Not even your health insurance plans are cheap. 
You have lawyers 
( we the employees have to pay for) 
You have tutoring

- some exceptional individuals work here both professionally and personally
","- The culture is very resistant to change
- The culture is very antagonistic when crossing teams (not usually within teams that I have seen)
- The IT processes that are in place are very clumsy and time consuming. For example to open a port between two servers within the datacenter can easily take two months to complete.
- There are many undefined processes in IT as well, these are then rejected by default forcing escalation to leadership and weeks to get rather simple low risk items completed
- Change management process is very cumbersome. The simplest non intrusive change will typically require about 4 hours of just paperwork and you and at least one teammate working after hours to deploy, regardless if that's appropriate or not
Advice to Management
Try to foster a more collaborative culture. The teams seem to have an antagonistic relationship. Typically when requesting an item outside of your team, the default is to reject it, or include bureaucratic overhead until it goes away. This typically requires leadership to get resolved.

I like a lot of things about the senior leadership, but chose to rate them as a 2 below due to the culture at the company. Some of the leadership has certainly not been around long enough to make significant impact on the culture, and I sincerely hope they will.

WFH is very important to some employees, although others like being in office. COVID has shown that companies can thrive with large remote workforces. Some people simply live too far away from the nearest office for commuting to be practical, or live in busy city areas where daily commutes are 1+ hour. For some people, commutes can interfere with their family life and make a normal family life impossible — after a 2-hour commute, I was too exhausted to enjoy time with my wife. Post-COVID, if WFH is discontinued and all employees have to be in-office, I would have to resign. I feel that the anti-WFH viewpoint is primarily top-down from the CEO, I would encourage Mr. Neidorff to reconsider this policy at least in situations where employees are far from the office.

There is a lot of people who are dedicated to what they do, reliable in getting work done, but still able to have fun and unload while not losing focus. The people make development at Centene fun, and the work can be fun with the different and ever changing environments being worked on.
","The work can be frustrating because of the ever changing environment. Between that and the way security is ran, there is a lot of inefficiencies with no way around them. A project could be a sprint away from a demo and the team could be completely rearranged with only one person left on the team and everyone else thrown on other teams. The fact that the work is always fresh is fun for a few months, then it becomes a chore. Besides the hectic environmental changes, there are many things that can be frustrating such as development constraints with an ever increasing security footprint. The security is great when it doesn't interfere with coding, but when a developer cannot access github issues due to a new security incentive, it gets frustrating.
Advice to Management
Please don't change the environment every few months. People can build a good team that will have a lot of cohesion for a long time, and ripping them apart to throw people on projects that may be seen as adding more 'business value' really becomes jarring. Also, try to make a more invisible security footprint. When the security is hindering work of developers, then our work slows way down.

","For a company that espouses better lives for its members, this company sure goes out of its way to screw employees. 

When I became eligible for benefits, I learned that the company had assumed I was a smoker and was back-charging me a surcharge even though I've never smoked in my life and I wasn't given an opportunity to sign an affidavit.

During my performance review, I was told my ""merit"" increase would be cut in half because I started halfway through the year. Not my bonus, my merit increase. Why would my forward-looking salary be cut in half because I started mid-year? And why did the ""merit"" increase turn out to be exactly the cost-of-living/inflation?

Today was the final straw. The company announced the new benefits plan which doesn't allow spousal coverage if they're eligible through another employer. We have been paying our Employee + Spouse plus a $50/paycheck surcharge and they just made it clear that they prefer single people as employees.

I've turned away more than a dozen people who have reached out to me on LinkedIn to find out what it's like to work at Centene. It's terrible and the company treats its employees very badly. I would not recommend it and am taking steps to finish my education then go work for an employer that cares about me and my family.

","Insufficient training did not prepare us for the onslaught of issues within the company and their main database, which was constantly malfunctioning. Lack of communication between departments led to misinformation across the board. There are many problems in claims processing and authorizations, but very few solutions, or methods in place for team collaboration in service of Providers and Members. The worse things got, the more Management negatively criticized their team, many of whom were already buckling under the stress of angry calls and system issues. This led to many contracts being lost and a company-wide lay-off.

There were also some cultural issues—bullying, aggressive behavior, inappropriate humor. HR lived at the building in the next town over, and anytime the she was called to address something, nothing was done. If you reported enough times, or encouraged others to report misconduct, you were seen as the problem.
Advice to Management
Hire a new HR team and establish a zero tolerance for the negative behaviors previously listed. Invest in your database and get your training up to speed so your people aren’t learning their job trial by error. Praise your Reps more than you criticize—your system is broken and they are the legs you stand on. Arrange weekly brainstorm meetings for your Reps. Encourage them to communicate with you, training, and each other about the issues they are seeing on a regular basis and potential solutions. Establish methods for departments to collaborate with each other to create working solutions or at least a scripted response for everyone to use.

","Working from home seems to be a new venture for this company due to the disfunction of their training time and capabilities. It is my opinion the trainers are new to this as well and have only trained onsite prior to this. It appears their structure is still geared as if you are training on-site. I believe they should take into consideration before you are turned loose. The first week was all about getting the technical glitches out of the way with quipment which bleed over into second week of training. Their are still technical issues but finally at a minimum after 4 weeks. You do not have time to do each training module due to the glitches which restricts your actually practice on how to handle calls. If you are going to train to work from home and your training is done at home, you better be able to catch on fast. This is a cram session to get all of your training completed in a four week time frame.
Advice to Management
My advice is you need to add additional training if you are going to train outside actual on-site areas. The level of ability to become successful depends on how well your trainers are capable of training online. When there are major glitches in equipment issues, and technical issues, those tend to eat into any time you would have for practice on learning the software program you utilize. It eats into the time to cover all modules to prepare your new hires. At-home employees do not have a supervisor or trainer nearby to actually see the problems a new hire is going through other than what is able to be communicated online. This is a major drawback in my opinion.

The company deliberately declines providers claims, they down code provider claims without justification, when provider rates are increased they hold off implementing the correct rates, when providers are due large incentive checks, they date the checks the first of the month--deliver them a month later. (for a month they are earning interest off of Billions of dollars given to them by the state to give to the providers.

Advice to Management
There is a culture that is political and negative in nature. You are expected to come in early and stay late. It's like a game to see who can stay the latest, without any productivity occurring. Hiring people based off academic credentials alone is not sufficient vetting. Many managers to not have the emotional intelligence and sometimes general intelligence to lead teams. There is a culture/fear of failure that enables individuals to inflate numbers/ projections. No one wants to tell a supervisor that a program is actually under performing. Colleagues are cut throat in there way to the top due to expansion and multiple openings. Managers with 4 or less employees under them, just because the company ""had"" to fill the position. Many employees do busy work and are not being used efficiently. This company would have no problem cutting a third of the workforce if they spent time hiring the right individuals who are competent and efficient at their job.

","For Medicaid recipients, the quality of the majority of Centene health plans is poor and not representative of a leader in the field. The number of contract terminations and sanctions against the company are disturbing. Plan presidents have commented in the past that it is cheaper to pay the sanction than to fix the related problem. Instead of trying to do quality improvement, the campany focuses on trying to get the fine reduced that is charged for a sanction.

For the local Clayton community, Centene purchased the land which had a community garden. The garden was removed to put up another building. This building is for Centene University. The CEO commented that members of the community should get out of the way of progress.

For employees, Centene does not teat employees fairly or consistently. Those in the inner circle ignore HR policies and give extra vacation time to those who they like. Other employees have their vacation requests ignored and neither approved not denied. Vacation time is accrued at a very slow pace over the year and is then taken away if not used that year. In Missouri, Centene will not pay you for your unused vacation. In California, state law requires that Centene pays employees for unused vacation.

Whether for members, the community, or for employees, Centene only does the right thing when required to by state governments.

","Those with positional leadership roles do not take accountability for their departments. Instead they ignore issues until there is a major financial implication or a potentially high profile complaint surfaces. At that moment, they expect front-line members to drop everything, work extended hours and often spend most of their day on phone calls. They will often deflect responsibility to other departments or the front-line members creating an image that their direct reports are not competent.

There are also, ""clicks"" in which leaders utilize the talent of only their preferred direct reports and will push them to higher opportunities. They also, utilize the talents of individuals and then pretends as if they did not contribute and then hands that person's efforts to their preferred team member, who was not skilled in the tasks.

Sun Dec 29 2019, Data Analyst,"Clayton, MO",Former Employee ,Awful Company To Work For - Stay Away,6,The pros are very few and far between here. The pay was decent providing you could stay at 40 hours (more on that in the ,"section). The cafeteria was great in downtown Clayton and there's a lot of name recognition when you have the company on your resume at least here in St. Louis.
Cons
Yeah, there's lots here. It's a really toxic culture where burnout is very common and most of the time, you are forced to go over 40 hours most weeks which means you are working for free in those cases. Work/Life balance is non-existent here as I saw many people working 50 and even 60 hours a week and at least in our department, it was so hard to get people hired. What I later found out was that HR is very slow posting jobs so departments poach employees from other departments which is unsustainable because eventually some department is going to the the odd one out and will have to post the position. The Clayton office in particular is very stuffy and very conservative in dress (meaning you have to wear a tie). Also politics runs rampant in the Clayton office so if you don't like that, stop applying and look elsewhere. There were a lot of people I met that I wish I didn't meet because all they cared about was looking good and moving up and would use other people to make them look bad so that they could in turn look good. Business is growing really fast here and I would say probably too fast because the systems and other processes as well as workers have not been able to sustainably adapt to the growth. An example of this is the databases. This is the only company where I've been sent in a queue where I've waited over an hour just to run a query. Meanwhile, I'm just waiting and I'm not being a very productive employee since I need that query to finish so that I can do my job. A big let down for me was when I gave my two weeks notice. They did not explain the process at all and because of that, I lost my flexible spending account to where I can't access the money. Also, they do not pay out on vacation upon leaving the company so I lost that too which is not good policy. Every other company I've been at, I at least got some sort of vacation pay. They also never gave me my exit interview or anything so I guess this is where they're going to get my feedback (albeit in public ). As a side note too, they seem to have this bizarre cult like following of the CEO as his picture is on the home page every time you open it up and he's on every single training video where he adds absolutely no value to the video whatsoever. One time they were pressuring employees to vote for him for some kind of executive of the year award. To sum this up, there are just so many cons for me that there is no way I would recommend this company to even my enemies, never mind my friends. I would tell anyone reading this to stay far away from this place.

","Products and platforms are buggy and bloated, and much time is spent listening to middle managers threaten people with weekend work unless it gets fixed yesterday.

Corporate culture to the max. Very sterile and old fashioned. Laser focus on security means if you want to download your favorite tools, be prepared for a long wait as the software requests make their way through a byzantine labyrinth of managers, product owners, etc.

An additional con caused by the glacial pace of things there: if you are an engineer, good luck being ready to do 'real work' within your first month. In my case, I was the only new team member, and my environment was perpetually crippled. Everyone else had been there so long that their environments worked and they couldn't remember how they got around the issues I was facing (or they were using legacy tools that 'just worked' but God forbid I get set up like them, it's the new way or nothing). Documentation that could help was sorely lacking, as well.

But the biggest con (in more ways than one) was being seriously misled about the nature of my role, which I found out is par for the course for the branch I was a part of. I understand that it's not uncommon for a role to change a bit once you're brought on, but this was a major shift from what was talked about in my interview.

","Centene buys up companies without understanding what made them attractive to buy and would rather muck everything up by installing their way of doing things. Tricare is different then all other health insurance yet they have completely ignored that fact and run it into the ground. They love to hire people at the very top for Tricare that have ZERO healthcare experience let alone Tricare experience. They love to use outside consultants that have ZERO Tricare and possibly healthcare experience. They have jettisoned countless people that we actually need and replaced them (or not) with cheaper, less experienced and to be frank, not qualified people. I honestly believe this company likes to complicate things rather then simplify in a well planned effort to never have to answer as to why things are done the way are done because everyone is trying to figure out how to fix things that Centene has broken all in the name of some weird attempt at progress. Everything, and I mean everything is wrapped in layer upon layer upon layer which creates constant confusion. The higher you climb the ladder, the more you will see just how inept at running a business this company is. That is a high level view but if you want to know about the little stuff- unless you are in California, your PTO will reset each year, pay not even close to being comparable to other companies, high cost for healthcare, ; dinosaur ideologies like no remote work ability, stringent dress code, and an utter lack of reward for hard work.

Mon Jul 29 2019, Business Analyst,"Clayton, MO",Former Employee ,"Hostile, Mean, and Corrupt Corporate Culture",14,"Despite the many concerns I have with Centene, there are many good people who work there. These people mainly exist at the rank and file and first line supervisor levels of the company. It appears that one has to internalize the mean culture of Centene in order to advance to the rank of manager or above.
","My manager was a bully who engaged in the following unprofessional behavior:

• Notorious micromanager who reveled in tightly controlling the work of their subordinates.
• Lacked the ability to interact with others in a normal manner. Often yelled and belittled people instead of respectfully making their point. Unwilling to complement employees when deserved.
• Played favorites with employees. Favored employees were allowed to openly break the rules and perform at such a low level that they were effectively rendered incompetent.
• Did not consistently hold employees accountable for quality of work. For instance, one employee kept track of user acceptance testing issues by scribbling them on post it notes that were shoved into a desk drawer. These issues should have been recorded in a tool such as Excel or SharePoint.
• Berated employees for not completing an impossibly large amount of work in a very short timeframe. Did not listen to explanations on why this timeframe was insufficient. This was often used as an excuse to discipline employees.
• Made up and changed rules on the fly in order to fabricate reasons to discipline employees.

Other concerns with Centene outside of my management include:

The cliquish coworkers ostracize those who are not friends with them and exclude them from work related conversations and meetings.

One coworker in another department developed the habit of not communicating with me directly when contacted with work related items. They preferred instead to communicate indirectly through another coworker who happened to be their friend. 

The team that my group interacted with most frequently was impossible to deal with due to their rude behavior. One person on that team falsely told me that they could physically visit my team’s workspace to discuss work items, but that we weren’t allowed to visit their workspace. They even refused to tell me where their team worked at. 

I never received the proper systems accesses to fully perform my job. Nobody even seemed to know all of the necessary accesses for my position. There should have been a list of the accesses needed for each role.

My department technically had SharePoint, but it was unusable due to not being set up properly. Nobody knew who to contact to set it up properly. Other teams had functioning SharePoint sites, but they were unwilling to help us.

The turnover in my department was astonishing. The department had 23 employees and I only know of three who were in the department for 3 or more years, but there may have been two or three others.

Centene has an obnoxious requirement that male employees at the corporate headquarters in Clayton, MO (St. Louis area) wear ties as part of the corporate formal dress code at headquarters. This only applies to Clayton and does not apply to the rest of the St. Louis area or elsewhere in the country. The tie requirement needs to be removed.

","Centene is too busy expanding to invest in their employees

It was so chaotic working there, very long working hours and stressful without proper requirement. Mandatory OT constantly. Poor work ethics and poor leadership . Managers across multiple levels have poor leadership skills and give no substantial direction for their teams. You will be treated unfairly if you are not apart of a click. 

Fix your management structure in Utilization Management and train your direct managers so that they have some idea how to lead individuals. Engage with your employees more so you can find management inefficiencies and correct them before your employees continue to leave. We were overworked and a majority of my colleagues are unhappy & looking elsewhere for employment. Pick a solution to a problem and stick to it for more than a few days before attempting another type of solution. This causes confusion among the workers and forces pointless meetings (which are interrupting our work) just to figure out what we actually need to do this time, only for the method to change a few days later.

Everyone walks around like sad zombies in fluorescent lighting staring at the clock till their shift in purgatory is over.

The training that I received was also terrible. In the ten months. Overall, the people here are rude and nasty if you have a question or need help, especially the leads and supervisors. I was seriously considering taking legal actions, but I decided not to. I also think my salary should have been more considering the difficulty of the work and the expectations.

Lastly, micromanaging, retaliation when disagreeing with management, 
unorganized; not enough tools to do the job; not innovative; no option to telecommute.

","Slow moving Fortune 100 company that in my division was disorganized and always had an excuse why something didn’t get done. I came in excited and ready to work with my team only to realize this place doesn’t welcome Or appreciate education, experience or ideas. They do hire from within which is commendable but they put people in positions without relevant experience or training and their subordinates and the organization suffer. I was sorely disappointed with the apathy and absolute disregard for the values outlined when you interview and hire on. Centene functions like other government run establishments where they get paid as long as they do the bare minimum while
meeting the ethnic quotas. If you like this type of environment, apply. I don’t and feel this organization abuses tax payer monies by having so many non contributing employees and managers, senior managers, directors and so on with minimal productivity who also do the bare minimum but maintain their titles and positions in the company. Proceed with caution here as there may be good divisions but I know some are really messed up. Some people coast and do the minimum but some roles will be expected to give till it hurts with no thanks or appreciation.
Advice to Management
Manage, Lead, Communicate and at least act like you care about things being done well for your team members. Say thank you when people work hard for you, their teams and the company. Quit having meetings about meetings where resolve and action are ignored. I’d share more but in my experience, management hires the leaders into the positions. Perhaps upper
management created this culture? The philosophy seems to be that the front line people work hard and are held accountable while leadership coasts and sit in meeting after meeting accomplishing as little as
possible. Too bad. Some really good people work here who will eventually leave or join the “don’t do too much” philosophy.

Speaking of leadership, I'm not sure how these roles are decided but there is an obvious biasness within the infrastructure.

They spew fake positivity in unsolicited emails and meetings often times forcing there religious views on you. There is no room for growth within this contact center unless you willing to compromise your integrity, intelligence and morals; then you can join the ranks of the rest of the ""Team Leads & Sups"" who sits openly on the floor and degrade agents and discuss how many guys he sleeps with.

","Centene is too busy expanding to invest in their employees. Centene’s talent acquisition team employs deceitful tactics when working with potential employees/applicants. This includes promoting Centene as a corporation that cares about their employees, offers a flexible work schedule, a balanced work-family life and competitive bonuses. These promises were found to be lies. Centene’s policies are stuck in the past. They refuse to offer flexible work hours and demand an 8-5pm work schedule. Salaried employees are not treated as such and making schedule adjustments to meet the necessary needs of a family (ie medical appointments) are frowned upon. Bonuses are sparing and many excuses are provided by senior management as to why bonuses are not higher. Furthermore, Centene does not take the time to find qualified persons for their management teams. Managers are under qualified and extremely unprofessional. Incidents such as racial slurs directed toward team members, inappropriate personal comments from directors and threats to “write-up” entire teams were only a few of the disgusting behaviors seen by management while employed by Centene. Sadly, when reports were made to Human Resources little if anything was done. This is not an organization of integrity.

","Centene appears to the community as a great company to work for, that is has the best benefits, and that there is always room for growth and opportunity. While this may be the case in some departments, this is not true in most. There is a lack of professional development and top down leadership is highly lacking. Certain degrees, skill sets, and years of experience are undervalued. Work ethic is appreciated, but not rewarded. People who are under-qualified for their jobs seem to have job security due to the political environment of a large corporation. High-level leaders are not leaders, but rather micromanagers.

Additionaly, the HR department is atrocious. If you have a discrepancy with your benefits or paycheck or want to find out any information, a ticket is generated and you get a form response. Their leave benefits (bereavement, maternity leave) are minimal and they make it very difficult to find out clear information .

There is also a poor work/life balance. In most departments, working from home is never an option, and while salaried employees regularly work well beyond their paid 40 hours, flexibility is rarely given when time off is needed.

Thu Sep 06 2018, Leadership,"Saint Louis, MO",Former Employee ,Leadership,12,"A lot of good fundamental things but they are only on the surface. Dig deeper and read the cons below. Good Compensation (especially for the Officers), Good Benefits, Company Growth, Health Care Industry, Business model. They make so much money using Federal tax dollars that they can afford to over pay the Sr Executives huge bonuses, stock options and waste money with multiple jets, executive retreats and lavish spending. Much of that money should be spent on the Medicaid and Medicare recipients. It is too extreme.
","It all starts at the top -- Executive Leadership, Partners and HR Co Leadership . They are smart and the company is doing well BUT the philosophy and value of people is a sham. They can and do act a good game at the right moments but they are not caring people with tyrant like behavior and they only care about money and stock price. The treatment of people is horrible. Very disrespectful and unprofessional behavior behind closed doors. Childish behavior like giving the silent treatment to other executives before cowardly having someone else fire them and throwing them out of the building.
The HR Co-Leadership pair have no experience in HR. They have no idea about people or HR practices. They follow the McKinsey model of minimal HR, with locked doors and no access, uncaring and employees having to fend for themselves only getting telemarketer like answers to real employee needs to HR questions. The philosophy and values of people that built the company are deliberately being eliminated including those great HR people who built the solid people culture. They are good at showing charts and talking about how great things are and how much better they are while the truth being that they are not better. They do not provide opportunities for questions or input because they has no answers, just rhetoric. The Compensation philosophies are the weakest and most inconsistent comp strategies I have ever seen. The HR leaders only care what those above them say, not about what the people need. The only focus is on money and stock price and making their big money. They are only there short term and there for the money. I would be careful buying this stock. It is a house of cards. 
If all the former executives were interviewed and were honest they would confirm and be able to provide a lot of examples of what I am saying. I would think long and hard about taking a job with them. They will entice you with golden hand cuffs which is why so many good people are still there. It really isn't worth your health, integrity or values. They have had several good people leave and even some who just got there over the past couple years. Several of their leaders have health related illness from the stress and poor treatment. Take a look at the number of good long term and even some short term Directors and VP's throughout the company and especially in HR that have left the company. They did a great job building a wonderful business and culture. Why did they leave? Be very careful and do your research before you choose to join Centene, especially in a leadership position. Beware what you are being told and sold is a lie.
Advice to Management
Change Sr Executive Leadership and HR Leadership and philosophies of people and HR practices. These people are not qualified and are poorly leading this organization into a massive collapse. I feel bad for all the good that this is impacting and will impact including employees, members and providers. It can be saved with massive changes in leadership and HR.

Thu Aug 30 2018, Program Coordinator,"Pittsburgh, PA",Former Employee ,NEEDS IMPROVMENT,8,"From the begining ive only heard great things about Centene.. its Great company to work for on the corporate level. Great pay. Benefits. CENTENE seems to have a really great idea on how to care for their employees . I love the team of people that I work with. I think Centenes over all plan for how things should be for their company, for their employees is great it just needs to be implicated with in PA HEALTH AND WELLNESS NOW.
","I work for the health plan in Pittsburgh PA. Called PA Health and Wellness. They dont strive to hold on to CENTENE standards. I was hired through a temp agency at the time the plan had not gone live so we were just doing busy work until 1-1-18 Everthing that we were told to promote about the health plan was false we had no real understanding how things were going to work before hand (and still have so many flaws and unknowns after 9 months).. which being that we were a start up company you dont expect it to be perfect but It turned out it was a lot of lies we were feeding participants just to win their enrollment . Almost everything changed or had a catch to it... We have providers that are not being paid then providers that are being over paid (thousands of dollars) .claims denying and all the claims department can tell us is the system they use is denying them We can never get a clear answer to follow up with the people who are calling us (the call center front line) for answers. When I was hired (both times, through the agency and then through the company when I was converted) i was hired for a customer service position , with out notice (and even while keeping my direct supervisor and manager in the dark) they decided they were going to move everyone from the customer service department to the program coordinator team and gave us just a few days notice that we would be starting training for the new position no questions asked .. just like everything else thus far it was poorly planned and poorly executed. We had one week of training and a couple of meetings and were thrown to the wolves... The program coordinator team makes $2-$3 more than we did and we were promised an increase. But only the people who were with a temp agency on our team received an increase. The full time people did not receive an increase and for the past 3 months have been promised that it was going to be corrected we were going to receive back pay but no one has even discussed the pay with us even after reaching out several times to management. And we have yet to be compensated but we have been working in the position at our Lower pay rate since june 4th ,with promises of rectification in the works. I've seen supervisors butt heads right out on the floor in front of staff. Managers who have no real duty now since the CSR department is no longer. PA Health and Wellness is not meeting the Awesome CENTENE STANDARDS that I've heard and read of. I think some one from the top need to come down and put things in order. They promise room to grow but since management has favorites they are the ones promoted. SME team act like it's a burden on them to help the staff they are assigned to help. They take a poll on what questions staff has . Or suggestions and you never hear anything back although promised every question will be answered . If your not management corporate staff your treated poorly by SOME of the leadership like they are better than you. And I've already changed seats 3 times since being there just 1 year. Everyone has their hands in the authorization pot they want us to answer back to back calls and for every department. Claims calls, participant calls, provider calls, Dev8ice coordinator calls , and still build and correct authorizations as well. and Transportation smh i dont even want to get in ro the issues our participants have with transportation it's just a big mess that really needs to be addressed and all that seems to matter is at least we are don't better than the other 2 MCO's we are up against. I heard a member of the management team say

I worked at Centene full-time
Pros
Pay is competitive, benefits are standard to the industry.

Work-life balance is good. Still alternates between very busy and very slow days.

Most actuarial coworkers are nice, smart, helpful. Other departments can be less helpful.

Okay place for entry level analysts or interns to get some health insurance exposures. Not much training and learning opportunities thou

No micromanagement, no strict in and out time
Cons
No professional advancement. Roles are filled with outside hires.

Actuaries do not get the level of recognition seen in other insurance companies.

Work load is unevenly distributed. Some are overworked, others watch the clock.

Laptops and networks have frequent issues, disrupting workflow.

Issues in IT and data are hastily patched without permanent solutions.

No jeans allowed.

","Awful Management, Favoritism, Managers bully their staff and employees are afraid of speaking up. When you as an individual decide to stand up to your boss bully, they will then make it hard for you. Employees are so afraid to talk about how they are treated so they end up leaving the organization. Human Resources agree with management instead of helping find solutions. HR at Sunshine Health is truly a joke in Orlando. They don’t believe what they say yet alone what you say. Management will win in Orlando regardless if you are being bullied or not.
No flexibility
No clue on job classification (Field / Office)
No care of staff, more work no pay. 
It starts out good to end bad.
Processes are broken
They don’t listen to the staff who are working or the staff that is qualified. Management have no clue what you do because they are too busy being happy about their checks and bonuses. 
Lot of talk, promises with no rewards. 
Most people are only there for the pay and benefits otherwise, your choice. 
Employee Retention - A joke! They let the qualified hard working ones walk out the door and beg the ones who have no clue to stay and pay more.
Advice to Management
Listen to your staff about your managers. They are not disgruntled people, all they want is to be treated fair and heard. Managers are truly an issue in Orlando especially HR. Ask around make it anonymous and see what you get. You will shocked. Sadly, put qualified people in positions and not those who are friends. Hire better HR people that are not biased. There need to be some under cover bosses in these buildings.

Sun Aug 12 2018, Project Manager,"Saint Louis, MO",Current Employee ,Counting Down the Days at Centene,12,"I’ll update this review when I can think of anything.
","-Good ole boys club management from the 1950s. I’ve witnessed managers cutting off reports during meetings, belittling them, and treating their reports terribly. There needs to be more diversity in management-race, age, sex, thought process- than there is. Perhaps require more management training for managers. Give employees MORE opportunities to give anonymous feedback on their manager’s performance AND take action. There is so much dysfunction in management it’s no wonder this company is rated so terribly by employees.
-Micromanagement to the max. Seriously, it’s common knowledge at this point (2018) micromanaging has a negative effect on productivity and morale. Insecure managers need to go or be let go. Centene management still figuring this out unfortunately.
-Security run amuck. Major imbalance between security and productivity. Security needs to be reigned in and counterbalanced with functionality and usability. Systems are locked down to the point that you can’t even make simple adjustments to settings on your laptop. At corporate, you have to swipe your badge half a dozen times just to get to your desk. It’s a joke.
-No maternity leave policy. Sorry, young families. You’re on your own.
-Cube walls at corporate office are glass. The environment is so disruptive and distracting. Who thought this was a good idea? No sense of privacy whatsoever. Newsflash- Open office environments make some employees miserable and have a negative impact on productivity. 
-No work from home policy. Seriously, it’s almost 2019. That needs to change.
-Men at corporate required to wear ties. Again, that place is so backwards that appearances are favored over substance. Managers scheduling meetings every other day to follow up (micromanage) a project- again, only appearing to be useful. Start measuring performance based on what’s actually produced rather than superficialities, and allow your team to succeed by giving them more autonomy.

Information is siloed, and not shared, creating a competitive culture that does not foster team work. There's competition/friction within and between departments. Managers micro-manage and treat subordinates like privates in the military - they are to be quiet and follow orders. Its a good ole boys club, if your female, non-white, LGBTQ don't expect a promotion. Its gotten a little better for females lately.

People work out of fear of being walked out. Most do not stay long enough to become vested (5 years). They simply give up. Culture is toxic and comes from the top down. Only 4 sick days per year. Once that's exceeded, you are ripe to be written up or fired. Those who bring the best experience and education are the ones held back the most. HR is non-existent. Trying to meet with them is nearly impossible, and they work only for risk management and prevention of lawsuits. Yes, it's a job, but that's about it.

This creates a situation where you will constantly be redoing the same project. Turnover is between 25 and 30 percent across the organization and the average employee tenure is around 1 year. Leadership has said on multiple occasions that anyone who leaves the organization is not mentally strong enough to cut it here.

But hey, stock price is up so as far as leadership is concerned there are no problems. Don't be one of the 10,000 people who leave every year. Save yourself the heartache. I wish I would have.

","Terrible company culture where corporate employees openly express distaste for non-corporate employees, even to the the extent of delighting when a newbie can't hack the ""Centene way"" and wisely leaves to join a company with a more respectful and professional work environment. Reactions to people giving notice is typically ""Centene isn't for everyone"" and ""another one bites the dust"". It is ingrained in the company culture for leaders to get ahead by blaming others and throwing others under the bus (including their own staff), rather than be accountable for mistakes. DO NOT believe anyone who tells you there is great work/life balance (unless you think working 60+ hours every week 50+ weeks out of the year and still not keeping your head above water is balanced). Taking time off is a nightmare, because both before and after, you work 80 hours a week to catch up. There are very, very few pockets of the organization where work/life balance is obtainable. Immature and unprofessional leadership even at director and VP levels. Favoritism is rampant. If you don't work in Corporate or if you come from an acquired company, you are treated like dirt and are blatantly discriminated against (less favorable work and work loads; you are always assumed to be wrong and stupid, so you are constantly having to defend yourself; you are held accountable for following unproductive bureaucratic ""standard"" processes and constantly criticized for nit picky things that the favorites are not and your scheduled is micromanaged, even when you are an exempt employee working late every day and most weekends to try to keep from drowning; your questions or suggestions will be met with a condescending response IF you even get one). Forget about any blip of schedule flexibility and any telecommuting, they are not allowed, even on a small scale.

Sat Apr 07 2018, Manager,"Sunrise, FL",Current Employee ,Quantity over Quality,8,"Growing company and great benefits. Offices are very nice. Yearly bonuses and salary increases. Large Nationwide company allowing for relocation options.
","Essential components of quality and integrity have been lost over the last several years. Leadership is more concerned about pushing numbers and visibility to corporate than training and development of staff or providing quality services. Employees are treated as robots. Poor employee satisfaction- employee complaints, HR involvement, and resignations are the norm. Little respect for your time- meetings are consistently scheduled only mins before and everything seems to be “URGENT” making it difficult to know how to prioritize tasks/projects. Work expectations are communicated poorly and often with contradicting directives. Upper Leadership is punitive and talk about employees negatively.
Advice to Management
Listen to staff! Streamline work processes and train effectively. Communicate a consistent message. Don’t blame and reprimand staff because of leadership’s disorganization. Have leadership trained in effective management and leadership skill.

","Your working for all white men and a token black who is irrelevant. They hire the people who will do their dirty work in management , if your gay or outspoken you will not be promoted a man told me out his own mouth our manager said he would never be a supervisor when our supervisor was begging him to apply . If you have style the dress code will change until you won’t be able to wear anything but a full suit . They not only discriminate by race but by age, sexual preference, personality, the supervisors idea of you is all you are. MB the head man is someone’s nephew who doesn’t know how to run anything other than his mouth and point fingers at his managers who in turn point them at the workers . Upper leaders outside the location had to come in and investigate . Half the department takes FMLA for stress.
