Sat Dec 13 2014,N/A,"Orlando, FL","Store Manager in Orlando, FL",15 year manager,917,"I learned a lot working there as far as how to run a business as well as how to develop a team. I had one of the most successful teams in the company ranking as the top store year over year in two separate markets, one in the Northeast one in the Southeast. I was a paragon winner with the company as well. My most recent DM was very supportive. I genuinely thank them for the opportunity and the knowledge that I acquired while working with them.
","Work hours were excessive. To be successful hours worked were borderline slavery. While I willingly worked them to be successful, the week you didn't you were immediately behind. Vacations were almost non existent due to constant visitors from corporate stopping in to do reviews. Holiday weeks were paid 4 days regular 1 holiday and you worked all 5. The facade of the stores looking great when these people stop by versus the reality of the business is polarizing. There were always teams of people and excessive expenditures of payroll thrown into stores prior to their visits. While I understood the need to make an appearance, it was always will always be a backwards way off thinking. Company preaches quality of life for their clients while quality of life for their employees is non-existent. As a ""manager"" in your average store you will be ""managing"" a total of one person during your shift, with a total of 10 people at location. Location open hours will exceed total payroll hours ie Sun-Sat 7am-10pm = 15hrs per day x 7 days x 2 people = 210 hrs which excludes the need to have a person unload deliveries that come in during non opened hours. Your budgeted hours will be approximately 208 hrs. I will only mention that during the month of December that there are extended hours for the stores but no budgeted hours to accommodate. Stores are held to strict shrink targets with little to no control over external theft. Remember 2 people at location, if four people enter to steal there is nothing you can do to stop them. These are facts not personal prejudices.
Advice to Management
Revisit business structure. Employ cost cutting at a higher level, not at a store level otherwise you will compromise the business. If DMs are losing company vehicles so should RMs. Loss Prevention should be completely eliminated due to the fact they are ineffective and non-impactful; they are a voice with no power. I challenge corporate figures to walk into stores unannounced to anyone to really see what happens in the average minimum hours location. I make this challenge knowing that they will not as this is of no interest to them. At corporate level within the company they have never managed a location so they have no understanding. I do not fault them they are well educated and were placed into their positions.

Advice to Management
Management Take time to actually care about your employees. There’s a difference between being a manager and being a leader. A leader it’s going to have a more effective team. Never be above your team in the sense that… Never ask them to do something you wouldn’t do yourself. If they know that you will do it it changes the game and aren’t you so much respect that you don’t even realize it.

Although it's great to reward employees that have been with the company a long time (or their entire career).

Stop pretending to promote work-life balance, but then reprimand people for not being available 24/7.

Mon Jan 11 2021, Certified Pharmacy Technician,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Would not recommend it,1,"Great immediate team, quick hiring process, pays better than general retail cashiering
","Corporate cares an infinate amount more about money than actually helping people. Stores are constantly chastised for numbers- if a certain amount of people wanting flu shots do not arrive daily, we get blamed for it. The pay is laughable considering what we go through. Especially those of us with certification have to undergo a lot of studying and practice to become good at what we do, yet the average technician hourly rate is usually just a few dollars over minimum wage. If patients complain over long waits, a script being held up due to doctors negligence, or many other things beyond our control, the whole pharmacy becomes put under scrutiny for it. During the coronavirus outbreak, for the first few months none of the staff were provided with PPE, and when we were- we were allowed 1 disposable surgical mask per week. CVS goes on the radio, news, online, and offers resources they haven't even told the employees yet. We know nothing about when we are getting the vaccine, yet our patients yell at us because they heard on a commercial that we do. Honestly it's not a good career move and there are SO many more rewarding careers in pharmacy out there. Please reevaluate where you want to end up before choosing a huge retail company. Hospitals, work from homes, nonprofits, insurance companies I recommend 100%, even if you're just starting out.
Advice to Management
Appreciate your technicians, we are the backbone of the pharmacy. Retail is known for offering the best salaries for pharmacists, yet almost every other pharm job pays higher than what CVS or Walgreens offers their techs. Also- a pizza party or Starbucks gift card helps no one. We are on the front lines every day, and I'm not just talking about the virus. We are the face of the company, and when we are frazzled, overworked, and make small mistakes, take a minute to consider that it may not be our fault. There is a part of a CVS training module that tells us ""stress is a choice, it is your job choose to process it correctly so it does not interrupt your job"", right before they try and squish us to death. Sometimes it makes diamonds, more often it makes coal.

","Computers need to catch up for the innovation. District leaders need to quit using micromanaging as a bandaid, and need to just solve the root cause of problems. Also, care more about their bonuses than their employees; Once an offer is accepted, the hiring process takes way too long. Other places, up to a couple of weeks. CVS, over a month most of the time; More time needs to be allotted for training. It’s worthwhile to invest in proper training time for your future employees.

","Believe all of the rumors when you are told that CVS is the worst company to work for, I wish I did. This company does not value its employees, especially those at store level, and especially in a time of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacies are forced to over-perform while understaffed and under equipped. There are little-to-no safety measures being enforced to protect front line employees. The front store is also forced to perform jobs with outdated tools, resulting in a revolving door of overworked managers who’ve done their best but can’t keep up with the demand of daily tasks and constant let down of not meeting simple goals. The company also employs less than qualified Individuals to oversee entire districts, some of which who have less than even a year experience managing a store or pharmacy, let alone multiple. They will bully newly graduated pharmacists into management positions that they are not ready for, just to have them fail. The company is also notorious for cutting hours during the busiest seasons, leaving employees overworked and customers/patients UPSET.

Sat Jan 23 2021, Pharmacy Technician Trainee,"Las Vegas, NV",Former Employee ,"Training program (OJT/in-store/online) is a joke, don't bother.",1,"Getting to help people manage their health
","Training is a joke. I should have heeded others' reviews before I applied. You can only do computer related training IN a store on their PC, or a 1st generation iPad. Yes, the very first, tiny iPad. Not a big deal if you're young but even with my glasses/readers on, it was extremely difficult to read. Printed handouts (if you even get any--I had to figure out how to print them out myself) are outdated and don't match up to online material being covered. Online training to use the CVS computer system itself is nonexistent; this is all OJT and is very difficult to work in, especially when the pharmacist(s) expect you to master it all in a few days time. A book about commands, screens, etc. would certainly be helpful to have, or have separate classes in on-boarding training that are mandatory to pass before hitting the register. They're more concerned about CYA, law, etc., but not helping you lear their computer system and programs that will actually help you DO you job. Once you apply for your state license through the Board of Pharmacy, it's only good for THAT store (the managing RPh has to sign the paperwork, for each and every store, in person, each and every time). So yes, you can work at as many stores as you want to get extra hours, providing you pay the state board a fee to be licensed in every single store you want to work at. It's the law. Hours: what a joke. their claim to fame is after 1500 OJT hours, you should be prepared to take your state's Pharmacy Technician exam to be certified. Good luck with that, at less than 16 hours per week, it would take someone over two years to do so. I got less than 16 hours my first week at the store I applied FOR and got hired AT (hired BY the managing RPh, at a store right by my house, which was the reason I applied there). During the first week, I was transferred to a different store after being told at the other store ""they were busier"" and I was assured I ""would get more hours there."" Both locations were inside Target stores, btw. The original RPh didn't communicate with the second of the new store I transferred to, at ALL, whatsoever. The first communicated with HER boss only to get my transfer authorized. I was given no new schedule information, nothing about even if and when I should show up, only told the RPh's first name at the new store. That's it. I had to ask the first RPh for the second's cell number, and find out when she was going to be at the other store so I could go introduce myself and see when she wanted me to come in for work. The first RPh puts me in a chain text with the second, and tells the second to pick it up from there. Days go by. AFter going in and meeting the second RPh, I start at her store (very far away from my house). Since there was zero communication between the two managing RPhs, the second assumed I was fully trained. Yes, fully trained. The managing RPh was now on vacation on my first day, and I was working for a second one, who was very nice. I was very frustrated within the first hour or so because they had me dealing with patients who needed their flu shots (with appointments and without). Since I had no training or practice at ALL on the computer system to know how to do any of this, it was ridiculous. No ""help"" flip charts for computer commands exist, so I was on my own. The RPh said ""I really need you to get a handle on doing this by the end of your shift today."" I was infuriated with this, because this ""training process"" was a joke. I spoke to another tech in my frustration, and she took it upon herself to sort of be my mentor, and I felt bad for her because I felt like I was a hot mess, and taking her away from her Production position, which I was. We had a long talk about where I was in the training process, and it became abundantly clear to her that the first RPh dropped the ball entirely. She said she would try to rectify this with the managing RPh at this store, via text and when she returned, even though she was out of town on vacation. I explained to my tech/""trainer"" that this company's online training is a joke, and she only said ""it's all we have."" She was already certified by her prior state before being hired by CVS, so she couldn't really attest to learning the job in the manner that I was. All the other techs at my store were also state certified prior to being employed by CVS. A tech at my first store told me they used to be able to go online and do training at home, but no longer were allowed to do so. There are no manuals, books, handouts, cheat sheets, etc. for learning their computer system. It's ridiculous. And all those codes and abbreviations? You have to learn them all yourself, which is fine. But CVS doesn't have a list on their system of the most common ones or anything, at all. You're expected to figure it all out on your own, search for them in books or on the internet. By the time the Managing RPh came back from vacation a week later, to say I was highly frustrated was an understatement. In this time my trainer was told to tell me that because I didn't have my license at THIS store (which I knew nothing about needing to have), I could only do computer training. There were ""live/virtual"" ONLY classes listed on my sheet of training to complete in the first three weeks (and more thereafter depending on the week you were in). With the exception of the aforementioned, I had completed everything required online from weeks 1-10 by the end of week two! Those ""live/virtual"" only classes--you had to sign up for them, and only after being approved by the managing RPh before I was allowed to choose any dates, because I had to be on the schedule. I still had no printed schedule and had to ask every day when to come back in. Trying to tear the RPh away from doing what they're doing to look at a schedule is a joke, too. She said ""I'm not even going t put you on the schedule for net week (would've bene week 3) til we get this license thing cleared up. Gee, thanks. From my very first day at the first store, no one told me that these certain classes were sign up only, only ""Yeah, you're going to have to get those done somehow."" I inquired about them DURING my first week at the first store, and that's the response I got. No direction on where to or how to sign up for them, nothing. Seems the RPhs don't really KNOW or CARE what all techs are supposed to get trained on, in what time frame, etc. I had my application for my license for this store all printed out and ready to be signed for my second store's RPh the day she returned from vacation. No other RPh at the store could sign it, it had to be the Managing RPh. Had I been able to send it in to the state during the week I waited, I would've received my license via email to work in that store in 2-3 business days and would've been able to be on the schedule for week 3. By the way, it's $50 for each license you apply for. Having not even gotten a check yet, and I already shelled out another $50, I was irritated. While I'm waiting for the license, I really sat down to think about if this job was worth it, and came to the conclusion that for the horrid training you get that it is not. For $13.25/hr (in NV), Pharmacy Technicians at CVS work way too hard and seem stressed from the moment they walk in til they leave. The RPh's at CVS make six figures a year ($70/hr I'm told it works out to be). They work hard and are constantly stressed, too, it seems. I really thought I'd enjoy the position because I was retired from another careers (22 years), and had prior inventory management and logistics experience from the military as well. I resigned my position before the license even came. The RPh understood, and felt that I would've worked out great had I not been hired right before the flu season, the training situation, and during COVID hiring protocols (apparently I was the first employee at that store who was ""fast-track"" hired, whatever that means). From what I was told by other techs, they went to a three week, in person training at an off site location and did all the online stuff that I did at the store BEFORE they stepped into a store to start work. Training was the same, on the computer, in a classroom, just off site. No actual virtual OJT or anything. I don't think it would have mattered. Some said although they were slotted to be trained off site for three weeks, they were finished in a 10 to 14 days or so.
Advice to Management
Revamp your Pharmacy Technician training program. OVERHAUL would be a better word. Seriously. How? Ask any new CPhT that just finished their ""training,"" who aren't afraid to speak their minds for fear of losing their less than 16 hours a week, they'll tell you.

Very supportive and understanding. The store was very neat and clean in all areas from the pharmacy to the Minute Clinic to the front door. There was a very ""we"" like atmosphere that goes beyond the concept of ""team"".
","The job description has nothing at all to do with the job. CVS has a program called CarePass and their main and only focus for the Care Concierge (the job title changes once you are hired from what is advertised) is selling CarePasses and running a cash register. The supervision and technology is subpar, at least in the region that I was assigned to. The Care Concierges are browbeat each and everyday to ""sell"" these CarePasses when selling anything is not mentioned in the job description or running a cash register. I worked there for 4 months and everyday for 4 months I was told to sell CarePasses. CVS says it has gotten into the Durable Medical Equipment business but it has not gotten credentialed to sell these items using insurance so that part of the job is a bust ( at this time). So that means that the job as described in I suppose certain markets is impossible to be carried out. Just don't be duped into taking this job. Some stores have 2 Care Concierges and some have 1 and you have to request time off 6 weeks in advance and get someone to work in your place. If you are in a 2 people store, doable, but if in a 1 person store, impossible.
Advice to Management
Keep the job aligned with the job description. This job description and the actual job is a classic example of the ""Bait and Switch"" technique that retail stores are known for. Teach and train supervision to exhibit the values that CVS stand for (or at least the supervisor I had) and recognize that drugstores will not have a steady flow of new people that WANT to buy, enroll in, sign up for, or whatever term you wish to use, a CarePass. Understand that there will always be people who do not want what you sell no matter what color fur coat you wrap it up in.

During what amount of time, and with what employees are the tasks ever going to get done on time? The pressure is unreal. Whenever there is a meeting to be held, it is always about what the employees need to improve on, rather than telling them what they are doing right, and asking if they need anything.

There needs to be more care and regard towards the employees. The Pharmacist runs the pharmacy and tells the technicians what to do, but don't forget that without the technicians, nothing will get done. The technicians are as essential to the branches as the pharmacists are. Without all of the employees, the business and company will suffer.

Constant hour cuts, while demand continuously rises? It's impossible to truly help people that need it when the corporate eye is only on the profit. Patients want to feel like they are cared about, not just another number getting rushed through.

","Corporate is filled with people who never worked a day of their lives in a pharmacy and you can tell. They set unrealistic quotas while cutting hours during the busiest time of the year (January).
You could work for 7.5 hours and only get a 15 minute break.
This job was not worth the stress or anxiety- there is better paying jobs out there that don't take a toll on your mental and physical health.

","They expect way to much of their store staff, including in the pharmacy. They give us no hours to schedule people to do the work they except of us! The customers lie about everything to corporate and rather than asking what actually happen, some gets fired. (Not me, but other techs). Oh and they pay is not worth the mental and emotional abuse. I’ve been threatened by the customers and the pharmacist didn’t wanna deal with the customer so she just let it happened. And we have too kiss butts to the biggest jerks because they’re the ones that get escalated to the ceo and the customers completely lie about what actually happened. You have to write up and sell narcs to people who are addicted to them or are selling them.
Advice to Management
You make us to all the complaint training, but to shut up annoying customers you let the law slip by. Don’t make your staff do the trainings every 3 months if you’re gonna let the pharmacy due things just to shut someone up. You don’t care about your store staff and it really shows.
