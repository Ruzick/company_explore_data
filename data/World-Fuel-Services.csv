Thu Aug 13 2020, Manager,"Miami, FL",Former Employee ,Goat Rodeo. Big Corporate Arrogance Without the Maturity. Toxic Culture and Hostile Work Environment.,16,"Space Odyssey 2020. Average benefits. Generous PTO. Experience Living in the Twilight Zone in Color.
","Leaders at every level are insecure and spineless due to the ""gotcha"" toxic culture set at the top. They quickly marginalize perceived threats and suppress ideas that run counter to their own to maintain the status quo. Senior leaders are incapable (or unwilling) to connect on a human level due their distrust of others, personal egos, insecurities, jadedness, and/or lack of experience leading at a comparable level within another organization. Result is no inspired leadership .. no camaraderie .. and no collective accomplishments to celebrate. 

Sincerity, genuine empathy, and care of employees is not practiced nor is it valued. HR is non-existent (zero independent contribution) as they are 100% deferential to senior leaders who should not weigh in on so many people decisions as they are not omnipresent. Such decisions should be made by entrusted direct supervisors with input from every person an employee works with, but they are not. HR has the worst tact in engaging individual employees as their only objective is to endear themselves to the senior leaders they work for. They don’t even ask the thousands of employees who have left for feedback! It makes for a miserable place to work when there is no system in place to evaluate based on merit .. solid employees are laid off (without warning) while marginal obedient employees remain and leaders are none the wiser. Board is passive and weak. No diversity .. to be clear, no black people in any position above entry level. Strategy is like looking through a kaleidoscope (great if you’re on LSD, not so great if you're not). Little to no community involvement/presence in Miami/HQ aside from the annual corporate run. 

Maniacal acquirer. They will buy a company only to leave them alone for years, make employees feel inferior by feigning interest in what they do, cut costs, starve them for capital, and then demand growth. Sellers are promised investment and then pushed aside post-sale as their former company languishes/atrophies. I’ve observed leaders use acquired companies as a WeWork space to hold meetings without acknowledging any of the employees there. For all aside from execs, it’s an exhausting 9-5 grind as they are a cog in the wheel. Zero examples of anyone establishing a career. Bully culture fosters back-stabbing and an all-for-one mentality that obliterates morale. 

I’ve witnessed leaders threaten their aged 50+ employees by telling them they can replace them with younger, less costly recent college graduates. Countless times I have witnessed while in their presence, senior leaders speak horribly about employees behind their back on a conference call. No one ever feels pride that they are included but rather shame that they had to bear witness.
Advice to Management
Move on. Management team is tone deaf and lacks employee trust to change. They manage quarter-to-quarter and cut costs with zero fortitude to invest and commit long-term to grow. They can’t change given their advanced age and cozy predicament. 

To be fair, I’m sure those in charge at many, if not all, large publicly traded companies fall short at satisfying all stakeholders … customers, shareholders, and employees. However care of employees (regardless of how slim the margins) is paramount to creating a lasting company. At this place, there is no arbiter of promoting/retaining employees on merit, no rational convicted leader to commit to a strategy and openly communicate, and no trust and sincerity evoked by any leader.

Mon Jun 15 2020, Commercial Operations,,Former Employee ,Racist management,11,"Generous PTO would be the only pro, however a lot people don't get to use their PTO up and they end up losing it because you cannot carry it over.
","Not saying the company as a whole is racist but the commercial operation manager/director in overland park office most definitely is. She has about 25 employees with majority being caucasians working under her yet she choose just the people of color to furlough. Under her team the 3/4 furloughed employees are minorities. So my questions is that, besides the race of the employees, what other indicators were used when choosing who to furlough?
Also might I add, one of the minority employee was fired right after she was furloughed because she got in trouble for taking a zoom call on her bed. Is that a legitimate reason to fire an employee? I'll let you be the judge.
During the entire furlough process, the manager showed no emotions or empathy of any sort. Wouldn't go back to work for this company under any circumstances.
Truly, if you work in this office, there will be no growth. Ask anyone in the company and they can tell you. You're lucky if your department doesn't a mass lay off.

Leaders need to be better trained and equipped in order to develop and engage their employees consistently and honestly. The lack of communication at WFS is a serious challenge. It is also vital that they learn how to provide feedback to employees as this clarifies expectations, helps people learn from their mistakes and builds confidence. In the current state many employees at all levels within the organization are not certain where they really stand with regards to their performance and expectations of such because this is not always clearly discussed or communicated. The company needs a more diverse leadership team that represents its employees fairly. Very few women in leadership and no African Americans on the senior leadership team. They also need Servant leaders at the top. Individuals that are authentic and that serve and represent our communities genuinely. WFS is currently also lacking stronger community involvement which translates into the disconnect with their staff and their families as people want to feel good about where they work.

Some of the best senior sales people in the business. Senior management is trying to make the right changes.
","Region Managers are mostly all from the former companies. The problem is management wants to form a national company, but left all the legacy regional Sales Manager network in the field. Senior Management wants to make the right changes while the local managers want to either retire soon, or remain like the old company they came from. And it does not work for costs or growth. The result is a network like the former Wholesalers who work for themselves, promote themselves, and protect themselves from outsiders as much as possible. If the Sales and support staff want to call out the problem they end up looking for a job, and those in the network promote those who protect them. The ""new"" people (new blood is what the company needs,) find themselves with limited power to change, or if they speak up about problems, they are looking for another job.

Fri Jun 07 2019,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Honest Review - HR,8,"Depending on your manager, you can learn a lot. 

Good work life balance (depending on your manager). 

HR rapport is generally good.
","Culture- CEO is constantly coming up with new projects for HR that always start and never finish. HR has had so many great initiatives that never go anywhere. HR has never had any clear goals which trickle down to HR leadership. 

Culture - HR - HR is very reactionary always putting out fires for leadership. HR is never working on finishing initiatives. No initiatives directly impact employee population in a positive way. I.E. working to get better benefits (work from home policy, maternity leave, overall cost of health insurance). 

HR teams are disbursed and rarely work together well. Different rules depending on manager (IE - some managers allow work from home while others look down upon it). 

Salary- employees with the same titles and job responsibilities have salary ranges that are very far apart ($15k-$20k difference). 

HR leadership does not communicate with HR employees as much as they should. 

Most HR leadership are not tech savvy and have very regressive HR values.
Advice to Management
My advice to HR Leadership is to make time for your actual HR employees instead of focusing on the needs to segment leaders. That is not to say that the needs/goals of the segments are not important. It is to say to focus on the goals of HR as a whole and work on initiatives that will directly impact most of the employee population positively. Most initiatives that do end up getting done only impact employees who directly contribute to the company’s revenue, which is not fair to all other employees. 

Another piece of advice is to start focusing on current HR trends that will directly impact the quickly growing workforce of millennials. Their values are very different than the baby boomer generation. Any fortune 100 company would be preparing for that to stay competitive.

Advice to Management
Ignore this platform and its champions. The people who hide behind the comfort of a screen and rail against this company are the kind of people that cant effect change in the real world, where it matters. They'd rather spend time writing a negative review than take the kinds of risks, both socially and professionally, necessary to impact positive change. People must realize that all systems are made up of individuals; all can effect change. Those who blame leadership fail to take personal ownership of their role within the larger organization. If you expect to waltz into a company where all things are perfect, you are living in a dream world. This company is doing well and will continue to do well. It breeds strong leaders and tough individuals unafraid to challenge the status quo. So, management, I know it would be great to have a higher score on this platform..but honestly, read around. Do we really want people like this on our team? You can keep your stars, but would you close the door on your way out? We're busy helping our customers and stakeholders succeed.

If you expect to waltz into a company where all things are perfect, you are living in a dream world. This company is doing well and will continue to do well. It breeds strong leaders and tough individuals unafraid to challenge the status quo. So, management, I know it would be great to have a higher score on this platform..but honestly, read around. Do we really want people like this on our team? You can keep your stars, but would you close the door on your way out? We're busy helping our customers and stakeholders succeed.

","Boss delegated almost everything so that he had practically nothing to do all day other than chit-chatting and browsing news websites; culture of lots of chiefs and condescension rather than inclusion and respect, especially if not part of management.
Advice to Management
Develop strong talent within and have more respect for hard work ethic, don't let middle-to-senior level managers who get lazy make decisions to eliminate people just because they feel intimidated. Keep your eye on the ball and you won't let good people fall by the wayside. You may need to get rid of fat cats who don't do anything all day yet bear titles of directors and above. You should make your analysts managers quicker, and the directors should be pressed to work more or they should be the ones to lose their job. Develop technology like Chevron where you can see how much time someone spent actually working at their computer or on conferences all day - then you will know objectively (to some degree) who is really pushing out the work and who's just sitting around being lazy.

A good place to start a technology career
","In my opinion very little importance to develop internal leaders….
In my opinion the management is no supporter of hard-working and smart folks….can form opinion when they lay off the team member(s) that delivered projects and products contrary to the team that spent millions and never delivered a proper deliverable…retained because of support or seems like nepotism…. 
Opportunity to improve communication…. My opinion is that there is no thoughtful projects and no check and balance…like remodeling, renting a large area UNDER UTILIZED, wasted on off-shore resources, building systems that never gets used, …no checks? One must ask what was the rational and who/what was benefit? Games? Collaboration? One must ask - Would you spend your own money like this?
Building systems and never used, big turn-off for developers that has put passion and time…
In my opinion loyalty is not in the dictionary and there is no two-way loyalty but expect one way. They let the loyal team members that delivered projects go… undelivered stayed? – game of throne. I believe some has moved out due to lack of profit or influence now. 
My opinion is it is highly politically charged and dog-eat-dog town….either it was business v/s IT or one team v/s another….no collaboration…top leadership is a joke and resolves to manage by conflict...
My opinion is that the TOP leadership is a mediocre…. self-absorbed? democratic-pretext? cultural change? Hire friends/acquaintances…seems like Miami or FL or US doesn’t have architects or senior leaders? 
Management doesn’t trust their managers. Micro managing the people, projects. Opportunistic for facetime to show that they are the BIG-SHOT….some projects/products implemented multiple times with multiple vendor products…hollow promise and still not delivered…doesn’t include the right resources... False promises and wonder if anybody is checking the $$$ spent.

I worked at World Fuel Services full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
You can use if to ""puff"" up your resume by saying you worked for a Fortune 100 company! That's about it.
Cons
OMG where do I even start....! If you are not part of the click you better find another job QUICK! You will be treated like crap IF you are not part of the click. Z-E-R-O work life balance. Expect to work 13-14 hr rotating shifts, nights, weekends, holidays, etc. etc. During the time I worked there in 2010, over 32 employees came and went. Keep in mind that's a VERY small department. You will be ridiculed and mocked in front of ALL other employees if you ever make a mistake. I know of at least 8 people who only lasted 1-3 months because they said they had NEVER worked in a more toxic environment. Seriously, do yourself a favor and apply with UAS, Rockwell Collins, AEG or another Intl. Trip Planning company.

Layoffs happened quickly and many good people who could have helped with the integration process were let go before they could use their knowledge and experience to help.

The company is going through ""transformation"" but what they are doing is firing the REAL workers and leaving the useless garbage of employees to continue running the company, which bleed the company of the salaries that the hard workers deserve. There are a lot of stuck-up individuals that think because they work for a Fortune (used to be 100) company, they think they have the right to look down on everyone else, but clearly they have no education whatsoever. The reputation of this company in South Florida is really negative when it comes to treating their employees and overall work life. There are many managers in the company that take unnecessary trips for training and conferences where is not needed. There are also many managers who come late to work and leave early, and do not perform their functions. You will not get your job done because of meetings all the time. Working there is like going to a dungeon everyday, just look at the turnover rate--employees there last a year, barely! Everyone is so miserable, even the managers and high executive employees. No work-life balance at all, you will be just there taking mistreatments and injustices without being able to defend yourself; and forget about going to HR--they are a joke!!! You will not be heard, you will not be compensated fairly for your labor, you will not be promoted, and you will not be taken into account. DO NOT WORK for this company!

","CEO is a former bunker fuel trader that no one ever imagined becoming CEO of a Fortune 100 Company. Incoming Managers have little or no Management experience. Company is buying very small energy companies while letting go of hundreds of people to falsely simulate growth. Spending and expenses are out of control. Company has no common CRM system so no one knows our Customers. Pretending everything is fine and will improve won't make anything better.
Advice to Management
Remember that hope is not a strategy. Hire talented Directors, VPs and SVPs instead of friends of friends. Focus on core competencies - instead of trying to boil the ocean. Saying "" we've always done things this way "" improves nothing - as the market changes quickly - but you do not (as reflected in the stock price). Treat people like human beings - the way you would want to be treated. Lying to people accomplished nothing.

Sat Sep 02 2017, Customer Sympathy Provider,,Former Employee ,CORPORATE 'RETREAT',14,"Nice, glossy brochure with big words.
","If this leviathan buys out your employer...RUN...and don't look back. I worked for a locally owned, very successful energy company whose owner did a fine job of nurturing a corporate culture based on mutual respect, professionalism, and a 'customer first' philosophy. We had our problems, but nothing that was insurmountable. Along comes WFS their deep pockets, and within a matter of months, they had eradicated any semblance of our culture, and ruined the fine legacy established by the previous ownership. I have never seen morale decline as fast as it did there - never, ever believe it when new owners say ""nothing's going to change"", because everything does, and none of it for the good.
The worst thing about WFS is how it loves to layer on the management, yet no one in the organization could figure out who was in charge. This company loves to have meetings, yet for all of the talk, nothing ever happens, nor are problems solved . One has to go through so many levels to accomplish anything, it's a wonder our customers ever saw their product. And speaking of customers, the company is losing them-as well as its employees-in equal, frightening measure.
I got out while the getting was good, and have stayed in the industry. They (WFS) would be-and should be-appalled at the number of their customers who are contacting my new employer (as well as other players in the industry), desperate to change providers, in the interest of better service.
Advice to Management
Clean house at the (local) senior level, and start over, especially in Operations. Put someone in charge who knows how to lead, has decent communication skills, and who is a people person. Hire more worker bees, but fewer managers. Most importantly: take care of your customers, because they are the ones funding your fat paychecks.

The work shifts are extremely long, often lasting between 12-14 hours (sometimes 16) a day/night while dealing with dangerous chemicals and some of the worst traffic in the nation. This company will work you to death. We often don't get to see our families or have much of a home life. It can literally suck the life out of you. Finally, there have been shady incidents (I would almost go as far to say borderline illegal) concerning lower management, as well.

No state income tax. wait one more ... beautiful people (quite different from those weather-worn Northeasterners). Come here for a year or two to enjoy the lifestyle then move on for your health and well-being!
","This place will leave you in a catatonic state! You join, work hard for a year or two (or six) all the while keeping hope alive that career advancement is on the horizon, then .. wait for it .. you get numb from doing the same routine tasks over and over (and the commute to/from Doral-zuela), that pay raise never happens (others less deserving receive promotions out of cycle while you get your annual review/comp bump via email). You find yourself trying yoga, working out 2x a day, taking multiple coffee breaks to cope but nothing works. You then get a new boss (who like previous ones) gives you the robot-speech that you are valuable, there is upside, commit to the team, etc, but by now there is no belief ... you have officially entered the ""burn-out zone"" and now have become a marginal contributor. 

Actual work and peer/superior evaluations are subordinate to kissing up, responding to emails in 2min or less, tenure at WFS, and what grad school you went to (in that order).

This place is soulless. For most it's a job and not a career, and that's unfortunate!

","Promotions are not merit based but rather depend on personal relationships with management. So if you want to move up you have to suck up

Many middle managers whos responsibilities do not match up with their ability (due to first problem)

Inability to incorporate strategic thinking to solving issues/challenges. A lot of times decisions are based on most senior person in room's opinion on what needs to be done rather than leveraging team's input or listening to those with the most experience. Thus many decisions are ego based

Spaghetti infrastructure that is fragmented and inefficient just like senior management. Basic questions around market risk, PnL and PnL can not be answered or takes hours to pull together if at all

Management has little knowledge or awareness of the embedded operational risk the firm is carrying given the inept leaders, bad processes and inability to properly leverage the systems they have over invested in

They do not care about their employees and like to fire a lot of them right before bonuses are paid out to save a little money

Women are constantly being hit on by senior management as are guys. Its a strange place to work in that respect. 


Managers promise promotion and when the time comes for annual reviews deny ever promising anything

Wed Mar 23 2016,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,The worst.,6,"A few good people among the horrible culture. But it's a rarity.
","The IT department is a place that's stuck in about 1990. They still have a heavy reliance on the waterfall development model, and are extremely deadline driven. Nobody cares about software quality, only about pushing software through the hoops at the expense of quality so they can look good because they met their own deadline. Deadlines are paramount, and this is pushed by senior management above all else. Then everything breaks and nobody seems to connect these two obvious points. The same can be said for the IT support where there's constant chaos, and massive failures are a daily occurrence. It's so permeated the culture they think this is normal. (Google Normalization of Deviance to understand this more broadly)

The environment is extremely siloed and the culture encourages everyone to avoid any blame whatsoever. People work extremely long hours because the company believes in under-staffing to the extreme. The biggest problem at World is simply they've grown far faster than they can keep up with and don't understand they can't keep doing this. This won't change anytime soon.

Employees in IT are extremely diss-empowered. Everything is driven by policy, with a top down management style. The corporate firewall blocks useful things like youtube (Why yes, there's learning material on youtube!) as a matter policy.

","The IT dept is run by a dictatorship. Very few of IT management think for themselves. The work load is intensive and unrealistic. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt it's because of the fast growth. They burn out the hard workers and don't recognize them for their work. There are many slackers within the company (some old employees and newly joined) who continue with a standard < 40 hour work week when others are putting in 50-65 hours a week. They have a gift of trying to look busy and take credit for other peoples work. Sharing of knowledge is rare. It's something you have to earn from your peers. I understand why though. The hard workers put in lot of personal time to understand the business and learn the systems. Any time they take away from their workload, is extra time they need to put in later. 
Promotion within only goes so far. They will promote you to a lead position but that's as far as it will go and it's only a title change. You will still perform the same job. Any type of management position is hired from the outside. I've never seen so many re-orgs in my life.

He offers no skills which would allow him to assist with the work load and expects everyone to stroke his ego. Very disappointed executives have not taken action.

Some Managers choose to pick on certain members of staff, whilst choosing to ignore the faults in other members of the team. The bosses further up the line are too busy scoffing at each other, they are failing to see the hard work that the mere minions are putting in (really this should be recognised as they wouldn't get their big bonuses if it wasn't for them!).

","Absolutely shocking. Dinosaur management who just talk corporate waffle! Bosses are old fashioned with no fresh ideas and are trying to role out a failed business model from Certas. Completely reliant on a new delivery system as if it the holy grail! Whilst your patting each other on the back your customers are walking away. 

“We don’t want to be the biggest, We want to be the best”

They are very 'hire them, fire them' and have an exceptionally high staff turnover apart from a few old stalwarts who seem to cling on for some reason. I must have seen about 40% of the staff change in the time I was there.
