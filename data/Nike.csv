Wed Jan 13 2021, Lead Product Owner,"Beaverton, OR",Current Employee ,Chilled out culture and employees but tech processes are behind industry standards,1,"I work in the Global Technology group. Easy going, forgiving culture. Plenty of head count redundancy. Work I would do by myself at my former employer is done by 4-5 heads at Nike. Makes for great work life balance. Just getting your job done leads to kudos - feels like you get a medal for showing up. Even better if you can talk up your work and make the right noises in front of upper management.
","Processes and tools not up to industry standards. Practices like Agile Scrum that I had adopted 10 years ago are adopted in name only. No rigor in processes leading to waste. Teams work in silos and may or may not bring in other teams impacted by a solution or new process - you are left to 'find out' or figure it out. No structures exist for a robust cross team sharing of pertinent information. Teams staffed by large number of contract workers cannot be bothered to share across teams. Leads to design misses/poorly designed solutions and production defects.
Advice to Management
Catch up with the industry in terms of technical processes.
Stopping staffing teams with contractors who are focused only on the immediate solution and don't have the long term view in mind.
Promote an open culture where tough conversations are encouraged, and empower employees to hold each other accountable.

Used to have fun events and off-sites, but a lot of that is no longer part of Nike.
","VERY political, make sure you get a manager who likes you and or actually cares about you.
Lots of gossip.
Very tops down culture, what leadership says, goes. Don't really listen to people who are doing the work. I made a suggestion a few months after I was first hired, three years later they start on that same track of work, because ""leadership identified it"".
Pay is so so, just above others in the industry in Portland, have to make director to make good money.
Saw a lot of good leaders let go because they didn't meet the new diversity and inclusion matrix that were established recently.
You tend to have to do things because upper management asks for them, regardless if they truly add value or not, then you'll stop doing them after a couple months, then start doing them again etc... spend hours a week doing it just to learn it's so leadership could see info in an easier format...
Advice to Management
Actually listen to employees (don't just do an annual all employee survey and say there will be change). Stop the top down culture, actually look at who does good work and reward that, not the people who play the political games.
Invest in LEADERS who motivate people to do their best and shield them from the busy work asks that come from the top down.

A culture that does value individuality...as long as you're a team player. Casual, but faced paced environment, There's no place like Nike in many ways.
Part of the ""good old days"" where Nike celebrated it's people and rewarded hard work.
","People aren't set up to be great leaders and are often promoted because ""who they know"" and how they manage up, even if Nike tried to change that in light of bad PR a few years ago. 
Nike is SO big it often gets in it's own way, inefficient processes and the matrixed environment slow things down so much. Sometimes you have to socialize things with 10 directors just to move forward to the next step, and by then you've either lost funding or there's a new priority out, so you just wasted you're time. 
Extremely competitive. 
Every few years, senior leadership changes so much that many priorities and process shift completely, just as you're finally getting used to one way of operating. That is exhausting and you can never feel fully on top of it all as often times, you're stretched thin and so is your team.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees who DO THE WORK. Set them up for success by providing actual leadership, so they have examples to learn from. 
Invest in your people, truly, and not just online courses and a once a year survey that literally accomplishes nothing other than making your senior leaders come down on you.

Advice to Management
For a company that profits billions per year, and only losing a few million during the pandemic, if it was so necessary to cancel raises for the people at the bottom of the totem pole that are struggling, upper management should have taken a pay cut. You cancelled raises the same time you cancelled hazard pay. We are exhausted from this pandemic, and the company seems to have given up on us. They claim that free lunch and free breakfast take the place of getting a raise, but I don't care about food when I cannot afford a place to even live.

Cons
Cliques (as in any other job). high retention rate means you have to put in years (over 2 or 3) before being considered for a full time position. If you’re looking for a full time job or to get eventually promoted, this job will take longer. If you’re a student, then this job is great to balance with school.

- Great benefits, even for part-time workers (including insurance, discounts, etc.)

- Experienced and kind coworkers who were helpful as I was learning the ropes
","- Can be tough to receive time off during holidays (similar to most retail)
- Can be difficult to remember all of the information about each of Nike's many products 
- Customer engagement style was the type where you had to greet every customer and frequently check-in; this style sometimes annoyed customers who wanted to shop without being bothered/sometimes difficult to keep track of who has greeted who, leading to more customer frustration
Advice to Management
- Whatever process is being used to find managers, keep using it! At my store, managers led by example; were always on their athlete's side (not in fighting customers per se, but by trusting what the athlete had to say about a situation); and were never unavailable or locked in an office.

","I started here super optimistic to be working for one of the most recognizable brands in the world. The experience has only gone downhill. I had a great manager who advocated for me and was my champion. Despite that, and several years of stellar performance reviews, HR would not heed my manager’s recommendation for advancement. This situation was not unique to my position as several of my peers still face this challenge after being high performers for serval years. Advancement and promotion here is a complete mystery. They do not invest in their talent nor see people as their most valuable asset. Discarded at random, during good times, your job will never be safe at this company. Leadership is nonexistent in this place, which is so contradictory for a company that prides itself on team and inclusion. Don’t be fooled. NIKE is a master manipulator and expert image crafter. Internally, moral has never been lower as we close in on month 5 of the largest layoff in history. We’re not even laying off people because business is hurting - we’re laying of people because our executive team built an org that was too big - and now those people who had nothing to do with creating the “matrix”- our internal organization - are paying for it. So top line:
- no advancement / career growth
- systemic lack of leadership 
- does not value people
- layoffs every 3 years (in good times)
- masters of manipulation (internal and external)
Advice to Management
- Put people first. Understand what it means to be a leader and study how military leadership works: sacrifice / selflessness / humility / honor. 
- Get in touch with your people and their morale. Especially in WFH 
- Check your priorities: if you take care of your people first. They will take care of the company. Which will take care of the stock price. Which will take care of the shareholders. Not the other way around

I can say that they certainly do care about their staff and they try and give you as many resources to help you and they are very understanding of work/life balance. It's not the job that's hard, as a matter of fact, the job itself isn't hard at all and can sometimes pose as fun, depending on the day and crowd at the store.
","Management can either make or break your experience. Our head coach is amazing, she made her expectations for Nike employees very clear since day 1 and she upholds those values and standards. With that being said, some of the Head Coaches sometimes may not be on the same page when it comes to operations and rules or guidelines. Managers may be understanding of one situation, while head coaches lack proper communication and understanding of that same situation. It's a great job don't get me wrong, but head coaches perform very little to none in their day to day shifts and often aren't able to modify how they coach individual employees.

","Bro culture that emphasizes cliques, jock behavior and ""in crowd"" status over delivered results is a business weakness. Individuals who talk a good game or get protection from a powerful-enough executive will do just fine; if you hope to succeed based on delivering positive business results yourself--you're probably in the wrong company. I was advised by a senior leader to ""be the fun little sister"" in order to succeed. Sigh.... Some talk is happening about addressing this cultural problem, but it's built into the DNA of the company and will be hard to overcome. For many poc and women, it's an uphill climb.
Advice to Management
Drive the business using data, not tenure or buddy relationships. Take a hard look at spend/performance and demand executive accountability (no one gets a pass for bad performance even though he's someone's friend). If this had been the approach for the past years, the company would be in a better position to weather the current COVID crisis. There is much hope with the new executive team, and I wish them well.

Therefore, the vast majority of employees are unqualified for the positions they hold. A lot of favoritism, and huge amount of arrogance, especially among the younger employees who act as though they are in a sorority or fraternity. Nike claims to be ""diverse,"" however, they do not support the LGBT+ community, they just take advantage around Pride month for profit, like most major companies. Pay is also substantially below market because you are working for a huge name. If you meet someone new, and they work at Nike, they'll be sure to let you know within the first 30 seconds of meeting them. An extremely corrupt company and so glad I now work for a company that actually pays what employees deserve, and is truly diverse. Screw you Nike!!

Wed Feb 19 2020, Sales Athlete,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Decent Retail Job,0,"Pros are that they do emphasize on bringing premium service to the consumer. 
Direct deposit every 2 weeks and they pay your training that they refer to as RTC or Rookie Training Camp as well as any training or store meeting which is pretty early hours. You'll love coming to work to see your co-workers and some consumers make your day when you're able to talk to them on slow days. Management can definitely improve on deferring from favoritism and only picking on those who are not. They can also work on having the leads actually contribute to the sales floor and not just micromanage or walking around ordering people to do minimal tasks they're capable of. They're big on receiving feedback referred to as pulse shout outs which are then read out loud the following day so make sure you make an effort to give good service and get recognized by the consumer filling that survey out. They also do tend to use gift cards and food or additions to the break room as incentives to win contests such as being the store that sells the most gift cards during holiday season or who can keep up perfect attendance meaning punch in on time and be on the floor ready on time. This is a great job for students and people who are hesitant on retail because I found this retail job to be less strenuous than what I heard most retail jobs are and a decent pay. You get to say you work for NIKE which is a great accomplishment seeing their applications and interview hiring process is competitive.
","Again, favoritism plays a big role depending on which store you are at. As much as they emphasize on premium service, they are always either out of sizes or don't sell the merchandise consumers come in. You'll get reprimanded by the coaches or leads if you come in with dirty sneakers, not the right uniform or if you're not in the zone you're assigned. Really hard to grow and stand out in retail if you want to grow within the company. Again, it's about favoritism over professionalism in some stores. Seems to be more geared towards sneaker culture and folks who want to use their employee discount to get some new sneakers and less on the sports/athlete environment.
