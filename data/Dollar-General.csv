Advice to Management
If I were a manager I would hold team meetings to get everyone on the same page. When you set endcaps and pogs so often items come in on the truck and most employees aren't aware of the locations so either you spend a lot of time looking for locations or those things go into overstock because they don't fit in the original location. A weekly meeting before truck or biweekly meeting to update employees would save a lot of time and money.

Thu Dec 24 2020, Assistant Manager,"Philadelphia, PA",Former Employee ,Surveys set up Managers for failure,1,"Most folks are wonderful to work with and benefits are not bad at all.
","Surveys are a huge failure on the Corporate side of things. As they are designed to setup the stores and their managers for fail. Which in turn affects their wages. To define this; if you get a survey for anything less that a highly satisfied (which is a 5 star rating); your store gets a zero and it takes two highly satisfied to cancel out one bad rating (a four star). Yes, so even a four star rating (satisfied) is a zero. And this is a major stress for managers as it goes against their wages during their yearly evaluations.
Advice to Management
Get real, and break down that 5 star rating into percentages; not this dreadful 100 percent for highly satisfied and a zero for anything under. Really, how does that even give you a good sense of how any particular store is really performing; except to cheat its managers out of wages increases.

No actual benefits besides a few discounts on the DG app that happen maybe weekly or monthly (not worth my time imo)
For a simple job, DG makes it quite stressful. Not enough workers, not even pay for doing various roles while trying to keep customers happy, long hours that cut into the middle of the day, leaving you with little time. Plus, side perk (sarcasm), random days with no simplified schedule.
The amount of stress this job provides does not show up on my paycheck. Having to stock, recover, and check out customers quickly with a line and only 1 other person (who usually has other tasks on their plate) makes this very simple and easy job a pain and creates stress.
Dead end job. Being a store manager isn't worth it. Transfer to another store. Lose the title and pay. Stay as manager, lose time with family and still not enough pay.
Advice to Management
You don't pay me enough to care. For an 8 billion dollar generating corporation who calls being short by $2 reason for termination, I see the blame falls mostly on the employees when the company loses 7 million in profit (of 8 billion) when it comes to employees. That's not accounting for stolen items/snacks which often occur. DG cares more about stopping unions (um, pay us more?) and diversity. Instead of trying to look good on the outside, fix the inside of the company by providing liveable wages to your lower employees. Most everyone working is already on foodstamps unless they have an alternative source of income.

Stop blaming everything on your employees. There is only so much negative reinforcement you can put on a person before they leave. Don't lie to new employees. They will resent you more in the end. Stop trying to motivate people with goals something always goes wrong and we have to work anyway. There are only so many times you can promise a person a day off before they just hate you for it. Find a way to help your long time employees who are starting to struggle. They are finding it hard to care anymore and are probably about to quit. If you hired convicts you would probably find people who can actually stand the mindlessness of the job

","The amount of work that gets pushed onto a reliable worker kills. A cashier will soon get the responsibilities of a manager,/store manager especially if yours is lazy.

","Family time is obsolete, hiring pool is non existent, not enough hours to keep the store cleaned AND stocked, and they care more about making money than sticking up for their employees. 500 customers a day but ""there are no resets that week"" so we are only going to give you enough coverage to have 1 cashier for half the day. Everything is thought up by pencil pushers who have never worked a day in the stores (with the workers salary). They say ""its scientific from tests done with numbers"" but don't take into consideration that every person is different and every store runs different. Managers are mandatory 6 days a week 48 hours MINIMUM to be worked. No time for family. They switched to a ""fresh truck"" so no more cold/frozen vendors. Trucks NEVER show up when they are supposed to. Cold trucks have only a PARTIAL amount of product that your store will need so everything is always empty no matter how many times you scan and make sure your inventory numbers are correct in the system. Dry truck shows up whenever it feels like. Have a ""flex"" store? Don't expect to get on any type of consistent schedule. The ONLY thing consistent with this company is inconsistencies. They put policies into place for the well being of the workers and customers, but then say dont dispute any customers who doesn't want to follow them. Dog that isn't a service dog? On the door in TINY letters it says not allowed. Customer brings one in? Don't follow corporate policy or federal law of no animals where food is sold. You HAVE to let them do their shopping because God forbid you get a bad survey. Which BTW, you get a bad surveys and you end up on a DAILY conference call at 6 am over your stores ""bad customer service""....smh...if you are considering this company, DO NOT have children at home or any type of family commitments. They will mean NOTHING when you sign up for this job. Then there is the ""BIG DOG"" sales club. They lump ALL stores into one category. Our particular district has 1 DG+. they are CONSTANTLY getting praise for how well their sales are....well of COURSE their sales are better. They are twice the size and have 3 times as many products as the other smaller stores. Each different type of store should have their OWN categories. So it makes you feel like crap because you know you will NEVER be #1 in sales in any competition even though you meet sales and/exceed sales expectations time and time again according to their ""mathematics"" from the pencil pushers up at the top who have never actually worked a store in their life. My honest opinion is ALL the people from the regional managers up should have to work a FULL YEAR in the bottoms with us ""peons"" with OUR crappy pay before they are allowed to make ANY decisions for any stores. And they shouldn't go to just any store either. They need to go to the stores with the lowest sales and highest theft rates to REALLY figure out what we deal with on a daily basis.
Advice to Management
Stop trying to expand when you cant even get your current stores properly stocked and have your feet of trucks constantly breaking down and half our merchandise not showing up. Make you regional managers and above ""prove"" themselves by working in the worst stores in the company for an ENTIRE YEAR with OUR salary and not a penny more before they can make ANY corporate decision and stop with the stupid surveys. Fine, if they call corporate to make a complaint, send it to the store and have them prove they resolved the issues. Those surveys ARE NOT accurate. 99% are being done by employees just so they don't get in trouble for having their scores drop and risk getting in trouble with the district and regional managers. Store floors aren't shiny? Oh no! That store manager must not be doing their job!!! Even tho that manager just took over and the store was in so disarray that it took everything they had not to have a mental breakdown while trying to fix the store piece by piece.

Sat Oct 24 2020, Associate,,Current Employee ,HYPOCRITICAL TRAING VS WORKING EXPECTATIONS,1,"The local customers are the best
","The training videos they make you watch (CBL's) and take quiz during are not what they tell you to do on the floor. Training tells cashiers not to go farther than 30 feet from register and to greet every customer that comes in, which is great. In real life they want you to be out on the floor stocking with a minimum roll trainer completion per hour. While doing that you have to continuously keep stopping and going to see if there is a customer at the register ""every couple of minutes"". Customers have inquired numerous times why isn't there a bell type thing they could bring. We were told that is a huge NO on that one. Regardless how busy the register is you are expected to stock a certain # of roll trainers per hour, if you don't then you get written up. If you stock the way you are trained in videos it takes alot longer and not as much product gets stocked. They push for quantity, regardless of videos. 
If they would have more than 2 people a shift on weekends more work could get done. Corporate does the ordering, not the store, which means there is always a ton of stuff in the back room that there is nowhere to put it. It could go on and on. 
Employees are not appreciated and have no incentive to do a great job.
Advice to Management
It would be a good idea to start showing your employees some appreciation. Your expectations versus the payroll hours are nowhere close at all. If the stores could order their own truck overstock would be so much lower.
Every store is different and has different needs. Before you add more services it would be a good idea to take a look and see what is and is not working at the stores. 
Quit being cheap on payroll hours. This company takes in more than enough money every year. The least you could do is pass on a little appreciation to the people that actually make it run and do all the work.

","Do your homework if you're considering a job here. There is review after review about how bad it is to work here. As a DM you are expected to work ""24-7"". Store teams are not given enough labor and if stores get behind, DM's are expected to cover the slack. Sales are higher than ever and labor hours are less than ever even though tasks have improved. Unsafe working conditions, stores in disrepair without basic repairs. Lowest wages make hiring good employees impossible - DG hires people who can't get hired anywhere else.

Have a 7 day workflow which if used is a well oiled system.
Decent pay for a person starting in retail for store manager.
Above average bonus system.
","Pending on area high turnover will take away a chunk of payroll as training hours are part of the stores payroll budget.
In order to work their 7 day system as a store manager you must at minimum work half of all 1600 pc trucks in 1 and a half days. Or run a register and hire someone to work the freight.
Payroll is not reflective of current sales. If you are up 30% you will not get extra payroll for that 30% sales increase.
Due to minimum staffing if you have callouts you will have to cover as they do not want overtime used which means you could EASILY work 7 days a week and 70+ hours based on staffing issues that are pretty common to occur.

Wed Oct 07 2020, Lead Sales Associate/Key Holder,,Current Employee ,"Exausting and Overworked, been working for over 3 years here. It is about time i find another company.",2,"-Good handful of respectable customers/regulars

-Easy to get a job here

-Weekly pay

-Yearly raise(Needs to be more, my co-worker has been working at location for 7 years and isn't even making $10/h yet)

-Highly depends on your location, but mine has a good, respectable team

-Covid-19 protection is half-way decent. They installed sneeze-screens and employees are required to wear masks. Though (con) they gave us MORE to do because we need to sanitize the carts and baskets over and over throughout the day, and every night before close we have to sanitize high-touch areas.

-Veriety of locations that are close to home(which can also be a con because they keep opening up new locations so close to older ones, wasting money when they could just pay the current location more and add more staff or make it bigger.)
","-Covid-19, Customers are ""Required""(meaning in no way can we do something if they don't wear a mask, which a massive handful of customers don't wear a mask and many of them complain when we ask t hem to wear one) to wear masks.

-Covig-19 They gave us MORE to do because we need to sanitize the carts and baskets over and over throughout the day, and every night before close we have to sanitize high-touch areas.

-'Clopens' Where an employee is scheduled to close the store and turn around and open it in the morning(This should NEVER happen. but it happens often)

-They keep opening up new locations so close to older locations instead of paying the current staff more, or giving them more bodies on a daily basis.

-Regulars such as avid couponers, penny shoppers, and the frequent angry customer that has no reason to be angry.

-Non-consistent hours. Sometimes you get sub 12, other times you get almost 40. For part-time.

-Low hourly-wage. 

-Starting wage is minimum-wage.

-Doing everything, multi-tasking. Too much responsibility for low-pay.

-Continue to load more work onto the employee's plate with no raise in pay(Fed-ex drop-off point, and DG-pickup for examples)

-Management is out-of-touch with day-to-day operations.

-Machines barely work a lot of the times. Very unreliable

-Working solo for hours on end some days, even during peak times

-Upper management complaining when things don't get done; when we don't even have enough help to get day-to-day things done.

-No real recognition for good work

-Very long work days sometimes(9-10h/day) Very exausting

-Hold onto ""customer is always right"" So we can't do much about the obviously wrong customers

-Customer surveys are the holy bible to upper management. An angry customer gives a bad review? its the store's fault according to upper management.

-Customer surveys are 5star completely satisfied=good, 4-0star=0 score.

-Company cares more about customer relations than employee health and safety.

-Standing all day

-Breaks are unpaid(meaning if you work 8 hour paid shift you are there for an extra hour, unpaid. Because you can't leave your associate alone..)

-Breaks aren't free time like they should be

-No benefits for part-timers even when they get a constant 30+hours/week.

-Not a living-wage
Advice to Management
-Raise the hourly wage

-3 employees at ALL times except when closing(3rd employee on shift should leave at 10 so the last 2 close)

-Need less responsibilities. There is way too much for a skeleton crew to do in a day-to-day basis.

-Need proper metrics AKA: stop hounding the SM because our store surveys are down from last weeks. Customers will not do them for the most part unless they are angry or have something superb to say. The average customer will NOT do the survey as they are just in to buy their things and carry on with their life. We are needing to beg our good regular customers to do the surveys or fake the surveys ourselves just to hit the metric.

-Start treating your employees more like you treat the bad customers and turn-over would diminish; i'm saying treat them good and they would appreciate it

-Stop giving us more work and then complaining when recovery isn't done 100% every night. We can't get to recovery because you gave us all these other tasks to do.

Pay your employees more. Even part-time employees have a life they are trying to live. Your company surely has enough funds considering you keep opening new stores every 5 miles. Take more time to consider your employees versus how much more burden you put on yourselves with so many stores.

They pay is good but it averages out to minimum wage if you do the math on how much you actually work with all the hours you need to put in. As store manager I was by myself in the store on register till 3pm at least four days a week. you'll never receive enough help to complete everything with the payroll given. Even when sales are up no additional payroll is given which makes zero sense. Just trying to up their margin without thinking about store impact, terrible business decisions.

","Only two people in the store at a time
Unreasonable expectations
More and more responsibilities to make even more unreasonable expectations
You'll never feel fulfilled. You can never put away the overstock before another truck comes in giving you more overstock.
Nothing will be done about the store's issues, even when a district manager physically visits your store.
Advice to Management
Hire more people. There should not be two people in the store at a time. There should be more. It compromises employee safety, let's customers get away with many things such as stealing and harassment, makes it so nothing is accomplished that is asked of us in a day, and stacks unreasonable expectations on just one person. I've had to put away the fresh truck all by myself on multiple occasions while I'm due for a mandatory hour break, meanwhile I'm expected to finish 4 rolltainers, and take care of customers (since i'm the only one there) at the register on a busy weekend. This could easily be fixed if they hired people to stock and people to cashier separately. That way a key holder can finish all the daily tasks and finish planograms without worrying about the 30+ rolltainers. A lot of them not fitting in the backroom, so they have to fill THREE aisles and the back wall on the SALES FLOOR. This is happening in almost every rural Dollar General in my area within 50-60 miles. I know this because people from my store had to help other stores because there were so few people working there that they couldn't keep up (and we weren't even able to keep up with our own), and those stores also had to help us. So maybe? Maybe pay more attention to the stores and actually solve these issues. I've worked there for two years and I wish I had quit a year sooner. Also, for all these responsibilities, you are underpaying lead sales associates and assistant managers. I could've been making twice the amount working somewhere else just stocking. I think it's insane that they're adding even more responsibilities like online pick up. That's physically impossible for the store I was working at. Right now, the truck can't even get in because there's two cargo cars taking up the space right in front of where the truck usually parks, and it was already tight to begin with. And it's going to be impossible to pick those things back up again because the whole place is covered in empty rolltainers that the trucks are late to pick up. Meanwhile, all 6+ people I worked with in the past year have already quit, and nobody is staying for more than 2 months. Best of luck, Dollar General. Just remember- not every store is running as well as your Kentucky and southern stores. A lot of them are suffering because you see that your most cared for and original stores are able to take on the responsibilities you create, but every other store can't, and you're looking away.

I routinely was left by myself on truck day, which required me to leave the front, check in truck in back room , go up into the truck itself to view merch, and come back into the store to a line of angry customers. The majority of the time you will be alone in the store except for the last 4 hours because you are technically not allowed to close alone.

Increase the payroll budget for the Marksville store. You only have 4 people running that store, this is making loss prevention a completely impossible task.

Wed Aug 26 2020, Heavy Equipment Operator,,Former Employee ,Please; do not work at the DC.,1,"There is literally not one benefit for working at their distribution center.
Well no. They take safety pretty seriously. This is a big thing.
","Too many to list here; but here goes:
Was lied to about rate of pay.
-was hired at 16.45+ and verified by multiple supervisors. -pay stub said 13.95

dishonesty and disrespect 
-was given the run around while there whenever questions about job duties or compensation came up.

Straight up was lied to in order to get me on board.
- was told that in addition to the shift diff., I would also get an additional $2 hourly bonus due to Covid. This did not happen. In reality, every other pay check, the company issues you $2 per hour worked, only up to 40 hours, which is THEN taxed as a gift; leaving the employee with a measly $10-25/ per two weeks.

ALSO was told I would be hired with a sign on bonus. HOWEVER. It is actually a Retention bonus; only receiving parts of it over the course of 4 months. (They tell you 90 days but you don’t get it until two weeks after each 30 day period)

And Bonus!!! The signing bonus check are all taxed individually as gifts as well!! (Ps tax of gift checks are MORE than you regularly pay income taxes.
So $1000= (250 - gift tax) + (250 - gift tax) + (500 - gift tax)

Next; the straight up will lie to you. As an employer, they will look into your eyes as you begin and tell you things just to get you into the door and actively shame people who have left. I cannot stress this enough

THIS IS A TOXIC COMPANY.

Oh and there is more!
They WILL straight up STEAL from you. What I mean is this. I personally went in to work x amount of hours, over the course of x amount of days. I am/was strapped for cash, so I maintained what hours I worked and when. After looking at my pay stub, not only was my pay rate several dollars off, but I was put down as working LESS THAN HALF of the hours I was there.
I am a productive person and avid student. There was not a minute of wasted time while I was at the DC. However, I was only paid for less than a 3rd of the hours worked. For reference, I worked 26 hours; my pay stub only has 6 hours on it.

Miscommunication was also a big con. While there are instances I feel that the misleading was purposeful; there was even more information that was wrong because no one really knew the answer: most would just tell you something that they thought was right (hopefully at least TRYING to help) however the lack of a standard of information was evident.
Advice to Management
Set a standard and ensure every one on your management team tie the same line.

Use 3-2-2-3 schedule for DC employees instead of having everyone work 5-7 days a week 10-14 hour shifts. (Not only is that not sustainable but it’s also MORE expensive!! You will have less burnout and less of a turnover rate if you did this.)

Do not lie to new hires!!! This one seems pretty obvious..

Pay your employees! (Bonus for paying them what you say you would pay them!!)

Aside from your safety rules-
 (which, I have to say the safety of the DC was the only thing that impressed me. It was really nice to see how serious everyone took being safe!!)
-Please pull your company out of the stone ages; there were a few rules in place that only seemed to have a benefit of being there, if you want compliance without reason- carry on- but if you want to have engaged team members; please update your employee handbook and some of the rules enforced.

Mon Aug 17 2020, Shift Supervisor,"Scottsville, KY",Former Employee ,"An Embarrassingly Run, Poorly Managed Facility",2,"For the exception of a few, the employees are incredibly hard working.
","To say that the Scottsville distribution facility is an unmitigated disaster, is to understate just how truly terrible this execrable place was, and is. Whether it was the managers treating associates like chattel, the unsafe work conditions, or the toxic cultural environment, there’s little that can be said to even attempt to salvage this squalid excuse for a warehouse. 
It’s utterly shameful how associates were handled, from forcing them to spray trailers with a neuro-toxin that was just handed to them without research (or the OSHA recommended PPE), to managers who routinely called them “entitled, thieving, white trash”, it was simply flabbergasting how they treated actual human beings, like soulless machines. Lunch breaks were 30 minutes in length for 12-hour shifts, and the nearest break rooms were a 10-minute walk from the heart of the facility, meaning lunches were brief, and the work tedious. 
The facility itself was disgusting. Rodents infested the dry goods area, and dust and debris littered the aisles and cartons. Every now and again a health inspector would show up, but HR would radio to the floor to stop all operations to clean, while they delayed the agent in the conference rooms with presentations. For the fall candy push (which begins in July), cooler cases are brought in from the yard, which are often filled with mice, snakes, and even racoons, before encapsulating children’s candy without sanitation.
The failure of HR to adequately staff this facility meant that team members often pulled double duty, and first and second shifts ran back to back for months on end, even going to six and seven days a week due to the inability of the Director to be clear about the dire condition of his workforce. Beyond that, the managers, who are wholly incompetent, drive to the daily quota, without actually managing things, “hit the number” is their creed, even if there aren’t the personnel to do it. 
These individuals are perhaps the worst aspect of this location, as they helm a culture where incompetence is enabled, so long as loyalty is preserved. Individuals on light duty for work related injuries are given humiliating details such as holding a stop sign in a yellow vest, to encourage EPJ drivers to slow down. 
When a female representative enters the facility, the radio will often squawk with a call for others to come and stare. One manager who was terminated for unrelated reasons, used to personally escort the medical equipment rep around, as he thought she was ‘hot’. He also took pictures of female associates when they weren’t looking, something that was widely known but never punished. They furthermore referred to their Latin American staff members as “Mexicans” or “Illegals”.
Managers not only were aware of this, they actively engaged in it. Day to day they would zip around in golf carts expressing their frustration, while failing to render assistance in fixing the identified issues. In a facility where employment was a constant problem, and where 1.75 people were fired for every 1 brought onboard, they would “point” associates for being a couple minutes late, having doctor’s appointments, or needing unpaid time off. They would also enforce production quotas that were never tested by those performing the job. The standard was off, but we fired people nonetheless for their failure to perform. 
In one particularly disheartening instance, the managers mocked an older associate who was overweight and disheveled for being ‘poor’ in private, before firing him for his failure to hit his numbers. “I’ll take him out for a beer” one ‘leader’ said, “well you’re going to have to pay after today” the other ‘leader’ replied. They then proceeded to joke about how he wouldn’t have to foot the bill at all, as no bar would allow them in with all the holes that riddled this poor man’s shirt
The team member cried when I escorted him from the building. 
The list of problems with this location are too numerous to cite, but my time there taught me more about toxic leadership than any of my 20 years prior in the same field. They are systemic from top to bottom. And whether it’s a death at the facility, a class action lawsuit, or an environmental citation for mixing chemicals in dump bins, it will one day be shuttered, for the good of the community, and for the good of any other organization that needs to know how not to be run.

If CEO Todd Vasos isn't willing to work alone in a high crime store, don't ask any of your key carriers to do it for you.
