 reason I could ever recommend Kroger.
","- The Union (everything has ups and downs)
- One of which is the pay, especially if your state 
 has a low minimum wage, because that's where 
 everyone starts, usually only a few cents higher 
 than that, even for full time. And thanks to the 
 union pay scale, everyone makes the same, but 
 it'll take you 10-20 years to cap out your wage, 
 and you'll be lucky to make $15/hour by then. 
 (This is one reason why there is no future there 
 or in the grocery business in general, it's just not 
 what it used to be).
- The store management (at least in the store & 
 division I worked in). It's horribly disorganized, 
 and half of the managers I knew couldn't tell you which 
 end of a screwdriver to use. Pitiful. Really. Just pitiful.
- The list goes on, more bad than good, we had a running 
 joke that if you died, woke up and saw a building 
 with ""Kroger"" on it, you knew where you ended 
 up.

Tue Jan 12 2021, Grocery Clerk,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Average Retail Job,0,"- Schedule was consistent for overnight shifts.
","- Store management was inconsistent with disciplinary measures, allowing union to protect lackluster employees at the expense of others. 

- Stockers and those in other positions will often work full-time hours for months/years, without full-time status or benefits, as it must be applied for with the union. Approval is generally approved based on seniority in the union; it was explained that each store is only allotted a certain number of, despite excessive store need/workloads.

- HR inconsistently followed company policy.

","Low pay for the work load they expect. Always understaffed, and this is the hours given to them by the corporate office, so it's intentional. ELMS (Electronic Labor Management) dictates how long a certain job should take, so you're literally timed. Further, if your pulled up front (they're understaffed also, so it's on a regular basis), or help a customer, or a thousand other things, this isn't included on within ELMS. So there is a solid chance you won't finish your assigned job, though you will get the blame.
Further, with the Union and Corporate in a major power struggle, mostly dealing with the insurance. It was once fairly easy to get the insurance, it was based on hours average per month. Now it's done per week, and it's a 30+ hours range. They've seen a lot of employees get dropped. And remember, these are employees who struggle with there bills, and are likely on welfare. 
Hazard pay due to covid, last to give it, first to take it away.
Corporate complains the lack of friendliness, and how it needs to be improved. I've shopped at many other retail chains, with one particular that consistanly crushes Kroger, and has taken the lead with over satisfation along with customer count. Employees are employees, same with teenagers, the largest difference is manpower. When you have the various departments well stocked, twice to triple the manpower, customers are going to be far happier, especially when it comes time to check out, and instead of having two lanes at noon, there are at least 6 lanes open, which means no waiting.
Advice to Management
Management is hit and miss, just like at all jobs. It's the corporate office who need to listen to both the employees and customers, and realize they will continue to lose customers and market share unless they get the manpower within the stores. Likely it'll never get done, since they would have to overhaul there entire supply chain

-Managers are nothing more than company drones, who repeat policy whenever questioned.

Those are just a hint of whats in store if you apply here. Krogers desperatly wants to be like Walmart but at other times seems so at war within itself it seemes like the store wants to destroy itself. Anytime we took the company survey, it seemed obvious that the only destination the said complaints were going to were the paper shredder in corperate. There is a severe lack of communication between corperate and retail, not to mention that the Union is filled with pro company scabs and some of the stewards will barely take your side if anything. Avoid this place and go somewhere else, better to grab your lawn chair and watch this company go down in flames then be apart of the inferno yourself.

Fri Jan 08 2021, Bakers Employee,"Omaha, NE",Current Employee ,Would not recommend working here,0,"If you don’t want to work this job is perfect for you. There are no expectations for co-workers who do not do their jobs. Management has no issue putting the work load on someone who does their job.
","Regardless of how hard you work, there will be zero room for advancement. Kroger claims to have competitive pay but you will start at $9-10 an hour. If you are wanting a full time position I would suggest to look else where. Co-workers slack off and will leave you to do to a majority of the work. Management will also pull any of your co-workers to other departments like clicklist. You hard work does go unnoticed and will become an exception without gain. For example a co-worker who slacks off and stands around will get a full 40 hours a week but the other worker who works hard and maintains a level of satisfaction for the management and customers will struggle to get 30 hours a week if lucky. If a co-worker threatens you don’t worry because they will keep their job. If a manager is overly punishing you like cutting your hours for not covering a shift to where you do not have days off, management will do nothing and allow it to continue. Also be prepared to be scheduled where ever managers decide you will work despite what you were hired for. I would not recommend working here.
Advice to Management
Take notice to how hard certain employees work instead of outsourcing for open positions and hiring people for position leads that are not trained for the position. Quit cutting hours and hiring more people who do not work. It is work overload for those who have a good work ethic.

Listen to your employees that are on the floor. So many changes are made with little consideration on how employees are affected. Communication is key but lacking btwn management and employees.

","Seniority of long term union members screw over people with less experience and members that out perform them if they have less years. This includes hours cut to give the one with more seniority more hours. Establish shifts you earned taken away forcing to change your schedule if your not open availability. 

They do not pay hazard pay to employees while Covid 19 is still a threat.

Stores are not strict on people who refuse to where a mask they allow customers walk around with a mask off and let said customer expose themselves to we the employees since Covid 19 started.

They don't give employees time to clean the registers for health reasons for the employees and customers to prevent possible Covid 19 contamination. 

I wash my hands often because I have to take something for my mental health which forces me to go to the bathroom a lot they don't punish me for it.

However every other Cashiers and Courtesy Clerks who are exposed to everything the customers touch are not given time to wash their hands often during this Covid 19 epidemic.

They overwork every employee giving no raise to them for employees that want to work managers included. But give raises and promotions to those who are lazy and sit around and do nothing or text on their phones all day for non managers. And promote managers that let store problems rise to chaos level leaving the new manager to come in with chaos that the recently promoted left behind manager this happened twice at the store I work at.

Sun Jan 17 2021, E,"Benton, AR",Former Employee ,"Great job, horrible everything else",0,"Pretty straight forward work. Basically get paid to work out. Some customers actually show their appreciation to you for shopping for them in the past. It's nice knowing you're actually helping people. Sometimes you get tips from pick up orders.
","Where do I start? 
- There are managers/leads that will openly show that they don't like you and if they're having a bad day, you will know it.
- Clicklist manager didn't know how to schedule people. It wasn't just with me, multiple employees complained every week.
- After my first month, the clicklist manager threatened to fire me and told me that they also wanted to ""get rid of other older employees that are harder to get rid of"". This was our very first conversation and they started it with ""My managers chewed me out, so I'm going to chew out my employees"".
- It was very obvious that many employees were very depressed or stressed out working here.
- Clicklist is basically set up to make the employees fail: 
1. Sections were either mislabeled or not labeled at all. This is very important, because this information is how you find certain items and you're also timed.
2. The real timer isn't so bad and it's fairly accurate. There's an estimated time displayed on the scanner device that tells you how long each order should take to be prepared... The problem is that someone had the grand idea to say that the computer is wrong and that employees should complete the orders in half the time showed. So if your scanner says it should take you 1hr to complete the order, that number is accurate, but the company wants you done in 30mins. 
3. This means less quality and quantity for the order. It doesn't help that shelves aren't always stocked, plus helping customers, trying not to run them over, and locating items that have been moved to other display locations. 
- The work is easy to understand, but it is physically and emotionally demanding. Despite this, you don't get paid nearly as much as you deserve. There are less demanding positions and jobs that pay more. It's basically just minimum wage for this position.
- Last thing I feel like addressing is the fact that the Union has it out for Clicklist and for good reason. The Union is constantly trying to fix the problems with this department, but for some reason Kroger doesn't want to listen.
Advice to Management
Some of the managers here are amazing, extremely helpful, and professional; while others act like they are straight out of high school or had no management training ever. Please learn that your company could be 100x better if you treated your employees better. A healthy, pleasant, and sustainable work environment = happier and healthier employees = better production. Remember that you are nothing without your employees.

","Very little Covid protection measures, mask mandate is not enforced. 
No Hazard pay for working during Covid. 

I've worked for this company for 7 years and I barley make above minimum wage (Any of Kroger's competitors pay more for starting positions than what you get here in 7 years)

My department has no first aid kit going on 1 year despite brining it up to management several times. 

Upper management removed a key position related to my department making it hard to know what product is coming in and how much, and hard to correct mistakes in orders. 

Coworkers who make blatantly racist/homophobic comments are not punished, I overhear comments like this almost everyday I come in. Bullying at work is also not taken seriously. As a white person myself I have not personally experienced bullying or racist comments but I hear enough to know management is doing very little if anything to put a stop to it.
Advice to Management
Lower/store management is generally fine but lacks a backbone and are so nonconfrontational that employees get away with bullying and racist behavior with little to no punishment. Upper management lacks a fundamental understanding of the day to day job of its lower level employees, causing them to implement plans that are inefficient or literally impossible.

","The Kroger that I worked at in WV paid $8.75/hr. That is not a living wage in 2020. Despite the state's minimum wage, most businesses in the area are paying $10+. Kroger was always short-staffed. As a part-time employee, I was working almost 40 hours a week covering for their lack of scheduling. It was consuming my life for a weekly $200 paycheck. When I quit, the managers told me that they understood. Corporate will not allow them to raise the minimum starting wage. I was also supposed to have a higher starting wage for having 3 years previous experience in food service, but they did not give it to me. Another coworker had less than a year of experience being a soccer coach and was paid more than I was. The customers were also very rude, which is just a general con of customer service. $200/week is just not enough to deal with mean customers during a pandemic, especially because I wasn't even earning enough to cover my rent.

2. No, I won't knowingly expose customers to food with bugs in it/food that has gone bad. I do not care if that gets your bonus revoked.

The actual reason is that they have low pay, lower moral, and word gets around in the community that this business is poorly managed. The company as well as management talk the talk of corporate ideals, but their actions are quite the opposite. If you love being yelled at, working 12 hour days 7 days a week without meals or breaks this job is for you.

","Work life balance is a joke. You sign a contract that says 9 hour days and in 2018 you're told that it's mandatory to work 10. No contact or compensation changes. Wage increases are given on curve like a college course. Most receive a 1% raise. Everyone is on edge thinking they are about to lose their job. Departments on average lose about 20 hours of labor each year despite unit and sales increasing. If you like unrealistic expectations and a culture of doing more with less then sign your life away.

","Management doesn't care about you. Front end managers will ask you to do other jobs like checker but you still get paid the same low wage as customer service. HR said I'd be working part time, which is what I wanted because so was in school, but over the next few weeks I was working full time. They'd schedule me to close at 10 pm and have me come in to open at 6 am the next morning which you're not allowed to do, you're supposed to have 8 hours between shifts at least. They eouldnt fuve me time to even eat lunch or drive to work after my classes. They would literally schedule me the minute my class finished as if I can just transport to work and like I dont need to eat. I never called in or missed a day, but one day after working there for many months, I was extremely sick and called in, their response was that if I decide not to come in, they'd write me up and it would go on my record and that would be my decision. So I go in anyway, barely even able to stand or work, and I dont even get a comment or ""thank you for your effort"" or anything! Customer service entails a bunch of jobs and the pay is terrible for the amount of work you have. Also, if a customer is upset about anything, you are the face that they think is at fault and this job was emotionally and mentally destructive. I went home barely holding it together. Most people they hired in the time I was there quit after less than a year, Including myself.

Grabbing those crates when they’re stacked high up and you’re a short person causes so much strain on your neck and back, I just left. I will be back the next day because I recorded video evidence of me expressing my concerns that I didn’t feel safe back there, that I hurt myself today, and I would like to be moved up front.

-Management/higher ups get mad about calling off even when for an unavoidable, legitimate reason & all protocols are followed

Leadership can be hit or miss, since a great deal of them have never worked anywhere but Kroger. The company is going through a period of trying to figure out how to be a modern organization, from an operational standpoint (thanks to a kick in the nether regions by Amazon) . Currently, the entire organization is run off of MS Excel. So if you've worked in an industry such as medical, CPG, etc. and come to work for Kroger, it will be like stepping back into the 1990s. I hope that this won't be the case in a couple of years, if the modernization efforts take hold.
","Kroger is very siloed (division to division). There are several functions that perform the same scope of work, however, don't talk to each other. Thus lose out on potential gains that could be realized by leveraging the scale of the organization and commonality in disciplines.
Advice to Management
Loose all the various banners. Be one ""Kroger"". This will help to eliminate the silo culture that is so pervasive and limiting there. All your major competitors are single-branded. Take the hint, step into the present. You won't loose customers.
