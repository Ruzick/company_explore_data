Mon Feb 01 2021, Direct Sales Representative,"College Point, NY",Former Employee ,"Great Starter Sales Job, Not Much Beyond That",0,"If this is your first sales job and you are enthusiastic about working, you can't ask for much more than what's given. The base pay is good, the commission is uncapped and fairly decent, there's a 401k matching program, and you're given a very generous amount of PTO on day one. There is comprehensive training (all paid) and while there are some bumps at the beginning, management will do everything in your power to prepare you for heading into the field. If you have the right supervisor, you are given an extremely generous amount of assistance and proper encouragement.

If you last at this job for at least a year and have produced a lot, it is extremely likely you will be hired if you apply to a B2B role or possibly even Supervisor, depending on how well your name is known around the office. 

Even if neither of these end up happening, you have extremely effective resume material that will undoubtedly get you hired elsewhere. Direct Sales has extremely high turnover, and those that last more than a few months and produce are extremely qualified for other sales job.

Ultimately, if you are a genuinely consistent superstar in selling the product, you will not have problems. Management will give you plenty of freedom and you will have plenty of money heading your way.
","Unfortunately, as the months pass, the cracks usually begin to show for most that work here. The top reps in the office ALWAYS partake in some form of fraud, and while the blatant cheaters do get fired quickly, you will be left cleaning up their mess if you are assigned their turf. 

Management says it will not assign turf unless it has been 3 months since the last rep was there, but this is a blatant lie. I have been assigned turf a week after the last rep left, and even if you are a phenomenal rep, there is little you can do to salvage the entire month. 

It is extremely draining to be working here during slow months. The lack of sales is one thing, but management will hold daily accountability calls where they guilt trip you for not having sold, not having sold more, and not having sold more service units per sale. I understand it is their job to encourage, but the method by which they go about it is extremely misguided. Something similar happens in regards to taking PTO, where your supervisor will always grill you and make you feel guilty for doing so. Very unprofessional.

I mentioned having a very supportive supervisor but from what I gather through the grapevine this is actually the exception and not the norm. Most supervisors in the office do little more than head out into the field to shadow you and remind you to follow up with customers. Mine took most of what wasn't selling out of my hands and into his, but when you do not have this privilege, it is a tough game of micromanagement.

Since you're working from 1:00PM-9:00PM as well as on weekends the work-life balance is just not there.
Advice to Management
Shift toward a culture of positive reinforcement and back away from always focusing on the negatives. Your employees are talented and will perform better if they feel their management is confident in their abilities. Stop babying the entire office if we aren't having a stellar month.

They revisit these leads every three months, so you may end up liking the same house multiple times in a year. In many cases The leads already know what you’re doing. This isn’t a bad thing or you can just get a repetitive. Because they are visited so often, it can be hard to make sells some months.They offer sales incentives almost every week and the incentives are good for people at any skill level to achieve. They are working on making the leads even better though which is nice! Like most door-to-door sales jobs, the best hours to work are when people are home. This means do you want to make sure you are working between five and 8 to 830. During the summer it’s not too bad, but during the winter it gets dark around 5 o’clock and it can be a little sketchy knocking on someone’s door in the middle of the country at 8o’clock at night. I had a gun drawn on me a few times, luckily people here in North Carolina our just worried about safety so they never shoot. I really like my family time, and so I miss being home in the early evening And I feel like I miss out on events because of this, but I do get to stay at home for the morning time.

There's no advice to give. all the managers get orders from above that are directly tied to investors making maximum profit; nothing will ever change. The system is working perfectly by design.
The company went bankrupt from bad business practices in the late 2000's. When they came back the transitioned into changing their name over to spectrum. They came back strong with all their focus on getting the trust of their old and new customers back by focusing on quality assurance and customer satisfaction. I joined the team right before the transition from quality to quantity and I think that's where I ultimately didn't fit in anymore; when they stopped caring for the customer and their workers and cared more about new accounts and maximized profits.

","Low salaries and benefits makes it difficult to retain talent and company is left with lots of incompetent people. Lots of bureaucratic deadweight. No bonus incentive for entry level employees. Heavy dependence on consulting companies and contractors means that there's an even worse rate of turnover that's already being influenced by their inability to retain talent and that leaves behind business intelligence vacuum. Conservative and old school work environment that can sometimes not be very friendly for people that don't fit the mold.

AT&T has crappy service! But you will hear ALL DAY LONG, how happy their customers are and how they are treated (Great customer experience). It's becoming very difficult staying at Spectrum hearing from people all day long about how terrible the company treats their customers or how inconsistent the network is (facts. My internet is intermittent all the time, and I work for them). You will hear AT&T customers all day tell you how they pay as much as DOUBLE the price and are happy with AT&T and in many cases, even have half the internet speed.

Tue Jan 19 2021, Internet and Phone Repair Representative,"Columbus, OH",Former Employee ,This was the worst customer service job I had ever had,1,"The pay was somewhat decent
","The expectations were outrageous. Customers that typically call in were usually elderly or people who in general were technology illiterate. Because of this customers would get outrageously angered at the person on the other end of the line, which is usually pretty typical for call center jobs. The problem was you had no time to breathe between phone calls. Calls were always in queue and you were expected to take calls back to back. You were also expected to have a call time that was under 11 minutes while also performing a required intro and outro. I think the last thing that made this one of the worst jobs I had ever had was I wasn't even allowed to go to the bathroom when needed. I worked 4 10 hr shifts a week and during those shifts if I would use more than 5 minutes of personal time a week, which is the aux you needed to be in to go to the bathroom, I would be written up.

To that end, we recently made a number of changes to our operations that will help our employees better manage through this challenging time. These include an additional 15 days of paid time off to be used for any COVID-19 related personal need, increased social distancing plans in all of our call centers and operations facilities, and the option for remote work for employees whose jobs allow them to work outside the office without endangering our obligation to provide critical services.

Tue Dec 01 2020, Field Technician,"Morrisville, NC",Former Employee ,Overall a decent company,1,"The company has good training, most of the employees and leadership are great. Clear pay progression, annual raises, employee service perks, and many other benefits. Overall it's a great company that has a few kinks that should be expected with such a large company.
","MICRO MANAGING 
The higher up you get the more corporate interference you deal with. Managers do well at trying to mitigate the chaos but logistics to the application is a nightmare. Quality is sacrificed for speed and the company has cut a lot of incentives to stay with the company. Many higher-end employees have switched careers or have taken demotions to get back into the field and away from management. Some very ignorant policies like not working on tech classes well working even if you have no jobs or are on light duty. By policy they rather you sit and listen to customer care. Progression raises we cut.
Advice to Management
Again overall the company is great. My advice would be to let your managers manage their teams. You cant expect fish to climb trees. Some of the best techs I worked with were very thurrell, precise, and professional but a bit slower because they didn't rush their metrics and that penalized them. Again let your management manage, the environment and relationship in the teams were honestly impressive but I get why so many managers wanted to step down, and why many people leave. Although there's a lot of freedom in the company it feels like there are very little confidence and trust in the people hired as managers so they ride their teams to push metrics which degrades the quality of service. I 100% love the family environment and completely agree with the competitive atmosphere. An incentive could even be added to the best teams to encourage consistent quality work. Again the largest flaw I see with spectrum is the micromanaging and unrealistic standards that hold repercussions for their team leads.

","Work expectations are out of line, expected to work 8 hour day, followed by doing nighttime code deployments, and then expected to work another full 8 hour day following deployment. On some occasions expected to support outages through primetime which leads to working 24+ hours straight. 

Almost impossible to promote internally, one of my former collogues quit the company for two weeks to negotiate a position on another team in order to get promoted. They have since done that again. That should not be necessary for promotion.

I worked at Spectrum full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Free tv and internet, decent benefits
Cons
Horrible management, high pressure sales environment, constantly under threat of being fired if you don't make ridiculously high sales goals, commission structured so that the most you can make is $12k per year but it is nearly impossible to hit that because they are constantly raising the bar of what you need to sell to get there. Moving up is all who you know and who likes you, not truly performance based. The stress of the environment makes for very poor work/life balance because you always take home the worry of not making goals and not getting commission and maybe losing your job. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

How can anyone be efficient being over 9-10!stores, 70 employees, and 8 lower management reports and be on back to back calls every day?? In addition to calls there was far too many responsibilities and unrealistic expectations left on an Area Manager. There were new stores opening every month and all of the setting up and hiring was left on the Area Manager and Lower leadership. 

When Mobile was launched a ton of extra duties were added with overall less pay due to negative commission changes. Mobile was launched prematurely with half way planning and systems. Retail can’t transfer calls or hang up like other departments do, they have to solve the issue as they are with the customer. But imagine not having an answer at all or a resolution due to lack of structure with a company. So we were up against constant battles and challenges with every department interaction. It was never one team one dream with the company. With every kind employee was 10 jerk ones that treated us poorly. 

There was also a huge lack of sensitivity around covid in retail and a continued focus on goals goals goals. This was also the case prior to covid and during big initiatives like all digital changes for the company requiring cable boxes ok every tv. That was horrible and done in NY during the winter! Imagine working out of tents in winter weather and having to serve thousands of irate customers. Who thought that one up? Again this was left on local leadership to set up tent vendors and hotels etc to hold the influx of customers in our make shift pop up stores. 

Upper management admitted to reviewing store surveillance to spy on staff to ensure proper distancing etc. It is extremely hard to distance while reps are setting up cell phones and interacting with 40+ customers a day. Lack of empathy and appreciation from both HR and upper management. Very large work load and no work life balance at all. On top of all that, customers treat employees like garbage and hate Spectrum. Lastly all other departments that the retail team had to rely on were rude and difficult to work with.

To that end, we recently made a number of changes to our operations that will help our employees better manage through this challenging time. These include an additional 15 days of paid time off to be used for any COVID-19 related personal need, increased social distancing plans in all of our call centers and operations facilities, and the option for remote work for employees whose jobs allow them to work outside the office without endangering our obligation to provide critical services.

","Develop a toxic relationship with communiation as you will get constant pressure and negative feedback from leadership. Company is structured like a pyramid scheme, the only difference is that you actually get paid, but it's onlt the bottom rung employees that generate revenue for the rest of the company. So they drive you hard and then fire you on a whim, We were instructed to mask the selling of home phone with internet sales. Then When spectrum fears an audit from the FCC they terminate the people doing what they were instructed to do. Some good managers/sups but they can only be kind to you to an extent, they have a job to do too. This is a toxic work environment. I went off of coffee working here because this job caused me so much anxiety, coffee would just push me over the edge. Go here to make money while you look for something else. You will start out working nights so you can do interviews at other companies the mornings.

","Extremely high turnover role, most reps last 8 months or less. Not really an IT sales job more of a telephone sales job, good for entry level telephone sales reps with no IT sales experience. Advertised as an IT sales job but it isn't. 1 time sale, and you have to make about 60 calls a day and send out about 120 emails a day and even then a very, very low % of reps make it to 60% of a quota in a month, managers constantly recruiting. Just look how often the job is posted and how many jobs are posted across the country for this role. It is a very high high turnover job but if you need a job for 6 months take it but it is rough, base salaries are a joke. If you last a year, which is rare, it is about a 75k a year job +/- but very toxic place to work. No reason to get to know your teammates names, they are gonna be gone in a month.

Plenty of overtime.

PTO (!!!)
","Much of the overtime hours never make it onto the hours listed or paid. Supervisors get worried about their ""quota,"" and if someone's extra hours reduced their ""productivity"" then they change your hours worked or make you clock off while on the job.
Every job a tech does is supposed to be done in about 90 minutes. It's not possible to set a time frame for unknown factors. You don't know the job until you get there. Ok, the customer is having internet issues, but what fires that entail? Am I swapping out a router and then go? Or am I replacing the line at the utility pole, then running it underground through a 300 ft conduit, then pulling it under the structure in a 1.5 ft crawlspace, drilling through the floor to get the line in doors and then installing new eqipment? Then I have to wait for another department to complete the coding so that the equipment will receive signal...
You see what I'm saying? Quota is for factory workers who attach part A to part B every day. It's not for a series of unknown factors in a technical job.
Veterans run the show. If you aren't an adherent of government worship then you cant join their clique (but do you really want to?).
Lastly, work dominates life.
The corporate and HR are completely disconnected from reality.

Sat Nov 07 2020, Master Control Operator,"Albany, NY",Current Employee ,Gained a Lot of Skills to Move ahead,0,"Learned to work with Routers, Switchers, Dalet Automation, Manage Commercials and much more. Eventually found myself in related fields such as livestreaming and learning to how to build broadcast servers on my own during pandemic. Learned to work as part of a team and understanding all levels of the team. Eventually decided to go back for masters degree so I can learn more about streaming and broadcast management. Supervisors are nice, got along with MCO supervisor well and always made sure the team was happy. This was my second gig at Charter also being an intern at spectrum news ny1 I decided to go upstate to learn new skills.
","Not a 9-5 job. Shifts will be assigned to anything in a 24/7 cycle. Things will change. Rotating shift schedule should be an option for some. Dealing with some personalities is always tricky anywhere but everyone seems to be cool. met some people from Nyc area as well. Made some key contacts at both Albany and NYC and have professional contacts for future jobs. The best thing to have if you work overnight is to have friends on the other side of the world, so at least you can talk to people on your midnight break. Also, technology always changes so the knowledge that I learned here would change in 10 Years.

Spectrum services aren’t unique or competitively price in anyway. Fiber internet companies are a dime a dozen.

Advice to Management
Allow your front line tech support more access to basic functions with out needing to reach out to a lead or another department. This will reduce overall call time for the customer creating a better experience and empower front line creating a better employee experience.

Consider who you promote and how quickly. Seeing employees get promoted from within is great, but not when it compromises quality by promoting someone multiple times rapidly.

","Management isn't the best. They want your opinion but at the same time they don't even listen to it after said and done. The trainings are almost never on what you actually do because they have several different teams there and you could be in a training for something totally different then what you will be doing. If you want better hours than what you are given.... forget about it i had to go a medical route due to my condition and that was even hard to do. Hr is honestly the worst they are supposed to help you but just give you sarcastic answers when asked or dont even answer your questions. To top of the schedule part of this you can get a shift from 2-11pm and be asking for a earlier schedule since itd be better for you and your family or etc as well have a pretty good and decent time into the company for example i was there for 3 years and they fought it but when new hires would hit the floor they would give them shifts like 8-5 or 9-6 and would still tell you they dont have the space for you to move to a earlier shift. As well dont try to argue that becuase they will hear you out but they dont really care and wont do anything to help you out anyways. The company is honestly a joke when it comes to management. Please look at a diffrent job if you want something where they will treat you better, If you want free services but like coming home being stressed out and wanting to just be a blob this is your place theres nothing truely here that is good in the long run. Last thing if you are a good worker, don't even think about getting a promotion. They will hold you in your position so they can use you like a work horse, but on the side they will go ahead and promote people who have absolutely no idea what they are doing while you are working your butt off trying to do better and help as much. they say they have career advancement opportunities but yet do stuff like that.

Leadership needs to take their job more seriously and help with the work load for reps.

Advice to Management
Give the representatives the ability to hang up or transfer livid customers. If not to everybody, at least let people with anxiety or PTSD do that. Also, if your representative has a rough day and accidentally cussed when their on hold and the customer can’t hear them give them grace just tell them not to do it again. Don’t just fire them and if it’s a repeated Occitan day then you should fire them. It’s not fair if I good employee has a bit of a rough day and cusses once and gets fired with no further consideration.

People in various departments had/have COVID and still made employees come in. PPE took forever to be given out. Job is boring and routine, they will dress it to be something way different than what you will actually do.

To that end, we recently made a number of changes to our operations that will help our employees better manage through this challenging time. These include an additional 15 days of paid time off to be used for any COVID-19 related personal need, increased social distancing plans in all of our call centers and operations facilities, and the option for remote work for employees whose jobs allow them to work outside the office without endangering our obligation to provide critical services.

I worked at Spectrum part-time for less than a year
Pros
There were not any pros at this job.
Cons
The pay was not nearly enough for what all they requested the employees to do. You are left to deal with irate customers, even on your first day, training on the floor. They dont allow you the proper amount of training time. Everytime, aside from TWICE, while training, they made me stop training to help customers, instead of learning what I had needed to be successful within the store. While out sick with COVID, the harassed me every.single.day starting at 6am via text and phone, asking me the same thing wr had discussed the day before. I had gotten in trouble when i had came back to work for not answering all their calls, which is ridiculous. They couldn't care less if you have Doctors notes. I was told it doesn't excuse absences(even if whatever happemed was so severe it left you in the hospital), it only gives an idea of when you will be back. Sales reps TAKE your sales and will mask it by stating they're helping you. When the protests went on in the next city over, the racism of some of the reps jumped out. I was told by another rep that we(African Americans) need to get over racism and that the confederate flag isnt offensive because it was the past. I over heard this same individual making jokes about police brutality, he was Jewish, which is crazy to me. I ultimately ended up quitting, the money and lack of hours just wasnt worth dealing with any of this, when i can work with a company that pays more, gives more hours, and respects me as a human being. As well as respects me enough not to harass me daily while battling a serious illness.

The teams we work in are really supportive and helpful and they generally have a positive attitude and are great coworkers.
","Micromanaged to the core. It use to be a very free dept where they trusted you to get your work done and make money. However after new leadership came in we began to be micromanaged more and more every month.

Yes we are telesales and I understand we have metrics we must abide by, however with them consistently raising the metric goals and lowering our opportunities to sell with policies that get made up week after week, it gets stressful. We have to do a lot of off the phone work and business owners and decision makers do not always have the time to speak on the phone, most like to email correspond. However, they still expect high dials and high sales with high talk time by just burning through the dialer leads.

","Spectrum sets unrealistic expectations for all employees. They do not have any support for their leadership. Upper management does not know how to do any operational tasks and bounce you around from person to person to find help. Training was not good. When asked why you are not completing a task correctly and say its because you were never trained, the answer is always ""me either"". Store leadership is overloaded with responsibilities with no guidance or support. All systems are so outdated and redundant. Different stores are given different equipment to assist with customer traffic and help overall numbers but ALL stores are held to the same standards. Upper leadership holds discipline over your head and uses corrective actions as a scare tactic. Human resources is never able to answer direct questions. Regional managers tell employees they are able to do something that is clearly outlined as a violation of company policy. Job descriptions are very unclear. During the interview, employees are promised money that has been taken away during the COVID pandemic. Spectrum did not care about any of their front line employees during the pandemic.

Wed Sep 09 2020, Field Operations Manager,"Middletown, NY",Current Employee ,Not what is used to be,1,"As a company, they offer great employee benefits. Insurance, Highly discounted (ALMOST) Free Cable, phone, and internet services. An excellent retirement accumulation plan, plus a 401k and 100% match up to 6% of income.
","The company has or at least my regional leadership team has lost its focus on its employees. There is ZERO concept of work life balance and in my role there is no such thing as time away. Sure you get vacation, but why use it, you will work anyway. Preferred communication is harshly worded emails and motivation via intimidation - and that just was senior leadership says to your face.
Advice to Management
Your supervisor, manager, and directors are not slaves. Work life balance is important. Also - Keep your AVP's and RVP's in check, you are losing excellent talent, not because people dislike the company, but because they cannot stand being micromanaged by former Cablevision failures. When you focus solely on metrics and not people moral goes away because people become just an expendable expense. When you focus on people, moral improves the metrics.

Wed Sep 30 2020,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Good Luck avoiding COVID-19,3,"- There will always be work available (if you're willing to sacrifice yourself and that of your loved ones).
- The company provided a 120 hour flex time to be used for when you eventually catch COVID-19
","- Doesn't care about your health and safety.
- Doesn't care about preventing the spread of COVID-19
- They will do anything that can save the company some money, even if it means the health of it's employees.

- The company provided a 120 hour flex time to be used for when you eventually catch COVID-19. However, people who are smart enough to want to prevent catching it and spreading it attempted to work from home, but the CEO believes that there is no such thing as working from home so that wasn't allowed. At first the leadership allowed people who didn't feel safe in the office environment to work from home. The issues began to arise when they would request employees full access of their medical records so they can see IF you would fall within the CDC guidelines of an at-risk person. If they couldn't corroborate this, you could either report back to the office or indicate you live with someone that may be at-risk. If you do live with someone that could be at-risk, then they would also have to get a doctor to certify why that person is at-risk. Never mind the invasion of privacy to attempt to stay safe during a pandemic, but it's hard to feel safe in an office environment that week after week reports more and more positive COVID-19 Cases. 

If you're asking yourself WHY would a company would make an employee have to jump through so many hoops to avoid catching and spreading deadly virus, it's simple, they don't care. They do care however that if you do not use the awarded Flex Time, they would have to pay out a rough amount of $240 million at the end of the year. In efforts to save money, they force you to either quit, or use that PTO/Flex time to avoid going to the office, when all if not 99% of the office work has been done at home for over 6 months.

","Spectrum cannot get out of it's own way. The back office processes and procedures make the job unnecessarily stressful. This part of job is why you make so much money.

Fix your back office systems. You need an operations management team in every major market to ensure this.

Sun Sep 20 2020, Video Support,,Former Employee ,They don't care about you.,0,"Co-workers can be nice. They will bribe you to be at work with snacks and popcorn. Charter reward points can be nice. They have insurance, not the best, but it's there. SOME management is great. Set schedule.
","I don't even know where to start. Don't ever miss work, EVER. They bribe you to stay at work by sending emails to everyone about ""prize winners"" for not missing work during the month, yes during covid as well. 
Speaking of COVID-19 I could go into a lot of detail, but here's the main points: Unless you are considered high-risk and have documentation from a doctor from THIS YEAR you will be working in the call center & sharing desks (no assigned desks just find a seat and sit), masks are not required, if you fill out the information they have you fill out before coming to your shift & per that app you cannot go in you still get penalized for missing work. IT'S A GLOBAL PANDEMIC PEOPLE. Lighten up. 
Management will constantly tell you how you can do better & not give any positive feedback, even if you are a top performer. If you do miss work your manager will text you begging you to come in - yes, still during covid. They constantly compare you to other locations when those locations aren't following the same scripts/protocols/dealing with the same customer base . 
Video support & retention in the same building - yet treated unequally. Retention is royalty to them. 
Don't you dare take your lunch late because you're stuck on a call, that's an infraction.
They will not work with your schedule if you need to change it for any reasons unless you qualify for a new schedule and hope there is one that matches with what you need. Otherwise they'll provide one for 30 days. woo ,yeah that doesn't help. 
Customers are jerks but what is worse is that every other department gets to lie to this customers to get them in the door and video support has to be the one to clean up the mess and be the bad guy. If you do something wrong in video support, you're immediately spoken to about it & watched like a hawk. I'm guessing that same thing doesn't happen in other departments because it'll be MONTHS of the same thing happening.
If you request a day off, you may not get it approved, even if you're not trying to take sick/vacation time. I requested to take a day off for surgery and got denied and when I spoke with HR they said ""Well, you shouldn't have scheduled the surgery without seeing if you could get the day off first""... Really?

I worked at Spectrum full-time for less than a year
Pros
They offer great benefits and the team I worked with was awesome.
Cons
The job structure is not set up for you to succeed. I was in a ""sales"" position, but all I did was listen to customer complaints and have people cuss at me all day and throw a fit about their equipment. The store is set up like a DMV where people sign in and you call them up one by one as you're stuck at your podium all day. The customer nor the employees get to have a chair to sit in but they wanted us to take our time with our customers and try to sell them everything but most of the customers are very elderly and can't stand for a long time.

Wed Aug 26 2020, Store Specialist,"Florence, KY",Current Employee ,More Clerking than Selling,0,"- Pay and rewards aren't too bad, goals are pretty attainable.
- Not as high pressured as other mobile stores.
","- If you go in expecting it to be a full on sales job, you have another thing coming. You'll probably spend the majority of time returning and issuing equipment, as well as dealing with angry customers wanting to complain about their bill.
- If you come from a mobile selling background, the system for selling phones isn't the most intuitive. It's a slow process to sell a phone but the worst part is you can get an error message at the very end of the sale, telling you the order cannot be completed in the store, no other reason is given for why the sale has failed. New ID capture systems have been put in, presumably to solve this problem with added fraud protection, however this system is broken and almost never scans an ID correctly first time of asking.
-A poor manager can really ruin the experience. The company is hellbent on beating other mobile providers, and is trying to make it a mobile store, despite it still being an Cable and Internet provider first and full-most. My store got a new manager in at the turn of the year and his mobile background has been an hindrance rather than a help. The clientele and environment isn't the same, Verizon it ain't. A total disregard of team morale, creating a toxic competitive atmosphere that has taken any sort of fun I had before in the job.
Advice to Management
If you want to become one the mobile big boys then make it easier in the system to sell mobile phones. As for the vast majority of customers we still get day in and day out, make it clearer to customers of their options for returning equipment, don't just have customer service tell them to come to the store when UPS is supposed to be our preferred option for return. Don't punish us for having us return equipment and count against us when you look at our unique transactions. As for loyal customers who had service for years before you took over the company that came before, give us more options for helping those out who have been customers for 20 years. Instead of just giving out the deals for new customers.

You have to be in the field from 2:30-8 but if you choose to work earlier or later its no penalty. They pay you your full commission after 8 sales which is not a hard target to hit. I've seen reps making $85 an hour but a more average rep would be making around $17-$20 an hour. You get two ""salary checks"" every month which are around $600. Then you get a $400 gas check once a month and commission once a month. You can easily make $4000 monthly here and it is NO PUNISHMENT for being a good salesperson. The education assistance is real and easy to apply for, PTO time is very generous. I love this job and I honestly don't ever want to leave. I'm hoping to get my business management degree and eventually becoming a manager.

Mon Sep 07 2020, Field Service Technician,"Columbus, OH",Current Employee ,Career Suicide,2,"Free internet, take home vehicle.
","This company is more concerned with micromanaging and how long you take on a job than they are with getting the job done right. You are constantly given jobs for the incorrect points when the company makes everything you do all about the points, so you are constantly having to explain wy your points are low when you do a job worth 30 points, for just 13 points. The company took away the dispatcher's ability to fix those points, thus leaving you to do the work even though you are not being pointed for it. Add in the fact that your bonus pay is based on these points, the company is literally ripping you off. You are expected to put your very life at risk and enter every single home, even if the fix for the job does not require it (with the pandemic, that is just outright dangerous and puts our lives at unnecessary risk, our very lives are being gambled with by this company) and when you bring up an issue with this to the company, you are told that maybe this job is not for you...imagine that, a 13 year vet of the business and I am told this job is not for me. This is not the fault of the supervisors, but the people at the top very of the company. Add on top of this, we no longer have specific areas, so our drive times have quadrupled which adds even more to our lack of points. We have been given more and more job duties on job but are not given more time to do them. We have one hour to complete a job, when the job may require several hours to correctly fix...add on top of this that when the job is not correctly fixed, we are hammered on for a customer calling back in. This company is vile toward its employees and I would never suggest anyone ever work for this company. There is so much more going on than this, but this should be enough to detour even the most eager of applicants. And no, I am not a disgruntled employee, in fact I put my very job at risk by writing this as the company literally monitors your online (private) activities even outside of the company. This is an authoritarian company and if you are thinking about applying for this company, do yourself and your sanity a favor...don't.

Tue Aug 11 2020, Chat Sales Agent,"West Columbia, SC",Former Employee ,Bait and Switch,4,"The benefits are really great
","They will hire you as a chat sales agent but you will actually be thrown on the phones as needed since they are so understaffed in the voice department. They are understaffed in chat too, but they don’t put voice agents on the chat to help. They would rather just turn off the chat function on the website and make all the chat agents take phone calls. 

You get no training on how to handle phone calls, but your managers will constantly be ridding you about your metrics not being good enough since you have different metrics to meet when you take phone calls. The on the job training just teaches you how to use all of the online applications and programs you need to do the job. It doesn’t actually teach you how to do the job. So your already at a disadvantage of not knowing how to do your job as a chat representative, and then you have to figure out how to take phone calls too.

We're definitely still required to come into the office without any other ""option"" besides quitting or being fired! If you're in the Charlotte area feel free to ride by our office on Arrowood Rd and you'll see the parking lot is full Mon-Fri. Every week they send us 2-3 emails that someone new has COVID in our office and they don't shut the office down to clean or sanitize. Don't apply for any position during the pandemic unless you like being treated like a number instead of a human being. Did I mention the hand sanitizer and wipes they gave us were recalled for poisoning people. For the people that have children who have to be home schooled... They don't care! We're expected to leave our kids home alone so they can teach themselves, while we have to unnecessarily come into the office and do a job that can be done from home. Don't you dare go to HR about it! They're liars too as you can tell by some of their responses to the reviews. No matter the issue they always make us feel like we're overreacting.

Thu Jul 30 2020, Retail Sales Associate,"Dallas, TX",Former Employee ,"Okay commission structure, awful management",1,"If you know how to sale it’s not hard to make money, especially on months when there’s incentives on top...but you can literally sell anywhere.
","First of all, store management knows next to nothing. They’re almost never there, when they are you’re better off just finding your answers through knowledge bases, and they hardly ever bother to come to the floor even when there’s an issue with a customer. Little to no control over employees which makes it extremely difficult for those who actually work. The lazies can literally get away with just being lazies which not only makes your day harder and seemingly longer but mentally exhausts you. And the best part about it is being told just to deal with it. 


Upper management cares about money more than anything. They push sales but give you a system that literally doesn’t work and instead of taking accountability they put the fault on the sales associates and management. (For example, we were told during a meeting that the system isn’t an issue because stores with higher store volumes are pushing numbers and hitting goals without problem...but the obvious issue is that the system goes down constantly, preventing associates from making sales, so when it does those customers leave without the services they came in for and they will either 1) leave and call customer service and place the order over the phone or at a later time over the phone and save gas 2) give you their number if they recognize you’re the one that sold them, and follow up with you to save your commission. It’s normally not the latter. So stores with lower volumes get hit really hard, when it goes down that might’ve been all the sales that came in for the day. Whereas higher volumes get sales back to back...if the system went down it wouldn’t matter because there’s still 15 people waiting in queue when it came back up.)

Also, since they’re so new in the game with mobile service they’re grossly ill prepared with the consequences that comes with that. And I mean that all around. You have to value your employees and your customers more than the money in your pocket. I’ve worked at cell stores and got robbed before (never at gun point) and they paid to have an officer in the store. You can literally get held hostage with the barrel of a gun on you and this company will do next to nothing. ESPECIALLY if your store isn’t hitting goals. 


Lastly I would say from my experience and where I was it is 100% a family club. Stores feel extremely cliquey, management has friends and family on their floors so they can literally sit on FaceTime and not take customers and get told absolutely nothing. And upper management will just make empty threats because they’re friends with management too. Seriously this job exhausts you mentally. There’s too many changes, no order, no structure, feels like working at the worst kind of startup...but at least in my experience startups care about your complaints and worker’s sanity.
Advice to Management
Just purge newer management and start all over with people actually qualified to lead without complaining about their workload. Also, I’ve never worked at a company that didn’t have a method of submitted anonymous evals which just shows inner retention means absolutely nothing in terms of importance.
