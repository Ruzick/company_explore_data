","Slowly dying and not looking to really make a stepwise change or diversify.
Some great people, but we kept a ton of bad apples.
The reorg was not well thought out in terms of how to execute
Too many consultants with a foothold without knowing our company. This lead to the adoption of a hybrid conglomerate of multiple operating models.
As an external hire who has spent a number of years here, I can say this place is as good as your manager and perhaps worse since the opportunities to switch roles seems to have dried up with the org changes.

Get the consultants out. Weed out the bad seeds. Diversify. Just because we are a mature company in a mature industry doesn't mean we have to accept a slow death.

","Like many corporations, Chevron is bending the knee to the ""Social Justice"" movement. This means that the workforce is being atomized and pitted against itself. Reference Chevron's press releases from earlier this year crowing about how personnel reductions at upper levels had disproportionately affected white men. This trend can be linked to some large investors very loudly proclaiming a focus on so-called ""ES&G"" metrics. This also brings about an irrational focus on ""going green"". Up until a year or so ago, I was proud to see Chevron was resisting the industry trend of mouthing the ""Carbon is bad"" mantra. This has flipped and quickly in the last year. Terrible for morale
Advice to Management
You will never appease socialists and communists whose major problem with Chevron is that they as ""stakeholders"" don't absolutely control it. All of the pressure on Critical Race Theory and carbon intensity is a means to an end. You will never be in a better position to fight it. Make the decision to fight for your company or lose it.

A fairly good work life balance, but constant downsizings have eroded some of this. The company has many employee networks to improve employee experience.
The company is trying to take care of the thousands of employees being laid off.
","I hate to say it, but avoid this company like the plague. I used to love working for Chevron, but now I’m just trying to hang on until retirement. Constant downsizing has destroyed the previous collaborative culture. It is now a dog eat dog company. Politics rule all decisions. Personnel decisions are based on favoritism and cliques. If you do not have a powerful sponsor, prepare for a lousy job or a target on your back for the next downsizing.

The focus is on cost cutting and improving the bottom line. This is a declining industry and management has not made any meaningful changes to embrace a lower-carbon future.

If you are in any service function your job will be automated or outsourced to Philippines or Argentina. If you are a petrotech, it’s still not too bad, but if you have a long career left, get out of O&G. Retrain yourself. We are coming through a massive downsizing and will probably have another in less than two years.
Advice to Management
Walk the talk. You preach accountability and We Lead behaviors, but have never held yourselves accountable for the bad decisions that got us into this mess. All the decision makers who oversaw MCP massive overruns that will continue to drag down our margins for years, remain in place. The rank and file are being shown the door by the thousands for your mistakes, yet you remain. If you really want to Transform to Win, you need to replace management with new blood, who actually embrace We Lead Behaviors and Growth Mindset.

Come up with a meaningful energy transition plan. Similar to your empty words around accountability, your language around transition, rings hollow. If you do not fully embrace a lower carbon strategy, you will destroy this company. This is where we Transform to Win, not meaningless words by the same leaders, but through changed behaviors and strategies.

Sat Sep 12 2020, Engineer,"Los Angeles, CA",Current Employee ,Definitely a good place to start a career...,1,"For a chemical or mechanical engineer, you'll get to fully use your education. Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training.

Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days.

There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.
","Weak opportunities for non-engineers. If you aren't an engineer, expect to spend your career mostly in the same place and at best climbing the ladder only one or two rungs.

Repeated relocations are expected for anyone who wants to climb the ladder. If you are married to someone gainfully employed outside Chevron or are otherwise not positioned to relocate every few years, you'll go nowhere in the long-run. The saying is: ""If you don't move, you don't matter"".

Once you reach mid-career, the opportunities become very limited. Training and development is not really intended to help you. If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions.

There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents.

Under CEO Mike Wirth, Chevron has gone all-in on ""woke"" politics, in an especially ham-fisted way. If you aren't inclined towards PC culture, you'll need to learn to fake it or at least stay very silent. Race and gender are increasingly major factors in hiring and promotion, which may or may not benefit you.
Advice to Management
Find ways to allow people who can't relocate every few years (or at all) to break through to higher pay scales. This isn't the 1950s where people have stay-at-home wives who can obediently move every few years to help their husband's career. Perhaps change the expectation from physically relocating to having responsibilities across multiple facilities?

Also, get on board with remote work and work-from-home. We're six months into WFH in the pandemic and the front-rank largely loves it and the company has suffered zero loss in productivity or organizational capability because people aren't in an office five days per week. Again, it's not the 1950s. We have excellent telecommuting tools and commuting to an office to do the same things you can do at home (most of the time) is an anachronism.

Advice to Management
Stop promoting non technical folks who make fancy presentations. They talk too much and say too little. Hold people accountable on the outcomes of projects. Stop moving people every two years. You end up with ppl who leave before their project is even complete and go into jobs they don't have the right experience for. Provide incentive for developing institutionalized local knowledge so we don't do everything for short term assignments. Don't put upstream ppl directly into downstream engineering and management jobs and vice versa. No wonder we're bottom quartile in performance in so many metrics! And then all management does is give us generic, lofty targets with little strategy on how to accomplish them... C'mon we can do better!

Benefits are good and they have done a good job with progressive programs like M.A.R.C that has allowed for employees at all levels to have open, candid and supposedly ""safe"" conversations around bias thinking, non-inclusionary practices, and other adverse type of topics that have historically been swept under the carpet. It's a program that ideally will help with molding a better culture that will eliminate the ""good 'ol boy"" mentality in Oil & Gas industry.
","Current internal hiring process/career development programs are not as inclusionary as it could be, specifically within the IT world.

","Volatile Oil & Gas industry, micromanaged and ranked for your performance by mid level Mgmt who don’t even know how to do your job, if you work hard and are good at what you do you get the slackers’ work as well, have meetings to decide when the next meeting is, want you to hurt working relationships by doing an NLI on your co-worker every month or quarter. And favoritism all over the place. Mgmt will have drinks on the weekends with their pet employees. They say they want you to speak up and give an opinion at meetings, but the people that don’t get laid off every other year when they have massive layoffs during a ROM are the same people who don’t say one word at meetings... or that have drinks with Mgmt on the weekends.
Advice to Management
If there’s a cross-training opportunity and an employee asks for that opp and truly wants to learn that task, let them. Instead of throwing someone in that position that has absolutely no interest in learning that job, hates it and loves what they’re currently doing. You’re just shooting your team in the foot when they could be so much happier and thus more productive as a whole. Upper Mgmt needs to support employees who have valid struggles with mid Mgmt instead of getting defensive and circling the wagons around the awful mid level Manager and alienating the employee like they are at fault. Safety is important but so is having enough time at your desk to actually do your job when you’re given deadlines.

Good base salaries if you are willing to forget all ethics and be a ""my way or the highway"" supervisor or employee.
","The company advertises multiple career opportunities but then management or supervisors limit career growth for their departments and direct reports. Chevron brands themselves as a diverse and equal opportunity employer, yet supervisors do not preach what they say and will limit their employees in order to keep good people in their team instead of letting them excel in other job opportunities within the company.

Many supervisors have a control issue. If you say one thing, they will make you do the opposite just so they can be right. I have heard from peers that the HR hotline number is useless, only creates more trouble and should never be used even though the company promotes the hotline. 

Inflexible work schedule. The company promotes work life balance yet the decisions rest in your supervisor's personnel interpretation of work life balance. No room for working remotely and your vacation plans are expected to be changed per the supervisor's request for internal fictitious corporate deadlines.

","It's the senior- and mid-level managers in Communications who are clinging to the old boys network, tapping the same (mostly white men) for plumb assignments and passing over better qualified candidates for the favored few. You lose your value the minute you walk in the door and they put you under some manager promoted to a role he has no business running. Once inside, promotions for those outside the inner circle are few and far between. Ranking in communications is based on personality and politics instead of hard work and real enterprise value. Employee surveys are massaged to keep the functional leads in control.
Advice to Management
Break up the Communications function - bring in new talent at all levels of management to enable the real talent to emerge.

I had good managers and bad managers while there. There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously. Working in IT, I've never experience a good work/life balance in my career, however Chevron has been the best company I've worked at to date for this balance.
","It's a very large organization which means it's somewhat bureaucratic. It actually operates as a cooperation which is mostly a negative because it is actually many independent companies working under a leadership organizations (leadership directive?) which means there are many misses in streamlining and drastically increases silos within the organization. Because of longevity of the people that work for the company (a good thing) there is a lot of mindset on outdated logic, process, and procedures, although Chevron recognized this and has been making conscience effort to migrate this and adjust this mindset. There are a lot of restructures and reorganizations within the company as the market for oil constantly shifts and adjusts.

","- Out-dated talent management practices. They still use personnel development committees to pay and rank people, which can lead to great inefficiencies (days upon days spent going over ratings and it leads to a highly political environment while also making employees feel undervalued). It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system.
- Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace.
- There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling. There are committees for literally everything that circle around with little impact and many people on these committees feel they need to critique things for the sake of saying they made a contribution to the committee.
Advice to Management
A culture change needs to happen with respect to faster decision-making and managing your talent. If not fixed, you will have a lot of trouble attracting and retaining the next generation of employees - especially in the Bay Area given the war for talent. Your employment proposition is outdated and the benefits have changed a lot (especially LTIP), so they are not as attractive or competitive as they once were for long-term employment.

Fri Nov 16 2018, Customer Service Representative,"Portland, OR",Former Employee ,"Chevron Stations is one of the worst places to work. Get experience when working here, then leave to get a better job.",3,"First off, Chevron Stations and other departments of Chevron should be separated because they are not the same. Chevron Stations is overloaded with low salary people who slack off during work, and who don't care about their jobs.

- Can slack off and do nothing while getting paid, because the managers themselves slack off themselves and let others to do so as well.
- Can break practically any rule of Chevron that you want because the managers don't care if you do so or not because they don't care for the company.
- Free fountain drinks.
","- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them.
- Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence.
- Management don't care about their job.
- Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage.
- If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all?
- In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps.
- Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day.
- Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves.
- Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job.
- Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company.
- No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something.
- Your salary is still low if you become management.
- Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math.
- You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management.
- Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. 


I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.
Advice to Management
My only advice is tell you management people that you only got the job because nobody else wants your job. You decided to stay with the company for some particular reason, and ended up deciding to move up in the company. Then you take our all of your frustrations onto your workers. You are all not qualified for your job.

Corporate themselves won't care about you, so no use to talking to them about it. My final advice to everyone is that because this company treats its low salary Chevron Stations workers like trash, you should treat them like trash as well. Use them only to get experience and get out of your job. Only give them a two weeks notice if you think you may have to apply to a corporate job with them later in the future if you become qualified enough. If not, show your appreciation back at them by quitting on the day your supposed to work by giving your store a friendly phone call.

Basically, there's is not advice to give to management or corporate, because they don't care about what you say. They say they do, but they actually don't. You are just a pile of replaceable low-salary trash to them.

","Refinery Experience:

The company has the worst business models I’ve come across. Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. 

Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. 

No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. 

There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. 

The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10? Would make so much more sense. I think the current system would be fine if there was more incentive to have employees perform at higher levels. If being a 2 was not just the general population employee.
Advice to Management
We need to rethink the way we write and control contracts. 
We need to focus on promoting leaders and recycle those that are just riding the wave. 
We need to re-evaluate the systems in place. There are roadblocks we have engineered into our standards. Let’s not get in our own way. 
We refine crude amazing. We don’t make programs to be used by the Chevon teams amazingly. Utilize the tools and programs that the companies make for a living. We will save tons when it comes to efficiency and overall headaches. 
We just did the Chevron surveys. Take the information in them and focus on making the changes. 
Lastly, there’s nothing wrong with a higher turnover rate due to pushing out people just riding the wave. That is good housekeeping. However, that’s not why ours is so high. It’s high because you’re losing future leaders that can’t stand to just go with the flow.

There used to be great qualities about the jobs at this company which have been all lost with bad management and poor decisions.
","- Continuous over-hiring and laying off trend never ended over the three years putting all employees at the edge of their seats and making it a very uncomfortable environment to work at. 
- Bad ranking system. The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you.
- Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. 
- No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. 
- All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. 
- There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. 
- When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. 
- I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. 
- They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. 
- As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years. Especially after the so-called reorganization that was done at the end of 2017, they kept lower salary grade people whom had been completely miserable at the assignments and working situations they were placed at.
Advice to Management
- Need to structure a better way to protect company assets during down turns of the oil price. 
- Avoid overhiring. 
- Find a fair way of ranking and performance evaluation. Standardize the process if this is a must.
- Actually follow the Chevron way. It is only a talk, but not an act at all. Stick with fit for purpose.

","Experienced hires will be severely underchallenged and not considered for growth opportunities; Chevron HR doesn’t care about anything you learned from any other company, even though their own HR practices are weak. This is a relationship and politics based culture that views performance as secondary, which means you have no chance relative to someone who has already been there 20 years. They hold positions exclusively for people from their own development program, even though they too are often ill equipped. The Chevron Way behavioral expectations lead to a friendly but artificial and passive-avoidant culture. About 50 percent of time is spent on bureaucracy vs real HR work. If you want money with minimal effort, this is a good choice. If you want to learn, grow and become a great HR professional, avoid.

Walk the talk and actually FOLLOW the Chevron Way as opposed to just talking about it all the time (when times are bad, not just when times are good).
Senior management can stress to middle management that they need to Set and Communicate Clear Expectations.

The PMP process is supposed to prevent this, but in my case it failed at a low point in the industry.)

Advice to Management
Evaluate your organizational culture bc it is failing. Leaders are mistreating employees and getting away with it. HR is not representing the employees but rather the abusive managers. 
Leadership performance should be measured/evaulated by both successes and lessons learned. EQ training should be mandatory. If more than 40% of a manager's team leaves/resigns within less than a year that should be a direct reflection of the managing supervisor. Turnover is extremely costly especially if you allow hostile a work environment to continue and avoid the root cause.

I worked at Chevron full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Good company to work for. Employees compensation is commensurate with experience and roles and responsibilities. Good training.
Cons
1.- Frequently on Resource Optimization Management (ROM) process. This means that employees are not sure if they will be laid off at any particular ROM process. 
2.- There are a lot of cases cases that job openings are posted for internal applicants (Chevron employees). However, they already have the candidate they want to fill that position. They do it to comply with the posting process, but this is only a show.
Advice to Management
Do not penalize regular employees with ROM processes all the time and then laying them off due to bad decisions made by high management and expose employees to the stress caused by not having a job after dedicating their best productive years to this company. High management should be held accountable for those bad decisions and get fired.

Thu Feb 23 2017, Financial Analyst,"San Ramon, CA",Current Employee ,Chevron has devolved into a dysfunctional bureaucracy,12,"-Culture was great when I started. They encouraged growth, training, and opportunity--but that's mostly ended. However, there's still a desire to keep that in place which is something at least.
-The 401k match AND pension are pretty much unmatched at any other employer I've heard of. 
-The 9/80 work schedule (one day off every two weeks) is great
","-Constant reorganizations, downsizing, job offshoring make this a pretty stressful, unsatisfying place to work as a US based employee.
-No rhyme or reason to the yearly evaluation process or raises/promotions. People are paid in payscales (PSGs), which are based more on luck and how well you've schmoozed than the actual job you're doing. One person may be paid $100k to do a job, get back filled by someone making $150k (cause that's what they made previously), and then the next person in the role may only earn $90k. I've seen it happen countless times. It doesn't matter how qualified you are to do a particular job, if you haven't locked in the next PSG you don't get paid more to do higher level jobs. I can't stress enough how damaging this process is to morale.
-Ridiculous cost cutting at every turn.
-Some people phone it in every day, and others at the same payscale work ridiculous hours. Again, pay has nothing to do with the difficulty of the job or how hard you work. I have friends at Chevron who spend half their day on the internet, others who work until 1 am several times a month. All get paid roughly the same amount.
-Recent MBA grads keep getting stuffed into the career ladder at the mid-management payscales meaning nobody else has any chance at getting promoted above senior analyst roles. This is something that picked up steam around 2012 and has caused a lot of friction internally. Despite constant offshoring, they haven't scaled back on these programs.
-People are streaming for the exit. Of the 20 or so people at my level that I'm friends with outside of work, at least 12 have said they're passively looking for other jobs--and 6 of them have left in the last 18 months.
-The CEO seems like a good guy, but the vibe of the company completely changed when he took over a few years ago. Could just be a coincidence cause I don't have anything against him personally and can't point to anything specific.
Advice to Management
Take an honest look at how you're running the Finance organization. It used to be a great part of the company with a lot of bright people, but it's collapsing in on itself. Cost cutting isn't the only metric of success. Promoting from within and giving more opportunity to top performers would go a long way.

Lastly, pay people to do a job, not based on the payscale grade they happen to be at. If you place someone in a higher level job, compensate them accordingly. Take a look at the development programs. There are far too many people going through them, and they're making gobs of money on the program, only to have half of them leave immediately after finishing. It's wasted money that would be much better spent on people who have been loyal employees for years.

","Recent deep slashes were taken in the company in the form of lay-offs and tightening of the proverbial belt in any way possible. There is a definite disconnect between lower-level employees and upper-level management. It seems every year that there is a new approach to how business will be managed and keeping up can be a nightmare. Huge gap to be jumped between lower pay scale grades and higher pay scale grades with no intermediate positions to bridge the gap. This company is entrenched in an old-timers mentality, where if you're part of the in-crowd, you'll sail through positions and advancements with ease and anyone else's hard work to get noticed and advanced goes unrewarded.

First and foremost is a well-though company culture the enhances Diversity, Cooperation and getting the job done the Right Way. Next, we have a very strong Project Management and Decision Making culture which helps insure we are tackling the right work and making the most appropriate decisions given the risks and costs. Lastly, its been a really interesting and challenging work environment--lots of new work and many opportunities to leverage what I have learned in new ways.
","It is a large company and somewhat bureaucratic. You really need to take a long term view of things since its not always easy to rapidly advance and move up. We are also very process oriented and getting things done can sometimes seem difficult as you navigate through all of the hoops.
Advice to Management
You are doing a lot of things very well at the moment. I think my best advice is to visible demonstrate your commitment to taking more risks, being more agile and more decisive. Easy to do when all goes right--the real test is how you handle things when it doesn't--despite everyone's best intentions.

I worked with a fair few awesome co-workers and the work was not really that hard, plus, for the area I was in..I felt the pay was decent. Though, I was also told that, for that area, the pay = minimum wage elsewhere.
","So many cons. Which is sad, because, when I first started, I LOVED my job! I'm not even sure where to start.
-They transferred the manager that was there when I first started, that set everything else in motion. Mostly.
-The Assistant Manager was lazy and useless.
-The manager they hired after they transferred the other, did not know how to deal with our store since it was different than their own (they had a smaller gas station store, we had more of a convenient store with hot food, coffee, etc). 
-The assistant manager was lazy and useless, and was no help to the new manager. individual also threw the former manager under the bus, claiming he didn't train her in this or that
-The other manager either got fired or quite, I don't recall. We had an acting manager from a different store.
-This manager, whom I had originally thought was pretty nice...was basically a wolf in sheeps clothing. Not in a good way.
-Assistant Manager continued to be lazy and useless, and after speaking up a fair few times, was still able to retain her position...
-I started getting blamed for things that I was not actually trained on, and then blamed for things not being done that I was, in my position, not allowed to do. Things that only managers and assistants can do.
-I really started to hate my job
-They hired a new guy to be the new manager, but he was in training
-Acting manager liked to run her mouth and talk crap about employee's behind their backs, heard her doing so about me to the manager in training.
-Acting manager got fired for forging assistant managers name on documents that the assistant manager never signed cause ""she didn't know"" she was supposed to (which, she did, cause she had before..)
-Assistant manager then thought she was going to become the new manager.
-Assistant manager then went from knowing nothing to apparently knowing her job...without further training
-I worked mainly graveyard, and I would come in at night to NOTHING being done that the assistant manager was supposed to do if it was her shift. There are times she would work my graveyard on my nights off..I would come in the next day and things had not been done for a few days.
-Assistant manager started training other employee's to be slackers.
-Assistant manager cared more about flirting with guys than her job.
-Assistant manager cared more about her phone than her job.
-I got sick of this job, went from loving it to hating it, and stopped caring. I ended up quitting with no notice.
-Assistant manager was still there a month and a half or so after I quit..
-...Not sure if assistant manager is still there, would not surprise me if she was
