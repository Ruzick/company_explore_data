","Very big on micromanaging, constant change, overall low employee moral, but the pros outweigh the cons so most stay for the benefits and deal with the misery and high blood pressure, depression, but from hundreds of employees in group chats most constantly question why they stay. It's like American puts some weird hold on you, once you drink the Kool-Aid. Most people are very educated with lots of talent and settle for the pay because of the flexibility and benefits.

Advice to Management
Ask employees what you can do to improve productivity. As a mechanic, there have been several occasions, where I'm just ""waiting on parts to come in"". I work in Tulsa, the largest maintenance base in the world- there is no reason I should have to wait an entire shift to recieve something as trivial as paint. In many cases, I can order something from another station and get it faster than if I were to order it from my own location. You pay me a lot of money while I'm just sitting around waiting on parts... wake up! Our customers need us to do this more efficiently!

Mon Feb 08 2021, Flight Attendant,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,It is a great job but senior leadership does not care for its employees.,0,"Union job, with decent pay after a few years.
","Management controls your life. The job is getting worse every year and then covid accelerated that. They can displace you with very little notice. The hours can be long but the real problem is the average rest time has gone way down. It is a safety focused job which is harder to do when you are always tired. I was displaced to a new city after 8 years with the company so now I commute which makes for even less rest and less time with my family. I may have used to recommend this job but not anymore. The company is so large and senior leadership does care about employees.
Advice to Management
Your decisions have a huge impact on our lives and the morale of the employees. Morale is very low, and in a ""face of the company position"" this is not good for a business. The communication surrounding recent decisions was terrible. Communication among flight crew is always stressed as important to the company but they can not lead by example. Forcing people out of their homes for ""slight efficiencies"" is not the right strategy, especially during a pandemic.

Sometimes your employees can sense as well as see that they aren't part of your ""In-Clique"" as you may have with some teams and/or individual employees, so by osmosis they are already in ""Outs"".

Sat Nov 07 2020, American Airlines Flight Attendant,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Being a Flight Attendant is Your Whole Life,0,"Not a bad airline to work for, flight benefits are not seniority based so if you want to travel a lot, even in your 1st/2nd year, you have just as good of a chance as your peers to get first class seats, etc. Starting pay is better than some of the competitors, and the flight service managers are all relatively nice people.
","Standby shifts are not fun, and some months if you are junior you could have an upwards or four to five standby shifts, your base pay is 30 or 32 an hr, but you only get 70-75 hrs a month, and depending on your base it can be very hard to pick up. The pay doesnt change depending on your base, so a Charlotte based FA and a NYC FA make the same, which makes it very hard to afford things if you are, for example, in NYC.

","First to furlough. Many pilots seem charged, and polarized against management, their union, or even other pilots depending on how they got to American. Old rivalries between America West and US Airways seem to not have subsided since the merger. Rather it seems like the merger only resulted in yet a third contestant namely the legacy American pilot group being thrown into the proverbial ""ring"" where each group battles over why they are better than the others and how the others made life miserable for them. Pilots are represented by the Allied Pilots Association which itself is just as divided as the pilot group and entrenched in a power struggle. Communication from the union to the pilots is sub-par which only fuels the rumor mill.
Advice to Management
ctrl+alt+delete! Engage with the pilot group , admit past mistakes but compel them to forgive the perceived sins of the past and convince them to agree to a new beginning. Treat them well and you might find that they become more willing to save fuel and achieve all around better performance numbers for the airline.

Wed Sep 23 2020, Flight Attendant,"Dallas, TX",Current Employee ,Mixed Nuts,0,"Free to ultra-low cost flights, ability to go somewhere on a whim (pre-covid) to see family and friends, different bases in different major areas across the country, junior flight crews are the best to work with.
","Little to no room for advancement as it is seniority based which is one of the roots of the problem. The airline celebrates the ""senior mama's and papa's"" when in reality, their best days are behind them. There isn't an FAA mandated age limit so you'll see FA's older than your grandmother on the line in a ""safety and security"" position which makes you question recurrent training processes and it creates a divide between older/junior crews. With furloughs looming, the toxicity ferments even more. Recent corporate ""wokeness"" and political pandering for more bailout money has only made matters worse. The union is weak and will ram through a new contract to benefit the seniors even more once the juniors are on a furlough with no ability to vote.
Advice to Management
Get your FSM's out of their offices and onto the line to lead and enforce the standards. Robert Isom stated Delta took a 20% pay cut to avoid furloughs, granted each company is different, but I'd rather make 80% of what I was making than none of it. Give up the political pandering and alienation of a portion of your workgroups with your wokeness. Push the seniors out.

We meet and work with people from all over the globe and diversity within the company is very valued. Flight benefits have allowed my family and me to travel all over the world. Insurance and time off is pretty good. There is some flexibility within my job, as other people can cover my shifts. Covid19 has changed so much and now there are so many furloughs. There have been so many ups and downs, from pandemics to terrorism to extreme weather issues, but overall, I am glad that I work for AA.
","Customer service at the airport for a major airline at a major hub means lots of cancellations when weather starts to affect flights and lots of sad and extremely irate passengers. You have to have lots of empathy and patience to deal with some of the barrage of anger directed at the agents. Hours can be extremely hard, with shifts starting at 230am for openers and for closers , when there are lots of weather delays, agents are sometimes leaving the airport when the morning shift is coming in. I don't recommend this company for now because of the massive layoffs with Covid19.

Working for the airlines there is always something that may not be in you schedule weather that is delays, weather, something happening at the airport that is unusual and needs to be handled, maintenance, waiting on a plane to arrive.

- Have 14 days vacation yearly, plus 4 holidays, 2 of which can be rolled to the next year
- work 5 days straight, 2 days off
- 3 different 8 hour shifts, which you can trade with other people to get more days off
","- management is controlling
- you do your job and follow the contract, but the boss's will give into what the flight attendants want (going against what the contract states) and making you look like you don't know your job, but you were following the rules
- flight attendants are not held accountable for anything that they say on the phone. (1 FA called a person on the phone the N word and kept their job with no consequences)
- There are rules made where FA's are not allowed to call our names out on social media, fellow co-workers got screenshots on the FA's FB group that they had done so and were dragging their names through the mud nothing was done.
- A fellow co-worker(white lady) in the department also got away with saying racial slurs and kept her job even though she constantly harassed people at work. Management of course also did nothing.
- they don't hold employees accountable for their mistakes, but always blame the next shift for not cleaning up after the previous shift. 
- management always make the hard workers work harder, while the ones who never know how to do the basic day to day tasks get a free pass every time.
- you can be a hard worker who comes in everyday (a lot of people noshow and get a pass), be on time (they gave incentives to bribe people to come in on time), never call in sick and they will fire you, before they ever fire the lazy ones who never do anything, don't know anything , and always make big mistakes.

Listen to your knowledge workers. They are competent and capable. Let go of the command and control system. The developers need to be able to experiment... don't continue with the feature factory approach. The new Product model is a good start, but finance is not agile and still doesn't get it.

","Leadership has their own agenda and if you 'push back' or go against the status quo they will let you know. They do not listen to their employees on what they need, nor do they support mental health and the need to work from home or have a day off. You get 2 days working from home a month - no more - no exceptions. Use them wisely. Management is not supportive or knowledgeable of what the 'worker bees' do and need to find a common ground vs 1 way or no way. Very manipulative and deceiving management tactics.

There is no upward mobility, and the ones in Manager roles are holding on tight to their jobs in fear of millennials outshining them. 

You need to be involved in projects to get noticed in the group, and if you aren't, you basically don't exist. Much of the back-end work is outsourced to a call center, leaving the internal team relying on them to slowly get things done. The entire process should be internalized without a 3rd party, so that the team can actually get things done correctly.

The new headquarters is nice.

Senior leadership seem committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work culture.

With so many team members from all over the world, the workforce is very enriching, diverse, and dynamic.

The company has championed DEI, especially for the LGBTQ community.
","Antiquated processes, policies, and procedures

Culture of mistrust, fear, and vindictiveness

Extremely hierarchical and level/title-driven culture

Reactive rather than proactive

Vague, inconsistent policies

Managers lack good leadership skills, don’t provide clear expectations or strategy, but are all too eager to tell you what you’ve done wrong.

HORRIBLE work-from-home culture and work-life balance. Almost non-existent. Stop providing people laptops if you won’t allow them to WFH—it’s 2020!

Internal resources (management and support staff) often don’t enjoy the perks or benefits internal teams at other companies enjoy for fear that it would anger team members in external-facing roles. 

Flexibility and work-life balance are often sacrificed for optics, not a legitimate business case

Constant chaos, disorganization, and dysfunction

Because everything centers on seniority, vacation, the ability to use travel “benefits,” and opportunities for advancement are minimal.

Lack of transparency—must be in the “good old boys’ club” or “secret fraternity” to understand what’s going on.

Team members at all levels are rude, mean-spirited, and phony.

Wed Nov 13 2019, Staff Assistant II,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Unfortunately Overworked,9,"Amazing flight benefits - it was a great way to explore the world!
","I worked for AA in the administration department in PHX & transferred to ORD 2 years ago. This transition was like night & day. When I first started with the company, I had every intention of retiring with them - that is how much I believed in the company’s mission “going for greAAt”. Everyone in PHX that I worked with displayed this mentality & it reflected in a collaborative team work environment. Although the work expected didn’t align with the pay they offer, that aspect didn’t bother me so much since I always felt they offered AMAZING benefits. Unfortunately, the company morale from PHX isn’t consistent with how ORD is run. 

Fast forward to life at ORD - the only reason why I choose to leave the company. 

During my short 2 year career in Chicago, I’ve grown to realize how the Administration Management staff didn’t utilize their resources available, nor did they offer any career development/goals. There was no team collaboration, and most importantly no type of support in my current roll within the Admin department. Monthly meetings were cancelled for more than a year, innovational ideas weren’t entertained, nor was there any flexibility with our schedules. 

Although I was given a position I didn’t even apply for, I thrived in it. Management saw this & continued to delegate more & more tasks making my current workload biased & unreasonable. When I started to feel the “burn out” I asked for assistance. To my surprise, management wouldn’t provide any. I was laughed at & told that “I had everything under control & it didn’t seem like I needed any help”. So I continued to thrive & make the most of everyday. After-all, where could I find another job with such great benefits?

Less than a month ago, we had a death in the family. I made the choice to separate from the company when I was told by management that my absences would be counted as unauthorized since I needed more than 3 days to grieve. This wasn’t the culture that I knew to be true at American & choose to no longer subject myself to these type of working conditions.

I get this is how most major corporations function, but their motto “going for greAAt” should be instilled within their Management & displayed consistently regardless of which department/HUB they’re from.

Thank you for the opportunity to learn and grow; thank you for opening up my heart to things I never knew I could do. It’s unfortunate that due to “re-organization” you lost sight of what matters most - team work.

Myself as well as my colleagues felt the burn out & I know it would be greatly appreciated if the feedback provided to you annually was acted on. I wish you all the best of luck!

Advice to Management
1. Hire Robert Cecil Martin to fix your Agile initiative.
2. Put a maintenance technician on every flight until you have atoned for your 737-Max mistake, and restored the public's faith in your safety decisions.

Let people do their jobs. Trying to convert the whole IT organization to Agile has been a disaster. Agile has always been about empowering small teams to execute on innovative ideas. Cramming this down a multi-siloed organization with broad mandates has been an incredible waste of time. The ra-ra-ra cheerleading that management would need full buy-in to Agile from day one missed the number one reason for using Agile, which is empowering the small teams. 

The ""one size fits all"" methodology for rolling out Agile, in the absence of standard deliverables was also a huge waste of time. The Agile team leads saying that management needed metrics from the individual Agile iterations was in stark contrast to best practices of Agile deployments and showed that IT was just looking for scapegoats to blame. In the midst of the Agile rollout, there was a number of management positions cut, and decreased productivity due to chaos caused by frequent musical chairs that the remaining managers as they were reassigned scrambled to prove their relevance. 

American Airlines has gone through bankruptcy before and in my opinion they are one oil shock away from having to declare bankruptcy again. Look for things getting tight around 80-90 dollars a barrel for oil... 

We also know now that the whole Boeing 737-MAX fiasco was because of a design to their specification and that was all about cost cutting measures that cost the lives on two flights that crashed and killed all aboard. I would not recommend anyone work here as they barely seem to know what they want let alone what they need from an IT perspective. Knowing what I know about the IT side of the house I shudder to think what their maintenance and repair operations look like! I recommend that an aircraft mechanic fly on every flight until the public confidence is restored in AA's safety decisions.

Finally, the cafeteria was decent in fort worth, but alas that was a third party that was contracted to provided the food!

Tue Oct 29 2019, Senior Manager,"Fort Worth, TX",Current Employee ,Great career and leadership opportunities! Culture is hit or miss depending on your leaders/organization.,2,"I continue to have great leadership and career opportunities. I love the people I work with. Looking back at when I started at American, I’m amazed at how much I’ve learned, my personal growth, and the exciting work I get to do every day. I come to work thinking, “do you know who I am? Are you sure you want to trust me with all of this?!” Amazing opportunities!
","Culture and bureaucracy is sometimes a drag. Depending on who your leaders are and the organization you work in, you can have drastically different professional and cultural experiences. I’m thankful for the experiences I’ve had, but many of my colleagues have had drastically different experiences. On the topic of culture, I’m sometimes amazed at how my team and I are treated by leaders around the company. I wonder if I can see myself at American long-term if the culture, personalities and behaviors of our leaders today is acceptable and does not change.
Advice to Management
It’s ok to strengthen your voice at the table. Decentralized decision making and empowerment is great, but not at the expense of organizational infighting and political maneuvering. We’re slow because we don’t pick a specific path and align around it. Help rally us to one unifying direction, and hold us accountable to that alignment.

","Management doesn't appreciate you as a manager yourself. They only care for the union employees. Everyone tries to stab you in the back just to get one step higher. Equal opportunity is getting out of control with AA, as you can see people of color and women climb the ladder faster than white males with more education, more experience, and better qualification. I am all for equal opportunity but to be passed up for the only reason that they need more ""diversification"" in upper management is not right. (I was told this by a VP)

Our management team lacks grossly in innovative thinkers. No one speaks out in an effort to move the company forward. Decision makers who develop policy on how the people on the ground handle day to day issues with passengers have never experienced the job. Therefore these policies backfire.
