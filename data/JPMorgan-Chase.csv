","The annual salary increases/bonuses are a joke. Even when it’s an “up” year for the firm, employees got the same story that the bonus pools were smaller and it was a tough year - never expect a major bump in salary or bonus - even on promotion years.
Advice to Management
You pay more to hire external people instead of rewarding those who have remained loyal to the firm and who have longevity.

","It is a large organization with constant change that can be hard to keep up with. You need to be there for a while to understand which system to request to get something done. If you have an issue of some sort, it could take a while finding the right ticket system or person to help. Most help is in a chat room or FAQ as self help. Expectations are that you will cultivate your career, constantly grow and give more. That can be both a pro or con.

Operations leadership needs to be straight with staff about the firm's priorities. Technology staff should partner with the business vs. push ""good enough (but not really)"" solutions. Work/Life balance is preached, but not allowed to be practiced.

Advice to Management
Make sure annual reviews are based on title level and not expectation. For example,I've been performing at a VP level for several years. My managers and peers expect a certain level of quality that I know is above my pay grade and title. But my reputation is stellar. So I deliver. Still I'll get a review based on these standards, which should be a pay grade higher than where I am.

Advice to Management
Diversity and inclusion can be improved. It should not be a slogan touted in certain times, but should be acted on with discipline. For example, managers should be measured by how well they create and foster an environment that values diversity and inclusion; how they manage unconscious biases; how they develop talents from different backgrounds / who look different from themselves; how they listen to voices that differ from their own... Simply meeting quotas for hiring a few select races will not deliver the true benefits of D&I.

Extremely hands off, doesn't care about employees' work-life balance while he works 9:30-5, (I've not had a one on one with him since he joined the Team in August 2020,) never attends important calls he's invited to, has no idea what goes into a process and places too many new demands on workers, and manages up like I've never seen in my 15 year career.

Senior, diverse MDs continue to leave the Legal department which speaks volumes of the firm and the department. Been here several years, worked extremely hard, get along with people, told no raises or promos every single year.

Invest more in technology salaries. Time and again people leave because technology is an afterthought. For a company that stresses that they are technology first company, you still have the old-timey mindset that front office should get all the money and technology should get the scraps.

Advice to Management
Chase prides on career mobility but several times I've overheard how opening positions were being given to friends and acquittances of whoever was hiring. The job posting will still be posted but very few candidates were called for an interview. I know this because of highly qualified coworkers who never got called for an interview. We would later find out someone outside of Chase would get hired for the job who were coincidentally acquainted to the hiring manager. My advice would be to have a third party hiring person who would do interviews with the hiring managers to make it fair. There is a lot of favoritism.

Tue Nov 17 2020, Senior Tech Recruiter,,Current Employee ,"Overworked, undervalued, politics, way too much red tape",1,"Looks good on a resume
","The red tape is really mind blowing, and in my opinion and experience - the more you are there, the more your job becomes administrative and away from your core job function. I used to be a top tech recruiter, but now me and most of my colleagues are basically glorified data administrators in my immediate experience over several years here, Nd what I’ve seen with others 

Leadership is out of touch, outdated, and way too interested in data for the appearance of having data vs. actually performing a job or using that data to action things or influence change with the business, in my opinion 

Pay is not as competitive as they make it seem, both to internal employees and external candidates. The brand name is heavily used to sell the opportunity 

If you are in tech recruiting, be prepared to work 50-70 hours a week, if you work in the US...

Very micromanaged 

Diversity and inclusion programs are heavy in appearance, but the business is not held accountable in my experience 

Strong performance is seemingly not rewarded beyond being told to be happy you have the job, based on my experience and my coworkers in 2020 going into 2021, similar with 2019, 2018 and previous years too
Advice to Management
Support your team when they ask for help, especially when 100 of them out if the 130+ team are saying the same thing...for years. 

Make internal promotions more common for high performing employees, and reward strong performers vs. giving no accountability to low performers

Tech recruiting leadership at MD and ED level needs to be exchanged entirely. In my view, they seem to be out of touch with modern recruiting and probably haven’t done it hands on in many, many years
