","Many decisions at the executive and board level over the past 5-7 years have diluted the company's focus. Oil refining is what originally made the company great but it has heavily invested in other ventures. It's questionable whether these fit with and support the company's core competencies. If you've read Good to Great and specifically about the ""doom loop"", that mentality seems to pervade a lot of the culture and decision-making.

It also doesn't help that regulatory and market conditions have made oil refining an increasingly difficult industry to operate in. The company is adapting the best it can, but some of the conditions have reinforced the negative mentality towards oil refining at the executive and Board of Directors level.
Advice to Management
Remember that oil refining is what originally made the company great. Stick to the basics and, if you believe in your core business, invest heavily in it rather than anywhere else.

Mon Apr 18 2016,N/A,"Artesia, NM","Pipeline Controller in Artesia, NM",Stay Away,7,"Decent pay when they are not trying to screw you out of overtime or holiday pay.
","The control center is highly sexist as there is not a single female controller working within, and on a monthly basis one of their long time employees loves to have very unprofessional/harassing conversations with the other employees. If you are part of the ""club"" you can make as many mistakes as you want and never get fired, however if you are not part of the club you will be crucified after one or two mistakes. Management was virtually non-existent, when they were around micro managing was non-stop, all fellow employees are only looking to cover their own instead of working together as a team and will not hesitate to throw one another ""under the bus"".
Advice to Management
Get someone in to manage the control center that actually cares about the employees and listens to what the controllers have to say about the software problems/includes them in the decision making process on what they think needs to be done. Pay the industry average, stop being so cheap this is an oil company.

Mon Oct 05 2015,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Stay away from Cheyenne!,4,"Can quickly gain a lot of experience, as at any refinery. There are some good people who a good to work with and top level management has a good strategy and good stated values.
","The culture at the upper levels is vastly different than the real culture among operators, maintenance and front line engineers. Middle management becomes a wall between what the company says its values and priorities are and what they really are. They also react very poorly to suggestions for safety or improvement from front line workers. The entire middle management team in Cheyenne is ex-military with very little or no refinery experience which causes them to be easily threatened by any suggestions regarding safety or best practices. It also leads them to make some very risky calls without every realizing it. Cheyenne has a very poor safety record and very high risk tolerance (far higher than should be acceptable in this industry) - the only thing between this refinery and a major incident or death is luck. As stated in other comments, crude and racist comments are common both among front line workers and middle management. 

Other refineries in the company seem better, but stay away from Cheyenne!!!
Advice to Management
Hire managers with experience who can lead this refinery into a stronger safety culture and prevent a major accident.
