I think management is doing great. Intel is moving away from the old ways of working.

Please make sure to drive the importance or work/life balance.

- Have always felt comfortable speaking up when a product is not going smoothly without fear of retaliation from management
","- Like any large company, sometimes you are restricted to explore outside of your current domain; you tend to fill a specific niche
- Progress upwards can be challenging as only 1-2 people on each team might get a sizeable pay bump / promotion each year
- Constant re-org changes; you build up rapport with a certain manager only to have them leave (tale of a big company)
- Pass-downs of products occur often and can be problematic if other teams are not responsive and you are on the receiving end

","Lower level leadership doesn't listen very well to their employees. During organizational level sensing surveys, when it's obvious that there is a problem within the organization from the top down, the leadership often doesn't recognize it's stemming from them.

","Ever since the COVID-19 ""pandemic"" lockdowns and masking mandates, this company has been the most tyrannical and draconian I have ever experienced. I despise showing up to work ever since this started in March and every chance I get for lunch or break, I drive as far as possible whenever possible. Feels like a prison complex; no freedoms no fun, no nothing!

Horrid leadership that gets promoted based on their gender or skin color or sexual orientation to fill in the quotas; not based on actual experience. Disgusting. They treat disabled military vets like trash and place them in positions that are even worse for their disability. Been here for well over a year and have yet to see one single promotion irregardless of how hard I work.

Nightshifts are the worst: even on your days off, it is nearly impossible to transition to see daylight. Basically, your family life is non-existent if you are married or have children, or even desire to have a social life.

Training: non-existent. You get thrown in the deep end and basically try and figure it out on your own. If you make a mistake, you basically get chewed out and embarrassed before everyone.

Needless to say: actively searching for another position ASAP. Cannot wait to quit.
Advice to Management
Don't low-ball your recruits with false hopes of bonuses. Base pay should still be competitive. 

Don't promote inexperienced people into leadership roles just because of their gender or race or whatever: you are ruining the quality of your leadership and your company. Hire people based on experience, not silly degrees only. 

Stop treating healthy people as if they are all sick and forcing masking mandates, temperature checks, etc - we are adults and know how to take care of ourselves if we have the flu or any illness.

Stop cramming your leftist progressive agenda down everyone's throat. It is really upsetting and disgusting and not very ""inclusive"" of you.

","The company seems to have lost its focus over the years. There have been some amazing advancements, but they have come at a big cost. Culture, focus, direction all shake out from this.

Advice to Management
Help Interns land jobs, or connect them with hiring managers. Interns aren't just cheap labor (compared to employees), they are people that took the internships for a potential future career at Intel. If you don't have a potential job lined up for an intern to take, then don't offer an internship, and let them work for a different group that does.

Sun Dec 06 2020, Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,Typical enterprise and big company sadness,0,"Supposedly really good health insurance. 401k match (I believe), RSU (stock grants), bonuses, all that. Pay may or may not be competitive, see note below about inside of IT.

If you're female and especially a person of color, you'll have a really good chance of being hired, regardless of experience. The emphasis on diversity is strong. Years ago (before this recent push!) we were told that out of the candidates who applied, if we did not choose the woman, we had to justify that to a VP. A VP mind you that has no idea what we actually need. There used to be crazy large referral bonuses the more unique of a hire you could find. Get that koosh large company job, find a nice place to settle in and eventually become a manager that is simply just a warm body in a chair.
","The IT organization is mismanaged and horrible. Some of the main culture pillars include ""customer orientation"" and everything in IT goes against that. Nobody has faith when you're told to ""go to it.intel.com and submit a ticket"" that it's going to be done properly. The system doesn't allow for easy rerouting. It's full of third world support people shoving tickets around, not understanding the issues. Anything above ""can you turn it off and on again"" type stuff is an absolute joke. This same system is what everyone uses be it ""my laptop won't turn on"" to a huge advanced IT project's support. The lower tiers have no idea what those things are and usually the ticket is DOA.

Let's not forget the push to SAFe. What a joke! Our fearless CIO Paula introduced it as part of this ""digital transformation"" and it's been a slow burning dumpster fire. Classes forced on how the process is supposed to work (designed by an amazing third party vendor!) and then immediately thrown out because Intel wants to do things ""their way"" anyway. The consistent ""one size fits all"" approach coming from the top down (while simultaneously wanting us to ""be fearless"" and challenge the status quo and all that) stifles real innovation or ability to meet specific needs with the right solutions. I could go on for years, but they've done two rounds now of large amounts of IT layoffs in the last 3 years alone, and I've had 6 or 7 managers in that time. I did enjoy my job well enough for many years outside of IT. The company itself is known for high stress, in general. Add to that the IT organization's continuous desire to cut costs and eventually heads when there's no more costs to cut... why would you want to work there?

Also, funny tidbit - the IT organization pays less for the same exact job that is located elsewhere in the company. Not that any of those really exist, since geniuses at the top decided that everyone who does IT work should be in the IT organization. Remember: one size fits all. If it doesn't fit, it will eventually. Think square peg in round hole being jammed in there until one side breaks.

Another con, probably true of any large company - too many managers, too much management. We have new VPs every month. It's insane. We have the wrong people doing things all over the place. People who have no clue making certain decisions but are empowered to make them anyway. Or ""skilled"" labor that can't seem to even form a single thought. I don't know how some of these people can even find the bathroom without assistance.

When I was hired, I was given stock options. They expired before they were ever worth anything. Nowadays they issue RSUs for things, which are much better. But I was stuck getting absolutely nothing for my hiring ""bonus""

To summarize: this is not a place you want to work if you're going to be inside of the IT organization. Inside of a business group, sure, it can be alright. Manufacturing, sure. But IT? Run for the hills.
Advice to Management
Bring in someone who can manage the IT organization properly. Not the latest woman or woman of color who looks impressive to the board. (Nothing against women, but it feels like some of the management decisions are purely for a good public appearance.... nobody really brings a decent culture shift with them.)

Make sure management has the right credentials and don't come from another enterprise company. We just keep winding up with the same result over and over again. SAFe was a joke from the beginning, and nobody can honestly say that the company is functioning any better. The way the organization is setup needs to be redone, not compartmentalized, not dressed up with ""fun"" team names. If anyone outside the company watched the quarterly planning meetings they'd think it was a more boring version of Office Space. All the output from it winds up being a long list of dependencies on different teams, but no real way to resolve them. Instead of having dependencies amongst compartmentalized teams, how about having teams made up of the that appropriate resources aligned together? I understand that is scary from a cost efficiency standpoint, but I guarantee it will be more efficient long term.

Also, each round of layoffs winds up leaving large craters in tribal knowledge and impact. They don't seem to have any rhyme or reason to who is chosen, and many teams and customers are going to suffer. Nobody is being backfilled properly. I've seem my team reduced to half its size naturally with no effort to backfill with appropriate resources, just interns. The obsession with keeping headcount low is sad. There is zero feeling of any sort of loyalty. I know long term Intel people who are considering looking elsewhere and bringing their knowledge with them. Very key and critical people. They don't want to be blindsighted by the next round of layoffs.

Cross company integrity and direction needs improvement,0,"Working with smart, highly skilled and competent individuals is very satisfying when designing and executing projects. Messaging about work-life balance, diversity, inclusion and results seems to come from the right place even if not always the reality, although I do appreciate their effort to create inclusive company language on official documents. Benefits are very good and most managers are flexible on off time after covering weekend or night time projects. 

Good training opportunities for the most part, good ergonomic programs, and good pay. Skype meetings are at least 2X as effective as old in person meetings.

Most people are open to answer questions or help train you on certain items. This saves a lot of time.

Since covid start, direction and decision making seems to have improved. Not sure if this is from increased company cohesion or from Engineers and management not being as exhausted when making decisions.
","Low integrity between modules and with some upper management to mid level managers, sometimes questionable data is requested to be “modified”. Pressured to hide data or not confront easily predicted excursions until upper management prioritizes the item after excursion occurs. Lots of time wasted on unnecessary items that are company wide not module specific priorities that leave little time for more important development items. Surprisingly, more then you would think # of instances of coworkers referring to colleagues as slurs(like universally considered bad ones), calling out of problem is ignored, there seems to be a reason Intel has issues retaining certain demographics.

Ability to call out root cause issues seems to be primarily determined by seniority opposed to robustness of model. Issues and solutions are sometimes investigated in this same manner leading to lots of time wasting. Not all managers willingly share data or reasons behind certain decisions that affect your area or ability to close on items. Usually they are experienced enough where this is not an issue, but sometimes bad calls are made since no one has the big picture and data sharing can be limited. 

One should expect to work nights and weekends for project items routinely. This is not for everyone but a required part of the job.
Advice to Management
Request increased truth and transparency from managers. Sometimes questionable data gets presented to meet timelines, where the experiment/test really needs to be repeated to validate. Might be better for managers+engineers to own up when presenting data that is not iron clad or report preliminary data.

Wed Nov 18 2020, Mechanical Technician,"Hillsboro, OR",Current Employee ,Strangest Job I've Ever Had - Extremely Poor to No Communication and I am Paid to do Nothing,3,"1) Intel's benefit package is a bit above average: medical, vision, dental, lawyer on retention, 401k 4% match, commuter benefit, HSA, FSA, Dependent Care Assistance Program, EAP, adoption assistance, education reimbursement, and on site amenities like a gym, a vision clinic, a bank, a mobile dental office, a massage studio, a mother's room, multiple cafes (currently serving free meals due to COVID), and free shuttle buses. There is also profit sharing, bonuses, and other financial incentives which can add multiple thousands of dollars to your annual salary/wage.

2) Employee performance isn't punitive in nature and meant to empower improvement through transparency - meaning that at every manager 1:1 session you're shown how you're doing and talk about it so there's no surprises at the end of the year review. 

3) There are employee resources for help if there are issues - like a warmline for staff to talk about work-related issues and come up with a plan with the warmline to help the issue(s) to improve. (note that you need to know these exist and how to find them) 

4) There are various employee career improvement/development programs like a buddy and a mentorship program (note that you need to know these exist and how to find them).
","The biggest issue I've had is that I was hired, given an initial training called their NEO program, which we were told to hurry through online, and then I've been sitting with nothing to do for months since. It took me a week and a half to figure out who my manager was & my manager wasn't responsive when emailed. It took me weeks to figure out if I was supposed to be doing something, and when I ran out of tasks that I figured out, I've been trying desperately to make my own work since. I'm someone that thrives on staying busy, and this has been very hard for me. I have contacted everyone that I can think of, like HR and their Warmline, for help & so far change is not happening. Additionally:

1) It's extremely difficult to get hired at Intel as they get their ""pick of the litter"" due to their reputation and name. It took me multiple years of applications to get in.

2) Communication in general is very poor and I don't know enough to know who to report poor communication to or how/where to look to find answers.

3) Intel's outsourced their general IT and HR to 3rd parties, and this has so far not only resulted in appalling customer service but leaves me with no avenues to report poor service to since they don't mention who they report to or what agency/agencies they are. 

4) You are completely on your own to figure out everything at Intel. No one tells you anything. 

5) Intel (for reasons I understand) is very abbreviation and acronym heavy, and unfortunately, the internal vocab definition site is extremely lacking, so most jargon goes over my head and I have no resources to help me understand them. 

6) Management appears to have no idea you even exist. I have no idea who my co-workers are as well.

7) As a former contractor, this one bothers me a lot - there is definitely a caste system at Intel between the ""green badges"" (temps/contractors), ""ice blues"" (employees with a defined employment term), and the ""blues"" (employees). It's dreadful. I watch the ""green badges"" get yelled at and talked down to by the blue badges, and some people won't talk to you without you sharing the same badge color.
Advice to Management
1) Have a much more robust new employee hiring process that pairs you with a buddy from day 1 (this is apparently supposed to happen but didn't happen at all with me) so that you can learn about Intel and how to do your job.

1A) Have a robust checks and balances system in place to make sure this is happening. 

2) 1:1 meetings with your manager should happen by far more often than once every few months when you're first hired. 

2A) Have a robust checks and balances system in place to make sure this is happening. 

3) There should be a robust website with jargon defined so that new employees don't feel lost and left out during team meetings.

4) There should be multiple levels of communication expected - like co-workers introducing themselves, managers sending out team emails and having team meetings on a regular basis, and higher level managers reporting via emails and meetings on a less frequent but still regular basis.

5) A check-in system with new hires to make sure things are going well vs. leaving them completely adrift like myself. I've lost a lot of respect that I've had for Intel and have felt completely demoralized and discouraged from being ignored for months. 

6) I've had a few examples of a ""hurry up and wait"" environment as well - like there are web based trainings that you have to do in a specific time frame, but they're not relevant to your job (from what I can tell) & then there's nothing to do until training will suddenly pop up that's due very quickly again. I've also been told that I'm behind my peers, whoever they are, and that's frustrating because I'm given no guidance and limited training. I think that any ""hurry up and wait"" model should be re-examined - trainings should be proactive, not reactive in nature.

","While an employee in their Technology Manufacturing Group, I reported another employee for assaulting someone only to see the assaulter face little or no recourse. Furthermore, in mid-January 2020, as a vendor for another company, I was given 24 hours of notice to handle an escalation in China. This was at the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic. Intel didn't inform me of any virus before I traveled yet, upon my arrival, all of the China-based Intel employees were fully aware of a virus. I was not supplied any safety equipment and no preventative measures were instructed while on Intel's campus. After leaving China for safety concerns and returning to work in America, two of my coworkers displayed COVID-like symptoms a week later. This behavior is outright reckless and negligent! Assaulting people should not be tolerated and safety is Intel's self-proclaimed top priority. How can they miss such a huge oversight?

They are known for being very ethical, but the truth is the culture is to hide what isn’t ethical. Legal instructs people to not put things in writing so they can’t be sued. This kind of mentality leads to hiding the truth and creating groups that watch each other’s back. So lots of unethical treatment occurs, including sexual harassment and workplace bullying.

Reduce the levels of hierarchy and empower more to make actual decisions. You talk about it but you don't in practice enable individuals to make decisions. Even the smallest detail has to be ratified by a VP/GM.

- Front line managers were eliminated such that if you are not very senior you will not be a manger. The biggest problem with this approach is the managers don't know and or don't remember how to do the jobs of the junior and senior analysts.
- Most of the work that you would cut your teeth on and grow with the company has been outsourced to (LCG) Low-Cost Geographies. Thus there is no foundational knowledge to be gained as to how to really get into the core FP&A skills.
- Given it is up or out, you are in direct competition with both your peers and your manager. Each manager in your organization will want to know about what you are doing and as much as possible claim it as something they thought of, directed, led etc... so that they can claim in as an accomplishment on their yearly review.

Advice to Management
Be upfront and truthful to your employees, Stop beating around the bush and trying to play politics. If you are trying to destroy the company before TSMC/Samsung or any others takes over tell the workers well in advance so they can prepare for the lay offs and job searches

Listen to, supply and help the People on the floor, more than the people trying to stay relevant in the offices. You are a diamond currently not a pyramid. Too much in the middle, nothing at the base 

Make a perfect chip, Stick to it, if you improve it make it the next model (You are Intel, GO BIG or don't do it), stop adding Pluses, Your competition is real good at one chip, then learns from it, then makes another chip with all the upgrades and improvements with a NEW name, not a plus, then repeats process

Arizona will miss you when you are gone, But we will survive

Intern Benefits:

• Intern Acumen series
• Intern showcases
• Lunch with Intel’s CEO

Great competitive compensation even for interns. Flexible hours, paid vacation time off, the company culture is very inclusive and excels in this area.

Managers are very team-oriented and are super supportive of whatever the team needs while still being able to meet company goals.

Lots of opportunities to network and meet amazing like-minded individuals while on the job as well!
","There are not any cons that I can think of off the top of my head. Honestly working for Intel has increased my standards for a work environment and I won't be settling for any less here on out.

Tue Aug 18 2020, Process Engineer,"Chandler, AZ",Current Employee ,Has its moments,0,"The best thing is that in a way you get to make your own job. You can focus on the problems you're good at and find more interesting and you'll slowly find that these start to become your manager's expectations. There is a variety of tasks and interesting problems. You aren't forced to be a cubicle drone (which the office is quite open and sunny btw) and the option to work inside of the Fab adds good spice to the job. The TC with all bonuses included is decent for entry level.
","Unrewarded hard work, on-call, bad work-life balance. Attending late night meetings or working 10+ hours during difficult times is expected and not appreciated. They claim the promotion is merit based but truly it is more time-based and the difference between busting your butt or just doing as required is very little. Yearly raises on a ""phenomenal"" year are 3% so I can only imagine how these upcoming years will look with 7nm delay. Much of the learning you do is Intel specific and so doesn't make your career stronger. Also there is a fair amount of people that are difficult to work with and take it all too seriously, which amplifies the difficulty and stress of the job.

In addition to being a highly intelligent and motivated group, there is a real sense of community and a sense that every one around you wants to see you succeed. This is due at least in part to a strong corporate culture, which the upper management seems to take seriously. 

Also, you know that you are working on the design and production of cutting edge technology that we all use daily, which makes it easy to be proud of the work that you are doing.
","After working 20+ years on Intel design teams, I can tell you that burn-out is a real issue. While the culture is great at keeping people motivated and happy doing their work, it might be working a little too well. It's common for people to work long hours for extended periods of time and to not take their full allotment of vacation time. To their credit one of the Intel benefits is a sabbatical every four to seven years, but it's common for people to push those out as far as they can due to an underlying pressure to perform.

","This position depends a lot on your shift. You may get lucky and be on a shift were everyone contributes or you may be on the shift that no one wants to be. Management does not care about your breaks since and they will be demanding for more and more... you need to know when to STOP overworking if not they will take advantage from you by being a hard worker. Saying so... the better you become the most likely they will NOT approve your vacations because guess what? they are always short on people so since you are a valuable asset for the company (since you do more than average people) they will excuse on the fact that there are not enough qualified people as you. As I said before it depends a lot on the shift, if you get lucky you may be on a decent shift that would allow you to grow but at the same time they will respect your breaks/lunch but if not well... you know what to expect. I have been on both sides and trust me you do NOT want to be in a bad shift but if you are new to intel you will not be able to tell so do your research if you know someone inside before accepting the job unless you like to be under a lot of pressure.

I worked in Storage, NAND/Optane storage, and it was a very good experience- the dept ran like it's own company, lots of opportunity, esp in Linux SW design projects. At one point the storage dept was projected to ship more silicon than Intel's CPUs which is crazy.
","red tape, tech growth a little muddled, IT laptop support still all Windows (hello, macOS and Linux laptops anyone), there are bad depts out there to make u miserable.

The storage dept got relocated to the Aloha campus, which is a campus where basically engineering growth (esp SW) dies because lets face it- the Jones Farm, Hawthorne Farm and Rhonler Acres is where all the RandD is happening and you are on your your own forgotten island at Aloha (Intel's first Oregon building).

Also, at the end of the day, if you really want a modern career in SW, you'll need to leave the company. Intel is not a SW company though there is SW work; however it's really hard to find the latest and greatest SW opportunities at Intel. I started realizing the danger of me becoming obsolete in the SW industry when I attended a few external conferences. I was also severely underpaid as a SW design engineer and had to get a few external offers (one I obviously eventually took) to prove to management what I thought I was worth was true, especially since I was doing the role of 1.5-2 heads (design + QA).
Advice to Management
Don't want to lose a valuable SW engineer? Pay attention to SW price market. Support more SW career growth and projects and don't trap SW engineers on concentrating on their powerpoint skills as they become more senior- they should still get some SW opportunities with their veteran experience.

When I retired from Intel no one from HR reached out to see why a technical female would be leaving the company. This was despite the focus at that time on retaining technical females. I guess they just didn't want to know why I couldn't take it anymore. Fortunately for me I was able to retire.

Advice to Management
Management has done a fantastic job trying to fix issues with upward transparency so that everyone has at least some exposure to broader level BU plans. They should continue this effort for OneIntel. 
There is still too much variation between managers. I've had managers that not only have zero clue how to effectively manage a large team and project and actively point fingers to other Intel teams, but also give zero attention to professional growth. I've also had managers that land on the complete other end of this spectrum, being true leaders while fostering individual development. Managerial hiring should become more stringent. 

The effort for transparency should also extend into pay as well. The canned ""Depends on the budget"" and ""Hard to say"" manager-playbook responses when asking about promotions and pay raises seem to be reflecting in the growing attrition rate.
