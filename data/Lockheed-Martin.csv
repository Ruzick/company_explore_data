Wed Feb 03 2021, Mechanical Design Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA",Former Employee ,Good place to do some cool engineering,0,"First of all, I worked here a long time ago when there was more spacecraft design in Sunnyvale. (2008) They moved a lot of that after I left and I'm sure things have changed some. 
Engineering, for the most part, is king on campus. Most managers have a strong background as engineers which gave me a sense that we're all part of a team and bringing our experience to bear on the problem. As a young engineer I really enjoyed the cool headed offhand wisdom some older engineers would drop around a conference table. 

I enjoyed the need to get things right. Most things we worked on were ""high value hardware"", so you'd really like to do things right, not have ""anomalies"" on orbit. So it's fun and challenging because you've got to dig into everything that could go wrong and make it so it positively can't happen. 

It's fun and a little other worldly to work next to a towering satellite in a clean room high bay. Fun to see your designs come to reality then know that they'll be on orbit for the next 30 years.

With so many people on campus we could field 9 soccer teams. Good fun one day a week to meet directors and engineers from other departments on the field.

I did everything from 60-70 hour overtime weeks, sometimes meeting at midnight with the customer on ""in flow"" projects, to pretty normal office weeks. Work life balance is up to you. For me I could generally bite off as much as I wanted.
","There's a rumor that some managers weren't great at engineering and thus ""failed up to management"". I might have experienced some of this and it gave me the opposite feeling I listed in the ""pros"" section.

Many ""flight"" projects are ""legacy"" and thus very slow moving. You can't just design something new and launch it into space on the government dime. So a lot of what gets done is certifying, asking people to approve, tending to flight details. A flight design could take years to get launched.

However, I soon found that designing manufacturing hardware was faster and thus more fun. Still, it could easily take 6 months+ to push designs through review boards and such. 

Some aspects of satellite design were pretty top down. For example, each team was given a weight budget. If they made their budget everything is okay. As a designer I could have shaved off some weight pretty easily on a few projects. I typically requested to do so, but was met with indifference or opposition because we were already under budget. If it were less top down I'm sure lots of little improvements could be made. I see the reason for this but was a little annoyed at the time not to push this high performance hardware to ""high performance"".

","Some legacy managers expect you to work unpaid overtime after reaching a certain level. Younger generations aren't getting pensions though.

-Flexibility. Start and end your days how you like, as long as you hit 40 hrs per week. Might need to pull extra hours on occasion for deadlines. If you have classified work that needs to be done in the office, you currently have the flexibility to do your unclassified work from home to minimize time in the office.
-Plenty of opportunity to branch out. So many different projects and areas, and it's relatively easy to get in touch with other managers if you're interested in switch projects/positions. 
-Benefits, especially for represented employees. Engineers are union-represented in the South Jersey area and the representation comes with fantastic perks in comparison to the rest of the org (and the benefits for unrepresented employees is already quite good!)
-9/80 and 4/40 schedules. The greater company has just moved to a flexible 4-day work week schedule (10~ hours per day, flex hours across the 7 day week as needed), with the exception of represented employees who are allowed to stay on the flexible 9/80 schedule (9 hours Mon-Thurs, 1st week Friday 8 hours, 2nd week Friday off, flexing hours each week as needed).
-Easy transition from college. A lot is learned on the job, but you're typically paired with a buddy/mentor, and coworkers are willing to help you out.
-With the pandemic, it's hard to be social in the office and get to know people as a newcomer. Though, everyone I've encountered has been welcoming. The culture seems to be a little more lax now that so many people are WFH, so it doesn't feel very stiff for an office setting.
","-At least for my project, there's unclear division of responsibilities among management/project leadership (depending on the project). Not sure who's responsible for what, especially in this time where half the workforce is working from home. I'm always second guessing who to go to with different questions about a project. 
-Sometimes slow, sometimes busy. Been mostly slow for me so far, and it's been frustrating begging for work every week. 
-Same diversity struggles you find in most STEM positions. More often I'm on calls with more people named John or Matt present than women or POC.
-Support for new hires is inconsistent across the org. Some got a thorough on-boarding experience, some were left to try to figure it out on their own without a buddy/mentor of similar experience or without any regular one-on-ones with their manager.

* Transition(ing) to 4/10s so work life balance on work days isn't the best, but every long weekend is really nice! Though I imagine it'd be more difficult with a family. 
* Overall not a lot of stress, and you can really get out of work what you put in (whether that means you coast in your position for years or push through radical business transformations)
* Plenty of room to make improvements/drive change if you want to
","* Pay is generally below market
* You can clearly see the 80/20 principle at work in a lot of areas...
* If you're driven to make change/impact there is a lot of bureaucracy, though it's possible to cut through, it's not easy
* Depending on your overall org management generally gives a lot of lip service often without much to back it up
* The talent density on most teams is pretty sparse. There are some rock star teams and definitely some rock star people, but they're few and far between.
* Most managers aren't really technical, so they really have no idea what you're doing/how to judge your work, and as a result, how much of a merit increase you should get. Ultimately, this creates a culture (at least partially) where many people just try to seem important/busy, the old don't do anything all day, but send an email at 9pm makes it look like you're working late into the night trick.
Advice to Management
Then companies heading in the right direction but:
* You NEED more genuine technical talent in the right places. Rock stars are going to figure out they're rock stars eventually and either (rightfully) demand more pay or ultimately leave when they get a better offer. Value your talent appropriately.
* You NEED managers who can discern technical talent well, instead of solely relying off proxies like what other people say/how much they appear to be working. It's not how long someone works that really matters, it's how much they get done in that time (compared to another reasonably competent engineer). STOP hiring non-technical managers to manage a very technical team.
* I know it's easier said than done, but it would help to 1. not hire incompetent people in the first place (so make sure competent people are on interview calls), 2. fire incompetent people as it's true, a rotten apple can eventually spoil the whole bushel...especially if that rotten apple is in a high position at the tops of the bushel.
* Right now there is a culture to move to get more pay instead of staying and growing in a position. That has the cost to the team left with a (knowledge) gap they need to fill, and to the employee who needs to learn a new system/code base. Is that really the culture you want to promote, instead of one where an employee can grow on the team and become a master there with deep technical understanding?

Diverse work and project opportunities allow for you to never stagnate or be bored and to continue building skills and interact with different people and build relations. People have complained about HDDP, but I'm finding that I hit the out of pocket max after 4 months (I pay for the max plan). Good work life balance; I plan my weeks really well and focus really hard and have never had to work overtime.
","I started my job the week covid shut down my city, so I've had a hard time getting to know coworkers and have been mostly working remotely. That said, people don't seem to want to talk or share anything about themselves and it's been hard building a work community or getting to know anyone. It's a pretty lonely job overall. Thankfully, I have an amazing manager who really listens and helps me as much as he can. Salary should be more for the area. Lack of diversity among the team.

Mon Jan 11 2021, Data Analytics Manager,,Current Employee ,Great Place to Work and Getting Better Quickly,0,"I've been with LM for some years now. It's always been a great place to work - fascinating problems to work on, great sense of mission centered on national security, good pay, good benefits, and plenty of autonomy in my work. The company is getter better too, and has been at an accelerating pace over the past few years. We now work just 4 days a week for 10 hours a day, telecommuting is strongly encouraged, there's generous PTO, and the company is quickly modernizing its workflows. In a year, I might be looking to give the company 6 stars!
","The only con I can think of is a certain amount of inconsistency across the enterprise in terms of company culture. LM is a big company, and in some respects, a collection of companies. Regardless, it seems folks' experience can be heavily influenced by their team - do they have a good leader or bad, does the team work together or compete, etc. The company tries to encourage consistent good behaviors, but there is still some variation, and not all teams are as positive as mine have been.

Mon Jan 25 2021, Systems Engineer,,Current Employee ,Company has a strong value proposition but it isn't all roses and sunshine,0,"Compensation and the retirement benefits for Engineers are pretty spectacular (I am a fan of ESOP funds). The health insurance is pretty blah. I have only ever been on LM insurance and my father's (manager at a different large company) so my reference point is somewhat small but my father's insurance seemed to cover a lot more, the upside on this is LMs are pretty cheap. 
You work on cool stuff and hours are relatively flexible (This will be specific to management). LM is also very good to Engineers and I haven't known of any layoffs in my 4 years at the company. It's a very professional environment.
","You work on cool stuff but the work you contribute to that cool thing isn't always as cool or interesting as the system at large, this is particularly true for early-career employees. Getting promoted in your current group can be difficult if not altogether impossible (unless you get a competing offer and that point why stay wit the company?). For timely promotions, it is necessary to move around quite a bit. Because of those aforementioned difficulties, turnover can be high in certain salary grades (and on certain programs if the budget is tight) and I have seen many talented Engineers leave due to this slow rolling. Other than that the cons are pretty much typical of other Defense behemoths, siloing, cumbersome process, etc.
Advice to Management
Keep doing 80-90% of what you're doing. Try to set up more junior Engineers with mentors, try to keep people engaged in careers (tell them how to get promoted even if it's conceptual terms, most Engineering roles can't be fully encapsulated into command media. A manager knows what they expect from an L3 for instance and should be able to articulate that.) try to work with Engineers to help them realize long term career growth. Communicate with other Engineering groups. Be more proactive and less reactive. Engineers and managers both know the either isn't perfect but there's still room for reasonable improvement.

","PRE COVID
Worked for 6 months as a sub-contractor in a newly created administrative role support senior software engineering project engineers. Overall day to day is similar to working in a warehouse with some thrown together conference spaces (usually lacking equipment or overly disorderly). Company primarily hires subcontractors for deliverables and direct hires for management so working with a variety of stakeholders. Company events and activities are open to all, but services like the gym and the health center are reserved for direct hires as well. I went to the health center once for a band aid and was turned away because I was not a direct hire.
Requested monthly meetings to discuss workload balance; discussions mostly focused around work prioritization and not having enough work to do. No change/progress/actions positively recorded from these meetings. Another program, while I was lacking in work, requested I present and then train their teammate on the metrics that I generated. The request denied by my supervisors as I had, paraphrasing, “too much work to do” and that that specific program was not paying my salary.

COVID
When covid first appeared in the space it was kept very quiet, you only knew about the cases in your program, despite everyone mingling in common areas like hallways, bathrooms and the kitchen. I was surprised and disappointed to the see the very minimal communication and safety precautions enacted as covid cases kept appearing. Hearing stories of people coming to work with a fever for a few days. Other co-workers having to take desensitization showers everyday upon coming home so they do not risk their immunocompromised family members. I was only provided a temporary medical mask one day when I hunted one down myself. My subcontracting company provided hand sanitizer and cleaning products to myself and other subcontractors, which my desk mates would borrow. Regular mask wearing inside conference spaces was not enforced going into April.

Without going into my personal medical history, I was unable to continue my work in office and a month later my “termination was accepted” (did I really have a choice?). At the end my employment, my workload included tasks I could only do in the office and I was uncomfortable returning to the workplace with so few health and safety regulations in place.

Tue Dec 29 2020, Software Engineer,"Herndon, VA",Current Employee ,Entrenched Interests of a Bureaucratic Hierarchy,0,"This is a great company to start out. To learn and to get your hands dirty with real meaningful System Integration and Technology experience. If you're one of the lucky few who's able to work with R&D, you can really learn a lot.
","After a few years at the company, you'll be starved to learn more and take the reins more often. However, the company's size and processes through either it's own private affairs or government interests will make this a difficult ask. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's important to remember that entrenched interests shy away from risk and bureaucratic hierarchies often lead to unnecessary waste and mis-management. In the most dysfunctional corporations, signaling that work is being done often becomes a more effective mechanism for career development than actually doing work. If these traits are not ones you're looking for, then I wouldn't advise applying.

(Its important to note that there are a few departments that are trying to undo this culture, but the effects aren't widespread or noticeable yet.)
Advice to Management
Let your employees work freely. There is this hierarchical structure that exists at the company that often views employees in a specific department as ""having dibs"" on their productivity. If you facilitate employees moving in and out of different departments and different business areas, you'll find the talent that you truly need and reduce the waste that is involved in retaining talent that has nothing to do with what your department works on.

Advice to Management
If you check multiple diversity and inclusion boxes you will rise the ranks quickly. Those who don't check enough boxes are bullied into becoming ""allies"". Diversity is used over merit to justify staffing and career advancement.

Company Actions need to be realigned to Company Values. My experience showed me that the company will reinterpret ethics and corporate values to fit the company's immediate need even if they contradict themselves the next day.

This used to be a fantastic company until corporate seemingly bought into this woke stuff.

","Every aspect of corporate life that exists, exists at Lockheed. As an employee, you’re inundated with rules and red tape, political bs, and Lockheed demands and expects employees to go above and beyond yet Lockheed won’t do the same for you. It’s a great place to work for the ambitious corporate sheep. For the free thinker, the value adder, the person that asks “why?”, this is not the place for you. Common sense and logic fail here. Instead, inundation via non-value added process and meetings rules all. Lockheed does a great job obtaining nee talent, yet does a terrible job at retaining that talent. 

This was authored by a high performing “Significantly Exceeds” employee, suffering through the epitome of what is corporate life.

LM is very flexible and people focused. 
You get out what you put in--if you want to excel and grow, you always have the room to do that. There are so many opportunities and different growth paths. Truly something for everyone.
","YMMV on flexibility as it will depend heavily on your direct line leadership and specific program culture. However, general LM policies give a lot of great options for employees. 
Culture around the company can vary significantly from program to program. This includes everything from growth opportunities to recognition and work life balance to team interactions. 
Funding is very rigid and implementation of new innovations / technologies is typically slow (similar to healthcare, often there are many regulations to keep in compliance due to risk of life and risk of security breaches). 
If you aren't driving your growth, it isn't likely to happen in most areas. There is no common set up path for training and growth. You have to be proactive here; when you are, there are numerous resources and people that are more than happy to help you once you ask.

Advice to Management
Management needs to do a better job of stopping micromanaging their employees when working a contract. Program management and chief engineers need to stop under bidding contracts, because it's unnatural to code for 9 hours a day without getting up for a single break (any time away is not able to be billed to the contract). The promotion process is incredibly opaque, and has a ton of arbitrary time worked at LMCO/# degrees earned rules, and it makes it easy for there to be unequal pay across different races/genders/etc. HR is basically inaccessible in the engineers org, as there is one HR business partner for around 500 engineers. Allocate time for employees to engage within the site and community instead of making it all on their own time. Invest in the work space too. A dark dingy space filled with mice and cockroaches with employees who don't have the luxury to engage in a team lunch, or holiday party make for unhappy opportunities. Also, employees shouldn't feel guilty about using sick time.

","This company is way too big for its own self to be organize. There’s absolutely no training and/or minimal training given. Nobody keeps procedures and only the successful ones are the ones that have been there for decades. It’s very tough for new employees and graduates to the company because you have to learn things on your own and basically figure it out. You have to fail here in order to be shown how to do things or receive training. This is the most frustrating part because you will have a hard time to grow and learning new things. It’s very disorganized here and unless you know people to go to then you will sink. If you are new and require training then this company is not the right fit for you. Go with a company that’s more structured and actually provide formal training. Otherwise, you’d regret being here and feel frustrated when you shouldn’t be at a job. Makes it very hard to get up in the morning to come to work because it’s like what do I have to teach myself or figure out now. There’s been a lot of people leaving for this.
Advice to Management
Listen to the newer employees and those who are struggling to provide hands on training instead of just making us watch videos. Have some structure in place so anyone new to the company wouldn’t feel so lost and know how to catch up to the rest. Don’t expect or assume newer people are at the same level or expect them to know when you don’t provide adequate training. If they are confused or struggle to answer answers and/or produce then ask yourself if you provided them with the formal training and education before coming down hard on them or have a pro conceive notion that they are not catching on.

Some programs offer flex hour options for work weeks (4x10's, 9x80s, etc). Stable and reliable paycheck. Great health incentives (and you'll need them!), HSA and company contributions. Great mission and you really feel like you're a part of something bigger and important.
","Men get paid and promoted more than women. If you are a woman, I recommend looking elsewhere, period. Engineers are valued above all else.

Absolutely no work/life balance. Pace is unreal. Not enough people to perform the work and as a result so much turnover. You are expected to work overtime, it's an unsaid rule, but definitely expected that you work at a minimum of 45 hours per week. They claim work/life balance, because they give you the option to work on the weekends ... beware - overtime is part of the culture.

Antiquated culture. Much of the workforce is close to retirement and stuck in the way we've always done things, many lacking technological skills/training, still printing tons of paper, and grumpy. Growth opportunities are limited and middle management is not supportive of advancement and mentoring. Skills are not matched and potential not realized for a lot of the employees. Expected to do stretch assignments to get bonuses, but not given time to perform these assignments/ opportunities. 

So many young people leave for higher paying jobs. Lack of general administrative processes and emphasis on process improvement. They encourage you to speak up for change, but nothing changes.
Advice to Management
Use more resources to place people in the right positions. Promote high performers so they don't leave. Increase wages in high cost of living areas. If you advertise work/life balance - take steps to ensure management is sending that message to the workforce. Change the culture to a more modern and forward thinking. Don't just have diversity events - prove you are a diverse workplace by hiring a more diverse staff. Value administrative functions as much as engineers.

Poor culture, poor benefits, work life balance sucks, pay is just okay. I have worked as a represented employee for the union and I have lead represented employees as a Supervisor on the company side. You would think Sr. management is out of touch with their workforce, turns out MOST of them just don’t care, not saying there aren’t good ones. In the production world it is a real “us vs them” mentality, actually had a Sr. Manager refer to my hourly employees as prisoners on more than one occasion. Benefits continually get worse year over year for the salaried crowd who have no right to a CBA or any type of negotiating power and corporate hacks claim “this is to be competitive within the industry”. Too much negative to fit in this review. I have busted it for 4 promotions in a 5 year span. Unfortunately I don’t think I will be making a lifetime career at Lockheed Martin, this place is a drain on your soul.

","I worked in several different groups in both Sunnyvale and Palo Alto and the toxic good old boys culture is pervasive. If you call out anyone who has been at the company longer than you no matter how racist, sexist, or abusive, you will be blamed and managed out your group. HR and Ethics will do nothing. I reported someone and then a year later i got contacted for investigation because someone else had reported the same person I did. I also had 2 situations where I was the lead engineer but then replaced once the project reached viability with the EVP. One of the white men who replaced me had less knowledge of how to work on things and was a terrible leader but they didn't stop him from moving up the good ole boys ladder onto my role and later onto a further L code promotion once someone else moved up. 

There is also a culture of favoritism. All the future managers/leaders have already been preselected by management and it is impossible to move up unless you are one of these people. Even if you provide exceptional work.

The benefits are constantly diminished but yet spinned as they are being improved. I was constantly paid less than my peers despite having responsibilities sometimes above those paid more than me.

If you are smart and young go someone else unless you enjoy using your white privilege as a super power.

Stop protecting abusive managers and technical leaders. Just because they have a more significant role in the project doesn't mean they are excusable.

","From the first day I started working here I noticed that not a single person in my group introduced themselves, and still hadn't even after my first month. Anyone I passed in the hallway wouldn't even look up from their shoes to smile or say hi. This site is filled with anti-social personalities and you can feel suffocated by the environment. You're expected to know everything about what's happening in your position and all the technicalities of your role from the minute you start with little to no training outside of the blah blah company ethics, values, and why you should love the CEO. The culture in this facility needs a major overhaul and until that happens there will continue to be low employee retention rates, especially among new hires.
Advice to Management
Invest in company culture. Simply posting ""cool"" things that are happening (somewhere) within the company online may be enough to get good people in the door but certainly not enough to retain them. Invest in your facilities. Promote employee collaboration. DON'T hire based on GPA, education, and experience alone, look at the whole person. Will they get along with others, do they have a good personality, can they communicate effectively with their peers, are they someone you would WANT to work with.

","Pay is horrible. Especially when you compare it to pay-scales, for the same job and company, from 10 - 30 years ago. While doing better financially than they ever have, they are still paying lower rates than they ever have. 

They use a fake Union to justify paying people $10-$11/hour to build the most advanced, and most expensive, systems in the world. 

If you mention that the pay is a few dollars an hour shy of a basic living, they just suggest working overtime, or remind you that, ""We do this for the warfighters!"" Even when you are/were the ""warfighter.""

Advancement opportunities are purely turn based. No merit based anything.

The rate of raises doesn't even keep up with the rate of inflation. So, the longer you stay, the worse your financial situation becomes.

You will most likely qualify for welfare

They care more about paying low wages then they care about building quality products.

Constantly having to fix recirculating systems due to assembly issues.

Your recognition for improving a process and/or saving the company money is a shoutout in the middle of a meeting. Which would be fine, except while you get a pat on the back your supervisor gets a big fat bonus for what you did.
Advice to Management
Hire more qualified people, at reasonable pay, and your defects/red tags will decrease while your productivity will increase. Get rid of your fake union and stop being so deceitful to your employees.

- 9x80 schedule for most (every other Friday off)
- Exciting opportunities that are hard to find elsewhere
- Employees who love doing what they do
","- Salary is not even close to competitive in the Denver area. They offer roughly 30-40k less than most companies. 
- Years with the company is a limiting factor on promotions. If you are performing above your position but have less years experience than expected, managers are unable to give you promotions. 
- High turnaround with new hires
- Not a very diverse workplace, the majority of employees are middle aged white men
- mMuch of the technology used is very old legacy technology. While you may create state of the art products, you will use old technology to do so
Advice to Management
If you want to solve the high turn around issues with the younger employees, you need to actually offer competitive pay. After 3 years with the company, I still make less than multiple colleagues who just graduated. 

You also need to readdress your promotion requirements. I’ve known multiple colleagues at the company (including myself) who have left because they were doing a job of a more senior level position but could not be promoted because of their years of experience. 

Bottom line: the people I worked with and the teams I was on made me feel very appreciated and respected. They admired the work I did and offered me leadership roles within those teams. Lockheed as a company did not make me feel appreciated. My manager couldn’t promote me because of your policies, he couldn’t give me the highest level performance review because of your policies, and you lost a good engineer because of your policies.

Thu Jun 11 2020, Senior Software Engineer,"Colorado Springs, CO",Former Employee ,Overall a Good Company,0,"-Lots of good people there, I enjoyed working with my colleagues.
-Flexible work life balance.
-Lockheed will pay for your post graduate schooling.
-80 hours of Floating Holidays
-Strong Ethics and Values
-Good opportunities to mentor and learn
-Some cool R&D projects
","-Colorado Springs location used to have a cafeteria. They replaced it with a gas station like food.
-There used to be more work at this area, but other contractors have beat Lockheed in some contracts Colorado Springs. With more space work coming to Colorado Springs, I'm sure they will have more opportunities.
-Security - This is happening with all defense contractors, but over the last 3 years or so, Lockheed starting locking down on some processes and labs adding more work on teams to comply with stricter security measures. I found I was spending much more time with security people in meetings instead of working on building the product.
-Paternity leave is not as good as some other defense contractors.
-Lockheed recently combined PTO and sick time. They added 40 hours of ""discretionary"" time as well, but it was a little confusing when you can or can't use it. I think they should just let you use discretionary time for whatever you want.

-Typical Bureaucracy Complaint: 
Working in different business areas feels like working for a different company. A while ago Lockheed used to be more unified as a company, but it becomes confusing who is responsible for what IT infrastructure, security, etc. when you have different business units in the same building. For example, if you work for RMS in a Space building, you might have two different security groups evaluating and randomly making requests for you to comply with security. Sometimes they even contradict each other, and don't communicate. You'll get an email from someone on the east coast demanding you make changes to your local system or a server they scanned. You then hop on a call with (I'm not even exaggerating) 20 different people who don't know each other trying to coordinate and figure out who is responsible for patching and fixing the system in question. It gets figured out eventually, the only point I'm making is it's a lot of man power to address sometimes lower priority items.
Advice to Management
Please make an effort to organize security and IT more efficiently. Having local IT and security people seemed to be more efficient. Getting random security requests from people not involved with the project, and asking the project to drop everything and fix these issues on the project's dime is unreasonable. Instead of working against projects, find ways to work with them in this area.

","This has been one of the most uninspiring work experiences I have ever had. 
Onboarding is horrible, you will feel lost for months at a time almost guaranteed.
Management is not very people oriented, most are senior engineers who happened to stay at the company a while but have little experience in modern management practices. Poor communication from middle management. 
There are are close to zero work from home opportunities for those who do 'cleared' work. 
Facilities, building, bathrooms, cafeteria are all very outdated and are very reminiscent of the inner city schools I went to two decades ago. 
Windows are not allowed by design in the office spaces and cell phones and most electronics are banned.
Time tracking means you are responsible for being accountable for every minute you are in the office. Think of this as built in micromanagement and constant threats of time theft. Think of the exact opposite of Google or Facebook.
There is no system or culture of mentorship or on the job learning. Many more experienced engineers do not want to take the time to help you out or share their knowledge. Some prefer to keep precious expertise to themselves by design. 
Any 'extracurricular' learning you may want to do or is offered at work will be required to be made up in time after hours or on the weekends - minute for minute.
Days can be long, slow, and teamwork close to nil. I sometimes go several days at a time without speaking to anyone physically and I am VERY social normally. 
You can spend months at a time waiting for processes or technical help. You will feel your soul draining and life leave your soul trying to get a meaningful day of work done as a regular engineer. We are really just cogs in the machine and are treated as such.
If you come from a background of military or police worship and keep Trump sticks on your car, you will probably fair better here.
Advice to Management
Provide means of anonymous survey feedback to upper management. I know many people feel the same way as me. Invest in training for middle management to learn modern leadership practices. Do not ask engineers to work after hours in order to make up several days of time because the building went out of power mid day. Provide more than well wishes and thank you letters in emails for people who have been unable to work a single day from home during the covid19 pandemic. Create a means by which employees may give feedback to middle managers.

-I do like the fact that I broke 6 figures after working here for just two years. I like my pay a lot.
-People here are easy to work and collaborate with (besides a smart aleck or two, but that's everywhere you work at).
-My team's environment is very lax. Hardly anyone gets upset at anyone.
-We get decent health benefits and a pretty snazzy 401k contribution. They have a percentage based contribution added on top of the blanket contribution that they give you, so it gives you a nice overall total.
-They accommodated for the time that I had to use bereavement leave twice, so they definitely do care about work/life balance (unless if you have a pager). 
-They do reimbursements for Master's Degrees (variable amount depending on subject of interest for up to 3 years).
","-Sometimes there's not much to do, then there's a lot to do or vice versa. Basically pacing could use some improvement. This problem existed before the Covid-19 epidemic and will likely exist as long as Lockheed Martin exists as a company.
-The heads of corporate do feel like a separate entity from us, so there are instances where HQ's words from Colorado feel a bit hollow.
-Moving up the corporate ladder feels really hard to do unless if you have at least a Master's Degree. If you only have a Bachelor's Degree, you'll likely stay at the same position for your career.
-Growth doesn't feel like a priority at here. My conversations with several employees indicate that they were satisfied at staying at their current employment despite there not being much growth. There is an ELDP program and they do have partnerships with some colleges, but my co-workers indicated that these programs aren't as useful as using the reimbursement program to fund your own Master's Degree studies.

I know what I am saying. 

There will be no supervisor available even in 4 months. Like Sam E. lives in Puerto Rico so he can't help. Sean D. and Sue G. lives at Florida so they can't help much either. Client (users) will behave badly with you, SPOC (Ivan, Jason) will not behave well or professionally with you either. Even RDS won't be cordial with you. This place/job is like disgusting. As I said, even cleaning trash can & won't be that bad, compare to this job. At the training time, they will behave with you like they are handing you over the best job you can ever have. As soon as the training is finished, you will see the real picture gradually. Even if the training were any good, you would not had to struggle that much as you will gonna, since right from the start. 

Do not get fool by the name of the company which is ""Lockheed Martin"". That's what happens with everybody pretty much. This is the most neglected position of this company. This job has lots of problem, unlike other jobs. You may say, all the jobs have problems.. True but that does not apply to this one. This one is specially gross. You are on your own pretty much all the time. You won't see the supervisor, even months after months goes by. Only way to contact them is phone or chat. Which they won't even answer on time. If you have done Customer Service Representative jobs before then you may try here, otherwise stay away, at all cost. Basically people are back stabber here, for their own good. That's the culture of this company or at least in this location.

","This what I saw on the 2 legacies programs and a new one I worked on.
Bad functional managers, toxic work culture set by older management riding the clock for the last 15 years.
The environment is stuck back 20 years is really a sustainment place, silo programs , very compartmentalize and very few new programs and the new programs the main positions are given to internal people (favoritism) that don’t have the experience/skill set for such tasks which basically creates reaction management NO planning is bad (like me mentor used to say the blind leading the blind), never seen so much incompetence.
 Sustainment programs are set by tribal knowledge which are just people hoarding information and they keep riding the clock. 
There’s not much HW design that I saw they are an Integrator so the suppliers deliver the electronic boxes main things are cables, break out boxes basically what my technicians or interns in other companies do. There’s few Basic CCA designs and those jobs are given to the favorites.
I like the people and the company however me and other people that came from other companies with lots of direct experience realize is a bad place since we won’t learn as much, will be pigeon hole , the culture and frustration from inept technical leads ( not all but most) drove us away. I just waited over a year to move on back to my previous company the short time I was there never really saw people smile or crack a joke which told me a lot.

","Lockheed has a culture that believes they only need to compete with other defense contractors as employers. As such, when other defense contractors lower their standards for how they treat their employees, Lockheed will follow suit, including with benefits. Pay is only okay and healthcare is only getting worse. This is terrible for morale and does not keep people at the job. 
Lockheed will communicate when their groups are not able to promote from within, which is good. However, having to actively look for a job for a promotion is awkward. 

Also, depending on the work you do, it can get easy and monotonous. This makes it easy to become complacent and potentially be unmarketable. 

Depending on your work, your manager will be physically distant, and therefore hard to form a relationship. 

Lastly, in a time of crisis, Lockheed treated the outbreak as business as usual with a little hand sanitizer sprinkled in the factory. The factory was pretty much full capacity with no social distancing. People were still crowding in golf carts. Cafeteria was operating at full capacity with no social distancing. Plenty of people operating without masks. It wasn’t until a month of social distancing that Lockheed decided to order masks for those who cannot practice social distancing due to the nature of their job. This does not make people feel safe at their workplace nor valued.
Advice to Management
Take care of your employees. The better you treat them, the better the benefits, the better the pay, the more people want to stay. 
Also, keep your tech stack up with moving technology. Pure java apps are not sustainable for employees’ futures.
Work on mentorship programs and development programs. Invest in employees. 
Put action behind words and policies. Culture of accountability felt like all talk for employees and none for management.

Management

Only worked here a couple of years before I was ready to find something else. Just did not care for the management structure. At the executive level they talk about the need for lower turnover. But in reality at the working level the project engineers who run the programs don’t care about employee turnover they only care about schedule and budget because that’s how they are graded and how they have the programs set up to be run. 

They claim they don’t have very much turnover but if you go to the California employment website and search through warn notices by employer and by year you can see they have layoffs almost every year. Depending on which political party has power in Washington defense spending can be cut and you have even less security. They are less than frank about this part of the business.

It’s difficult to gain meaningful experience when many of the projects are not real world and limited opportunity to develop new skills. There are new projects created to explore new manufacturing methods to gain experience but in reality not a lot of meaningful experience comes out of them. Having worked at other companies many of their processes are outdated and need to be updated and improved. However they typically dont listen to those ideas even though other companies have years of experience doing what they are trying to do successfully.

There’s a complete disconnect from the work most engineers have and what the executives who run the company believe there is a need for. I’ve listened to executives talk about having hundreds of open positions needing to be filled when I knew dozens and dozens of engineers who have little if any actual work to do and are hopeful that a new program gets funded. It’s a very awkward and uncomfortable position to be in. 

Managers who are responsible for finding assignments for their employees have almost no power to do that. It is determined by project engineers who play office politics heavily. In addition widespread age or wage discrimination. Project managers want to pick up college hires because they make less even though the quality of the work suffers.

Problem here lies with the management structure. Programs are managed by project engineers who are only concerned with schedule and budget. If they could outsource the entire project to engineers in India and come in under budget and on schedule they would.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the project engineering management style. You need programs run by managers who are vested in their employees and are accountable for turnover. There’s no incentive for project engineers to treat employees well because they are not responsible for turnover or performance reviews as project engineers are only graded by schedule and budget. If half the team decides to leave as long as it’s under budget and on time it doesn’t matter to anyone but the skill captains managers who have to replace them.

Fri Feb 28 2020,N/A,, ,Disingenuous,2,"Complete lack of accountability or responsibility....you get to go to a PMT meeting every two weeks to play games similar to when you were in 2nd grade.
","Today we reported outstanding financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the close of an exceptional year at Lockheed Martin.
 
In 2019, you produced extraordinary financial, operational, and strategic results. These results are a tribute to your unwavering focus on our customers and your consistent performance in an increasingly complex and competitive business environment. Lockheed Martin’s net sales increase of 11 percent over last year, we achieved our highest annual sales in our company’s history. This marked the fifth year in a row we ended with a record backlog.”
 
But instead of this “record breaking” year financially translating into meaningful raises and bonuses for the little people that make all this actually possible, we are seeing LESS in raises and bonuses than last year! All of the trite saying and platitudes are being traipsed out to explain this…what happened to we are going to flip the pyramid??
 
This is why crack pot’s like Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren are actually making progress in our political system!! The “Have’s” keep having more and those that do the work get crumbs. I predict that with this leadership failure there will be some consequences. It will show itself during the next union negotiations that are coming up and it will also show in increasing dissatisfaction of our younger employees which will leave to find greener pastures. With the number of employees at the retirement threshold growing this will mean disaster for Lockheed. Lockheed talks…just talks about Knowledge Transfer from these super experienced people to the new generation. This is just that…talk…there is no incentive for people with all of this experience to give it for free to the new generation!! 
 
It is a no brainer that crack pots like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are seen by our youth as a viable choice for leading our country…they see the huge gap between the have’s and the have nots and they believe this to be social injustice. America of yesteryear has been destroyed…thinking that all you have to do is work hard and you can succeed is a platitude still trotted out by the have’s….it is a huge LIE!! Basically the harder you work and the more you care…the harder you work and the more you care while getting nothing but maybe a pat on the back for all of your efforts. Lockheed is a bloated stinky dying dinosaur and as time passes they are headed for the same type of fall as other huge corporations have had in our history. Without “Flipping this Pyramid” and placing value where the value needs to be placed this house of cards will inevitably collapse from the greed and lies.
 
I believe Kelly Johnson’s historic temper would be incurred by those at the top of Lockheed today because they are squandering the most precious of assets…PEOPLE!

Program management has been very successful in recent years in bringing in new business that opens up opportunities for employees to continue working on projects within their comfort zone, or expand their knowledge by taking on projects that require learning new technologies.

No micromanagement. You're given a task, allowed to provide input for scheduling deliverables and expected to meet your commitments, or step up and report reasons for possible delays as soon as they become apparent.

","It's always seemed like a rat race that's induced by the company culture. There's very few opportunities to ""move up"" when you're mid-career. Benefits are terrible, and Salary was never positive. I earned less each year because of the minimal salary increases, and increase in benefits costs. When programs get lean, management has typically asked employees to contribute at least 10 hrs of overtime uncompensated prior to consideration for overtime. When annual compensation raises were around the corner, having contributed 10 hrs of uncompensated overtime was the status quo, and even then you may see a 1.8% increase on an under market salary.

Upper management seemed to be heavily pepperd with cronyism... I've never seen such flagrant application of it. There was a wall of management at every step of the way.

I was always in fear of my position being eliminated. Management would say ""last one in, first one out"" regardless of experience that I brought to the team.
