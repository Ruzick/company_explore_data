Advice to Management
Like any company of this size, the higher up the management chain you go, the more detached they are from the reality of day-to-day challenges. This means that as an employee your communication skills must be precise and efficient to reach higher management with concerns/ideas. This is to be expected with a company of this size, and communication and ""self-sales"" is a necessary skill that I have learned/honed working here.

Technology needs to slow down. When you roll out new initiatives (like P2P), you need to truly pause and reprioritize meaningfully rather than play lip service to weekends. Senior leaders need to dig deep behind the reporting and challenge their directs on priorities on what really needs to be done now to move 80/20 levers instead of saying yes to everything.

It's a 37.5-hour work week, and there are early Fridays.

Fannie Mae is big into work-life balance, as well as providing volunteer opportunities.
","It's really slow getting any work done because of so many layers of approval. To sign something off, you may need up to fifty different eyes on it, plus government approval. Most projects take years to get done because of the levels of vetting and authorization. 

There's not always enough work to do, so several people coast in their roles. Most managers don't mind this, but for people that want to come to work to do work, this could be frustrating. 

Your experience at Fannie Mae can be totally different depending on the manager that you have. Some managers are great and promote great team morale, while others do not. So your experience really depends on which team, which director, and which vice president you have.

Death by meetings. So. many. meetings. And most of them unecessary.

","- TONS of bad managers, office politics, and corporate bureaucracy to work with
- work two weekends each month during month end and quarter close

- a lot of meaningless meetings and boring work, you copy/pasting excel, check excel formulas to make sure the data output is correct, have a TONS of meeting, making sure the input data was correct

- their SOPs are outdated, so you have to learn the process on your own and as you work. You can ask your friendly colleague (most of them are nice, only some are knowledgeable) if you have questions but manager will think you cannot perform your work

-my manager was borderline abusive. Calling and emailing you at 10pm and weekends. Force people to weekly training meeting with no end goal. No people skills. If you ask them too many questions, they will start judging your ability to perform your work

- their database legacy system are... legacy / outdated, makes it difficult to obtain data. You have to ask another team to get the data for you, which mean others will do the same thing. It makes the work frustrating since half of your time is waiting for data and it might be wrong

- they just change their corporate structure to make it harder for people to advance / get promotion. There are a lot more layers, more entry, middle, and manager titles before you will ever get promoted. for current employee, it's like everyone got demoted

- rotation program is selective and based on favorites, you have to go behind your manager to apply for other jobs within the firm
- promotion is based on position availability and favorites. 

- No bonus structure for employee (even thou they say they have one), management will always get their bonus

- you have a bi-weekly meeting w/ your manager and a monthly one with your director. Then you have a daily huddle 15 min meeting (if you are lucky, or it usually go over). On top of those, you might have one or two meetings every other day
- tons of employee surveys to fill out, management does not take them seriously unless it's favorable critique 
- Trying to come out of conservatorship means they careless about employee well-being, benefits, and no budget for team social events (all grouped into a corp event)
- commuting to DC
Advice to Management
- Fix the bureaucracy and the toxic / abusive managers, it really kills the joy of coming to work. 
- Some of the WoW practices are pointless if you only listen to the favorable critique. Same for employee survey. 
- Flatten out your corp structure, it doesn't help with retention
- Cut down on pointless meetingsss
- Upgrade your database or internal system to be more user-friendly, you are wasting a lot of time/resource putting on band-aids instead of fixing the problem. It kills efficiency

","I started many years ago and Fannie was a great place to work. I loved my job, pay was great and all FTE's received a bonus. The past 2 years, upper management has made it very clear that they will continue to get a large bonus, while the working class get little to nothing. If you are not a manager or above, a bonus is a thing of the past

They are hiring contractors by the truckload as many people are leaving to go to different companies. The brain drain is due to all the items above I noted. Do not expect to get a bonus if you are just a normal FTE. Upper management had protected their bonus structure and for anyone they are protecting. Everyone else will lose thousands. 

Upper management like to push their product and leave the products that are actually customer with no updates or budget to complete improvements. They only way you will move up in the company is being a yes man to anyone above you. UM states they want to hear different ideas, but if you are not towing the line for their pet project, forget it. 

Fannie wants to be the google of the mortgage industry. Google pays well, Fannie does not anymore. Thankfully, I will be leaving soon, like so many others.
Advice to Management
You are taking away thousands of dollars from your employees that was part of their comp package for years and are not replacing it with anything. The old guard is still in charge and will continue to make huge mistakes. This will cause Fannie to lose excellent employees.

Too much control on technology and software in the name of security, which itself becomes a hindrance to progress. Decision makers at the senior levels sometimes purely get there due to seniority and may not make decisions that are always best for the organization/team from a long term perspective. Performance evaluation cycles are a sham and all attempts to make it better fundamentally have only resulted in changes to the software/user experience related to the self-assessment write up, which probably accounts for nothing significant at the end of the day.

","Job titles and pay grades are confusing and sometimes inappropriate based on the role. Varying levels of experience amongst managers with different standards of performance expectations (some are harsher or more perfectionistic while some are more lenient or more realistic) and sometimes unclear, shared, or split responsibility for employees which is a common management mistake. Work/life balance varies across different teams as some teams offer less flexibility than others. Visible difference between treatment of FTEs and contractors. Common theme amongst numerous contractors that they wouldn't want to work at the company full-time.
Advice to Management
Management needs further training on how to effectively evaluate performance, coach and develop employees. Perfectionistic managers may stunt career growth and development of employees and inaccurately assess consistency of performance based on proven track record of delivering upon goals. These types of managers do very little to support the professional growth and development of employees and do not have supportive relationships with their directs but rather treat their professional relationships as business transactions instead of a human connection. At the relationship level, harsher managers may sometimes do more damage than good in order to meet overly aggressive business goals. 

More lenient managers tend to have better relationships and tend to be more realistic about an employee's strengths and weaknesses and are better at identifying a good fit for their skillset. At the same time, these types of managers may not enforce the same high standard for performance expectations. 

Management should work to strike a balance for this.

","- Highly regulated company. To get a salary increase you have to go through FHFA. Managers do not feel like going through that hassle
- Salaries are subpar for Washington, DC (prepare to have a roommate)
- Bonuses are miserable.
- Directors and VP’s get special treatment. They break all the rules and nothing happens
- Some VP’s abuse benefits. They will spend over $100k traveling and staying at hotels so that they can live the good life at a cheaper city while hard workers have to find ways to afford living in DC
- Performance Management tool is a joke. Everybody knows it, everybody complains about it and nothing is done to change it. Managers will sacrifice new employees to give more senior employees a better rating since a bell curve needs to be satisfied. So, you will not get the subpar 3% they “guarantee” even if you meet expectations. Same goes for the “bonus”
- I moved offices 3 times in under a year. Signed a year lease and was never told we would be moving prior. I found during orientation
- Management thought it would be fair to just give a $1,200 yearly raise to offset moving the office to midtown. That is not enough to cover gas and parking. Most people will need to spend an extra 30 minutes commuting and pay more in rent to live closer. 
- People are rude in the company as most people in DC
- VIP parking (within the same building) was assigned via a “lottery”. Two drawings and “surprisingly” all managers and above got a spot
- Serious ethical issues such as directors wanting others to fail to look good or just say “I told you so”
- Constant power struggle amongst management
- No one works on Fridays; they just keep Jabber active and pretend to be working
- No assigned offices. There is a 40% deficit in available seats in the new building. Let’s see how that works out on Mondays through Thursdays
- Life balance is non-existent. Managers will make you work on weekends and holidays. They will not explicitly tell you, but give you deadlines that leaves that as the last resort

","Company is a joke! CEO has no clue what is going on in this organization. Management favors H1B visa people. If you're hired as a full time. Please be ready to get laid off within 6 months which is their trial period. Full time employees will get replaced by H1B visa folks. You will be given thousands different direction and expected to listen to everyone. Leads are basically managers too. So do not expect leads to help you if you're new. You will be directed through lead, manager, and director. Directors and managers will back folks who have been there for really long time. You will be disrespected by other FTE in your department. This organization is completely dishonest with you from the day you're hired until you're laid off or fired. HR department is another joke. Call them and you will get someone who's barely passed high school and their attitude will be touching the sky. They say people who leave these kind of comments weren't doing their job. The truth is this organization will treat you like slave and you will be working 24/7.

Tue Nov 07 2017, Director,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,Human Capital Planning - who can we lay off?,6,"Benefits, compensation, work life balance
","Continually changing priorities and approaches has the firm in a constant state of flux. Much is said about a human capital plan, which may sound impressive but is essentailly a constant re-evaluation of who could be expendable. Another buzz phrase is shape shifting, which boils down to replacing more senior middle management with lower cost staff. The CIO actually stated that employees should consider a 18 month tenure a good run in the ""current environment"". Below the officer (VP) level the constant churn is discomforting. At the VP level and above the brain drain is on. If stability is important this isn't the place for you.

After 9 years of conservetorship parallel business plans are about to collide. The Obama administration planned on winding Fannie down with a plan of bringing the capital position to zero by Jan. 2018. Not only is Fannie still in place, it's delivering billions of dollars to Treasure each year. Those dollars are generated from gaurantee fees collected on qualifying mortgages to cover losses related to loan defaults: essentially insurance. But all of the money collected in fees is transferred quarterly to the US Treasury, so there'll no capital to cover related losses. As a result, Fannie Mae would need to draw from Treasury to cover quarterly losses. This is exacerbated by a lower than 35% Corporate Tax rate. Fannie Mae is still writing off losses, but the writeoffs assumed a 35% tax rate. A rate any lower decreases the value of the write-offs, which increases Fannie's tax liability. With no capital in 2018 there's no money to pay higher taxes.
Advice to Management
The aspirations or human capital planning are commendable. But the current plan coupled with the annual employee survey runs counter to what employees see happening.

Tue Nov 28 2017, Product Designer,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,Not for everyone,11,"Compensation and certain team members.
","Mortgage industry subject-matter expertise is respected more than domain or discipline expertise. The organization has too many lifers who are unwilling to adapt or change. It takes forever to get critical software approved and you are expected to be grateful for what they can provide for you. You have limited resources as a designer to do your best work, especially when you are being asked to compromise research for the sake of shipping products.

Half of the company doesn't even know Fannie Mae has an internal design team, which results in duplicative projects all over the organization that may not even address the real needs of customers. Research is not respected and insights are too biased to be useful. They have product owners who used to be business analysts and they have no idea what they are doing. There are too many cooks in the kitchen on projects and designers have the last seat at the table, if at all. The organization has huge silos within silos and no one communicates. It is VERY hierarchical and executives are more like dictators. They expect designers to be magicians who will help the organization become more customer-centered, but they are unwilling to set them up for success. 

The issues within the organization are systemic and deeply ingrained in the culture, and it will take a LONG time to establish the conditions necessary for the culture to shift. Some of the senior leaders are incredibly arrogant, direct and impersonal, and the culture can feel very bureaucratic, regimented, and lacklustre at times.
Advice to Management
Hire leaders who have a track record of growing design teams with mutual respect, empathy and vision. Get rid of egomaniacs, empire-builders and status-quo lifers on the management team - it's toxic for everyone.

SLOW DOWN and focus on building out the foundation of a team before you get carried away with the size of your team or the number of projects. Treat employees with respect and value quality over quantity. Don't embellish your successes. Be real and honest with the team about the challenges ahead, and provide a clear mission and vision for what you're all working toward, why and how.

Sat May 20 2017, Not Specified,"Dallas, TX",Former Employee ,Great Place to Work and Advance Your Career,1,"I was at Fannie Mae for about 2 years but worked with the company before I was an actual employee. It is a great place to work. They care about their employees and actually desire to further your career. They offer multiple training opportunities, offer assistance to further your education, and offer feedback to help you in your career journey. In all of my previous jobs I had never seen such a pro-employee environment. Not to say that I wasn't frustrated at times with management - I was. But to me the benefits of working for Fannie outweighed this. I ended up relocating and leaving the company. But had I stayed in the area, I would have considered Fannie Mae to be my forever home. If you have a chance to work there, you will not be disappointed.
","Because people tend to not leave the company (because its a great place to work) I did see quite a few people in management in which mediocre performance was tolerated. And because they wont leave on their own, they end up at the company for a long time. Cant get them out, so they are promoted up to make them someone else's problem. There were times I felt that I could have done my manager's job better than they did. But I also felt management was overworked so that could have been the problem. As a lower level employee, we needed certain things that weren't being provided by our manager.
Advice to Management
Hold upper management accountable for their mistakes and job performance. When lower employees see mediocrity tolerated they feel unmotivated to work harder and also lose hope that the environment will become better.

","Executive leadership is so preoccupied doing everything except identifying and addressing the company’s true underlying challenges and incompetencies, which has left them hopelessly out of touch with their staff. They grasp onto every latest and greatest development and organizational methodology “du jour,” reap all of the glory for introducing a fresh idea to the company, and then push deployment of that fresh idea to their hopelessly overloaded middle management without any guidance, support and, in many cases, budget.

The biggest challenge of the company is that there are far too many people in the wrong roles. Technical people are doing process/project management work and analysts are performing in technical roles. People are shuffled around the company with no regard to their skill set or even job preference. While in many cases this shuffling is done for budget alignment and/or to save an individual whose role was eliminated, in the end this practice serves only to disrupt the masses, resulting in poorly defined and communicated processes, excessive task complexity and redundancy, and a lot of ticked off staff who are frustrated when they learn that the very task they’ve been putting their heart and soul into has also been delegated to another team or staff member.

Use consultants to more clearly define teams and organizational roles and competencies, and assess staffing against those role definitions.

","I worked for Fannie Mae for about 4 yrs, a little over a year as a contractor and the rest as an FTE. My nick name for Fannie Mae is ""Stepford"" after the famous original movie and remake. Everyone walks around there with a fake ""installed"" smile on their face. They will drink the Kool-Aid or they will be gone! I was pulled over by my boss in the hallway for coughing on a conference call. If you have seen the original or remake of the movie ""Stepford Wives"" you will get the idea. My professional IT career stretches 37 years and I've worked for many different organizations during that time. Never have I worked for an organization more concerned about the slightest “real” emotion emoted. No expressed frustration allowed, no expressed anger allowed. OK, I can hear you, this is someone with no social skills or someone who doesn’t know how to behave at work. NO, I can assure you I’m not some crazy overly emotional person who runs up and down the hallways screaming that the sky is falling or acting like my hair is on fire. I’m a real person, and real people occasionally get frustrated and angry.
I transferred to my 2nd of two positions during my stint at Fannie a year before I was “laid off”. I had 4 managers during that 1 year period of time. What you see on Glassdoor reviews about re-orgs is absolutely true ─ very frequent. They also execute lay-offs about once a quarter. Maybe not unlike some organizations, but hopefully unlike most organizations, they use this lay off cycle to get rid of people they don’t like and don’t want to be bothered with going through formal HR steps that are required “in writing” by the organization to work with the employee to guide the performance of the employee to be more in line with their position or with the desires of their manager.
I was told by a colleague that my boss told said colleague that he thought I was a horrible PM (20+yrs experience) and that he planned to “manage me out”, i.e. make me so miserable I would “self-migrate” . My bosses actions had already started to mimic that kind of behavior. He was visibly, with malice of foresight, getting in the way of me doing the job I was hired to do. After 37+ yrs as a professional, it’s not like I’ve never seen this behavior before, but it had never been directed at me personally. If you’ve never had this happen to you, well, great for you! If so, I feel your pain.
This behavior stopped at some point after I confronted my manager, but the giant had just gone to sleep. Next lay off, yep, I was gone. Three days later, my old job was posted on the job boards. Never a single word was said to me by my boss that there was a single issue with my performance or any guidance to modify my behavior or deliver anything more or differently than the status quo. 
With the exception of my boss, and the director who must’ve been complicit, I loved the work I did at Fannie Mae. I was a “one stop shop” POC for the service my team provided. I received multiple service awards and multiple glowing emails from customers who were extremely pleased with the service I provided. I believe the issue was that I wasn’t subservient enough for my authoritarian boss who went to military boys school and has no college education what so ever.
Advice to Management
Acknowledge that people are human beings either at work or not. I'm not suggesting that the organization tolerate behavior that requires anger management, but you are creating a culture of emotional robots that is toxic. Also, the policy of quarterly lay offs to ""manage out"" those that management just wants to ""get rid of"" through no issue of lack of performance, but simply due to a less than perfect personality fit between employee and manager should be ended. Not to mention, if you have to re-org every quarter or twice a year you have a bigger issue.

Fannie Mae's Credit Managers in NUC in Dallas are a joke! They are all friends and that’s how they got hired, transferred or promoted.
Fannie Mae is over burdened with management that are friends or (stepford wife) type behavior.
5 years into my job my manager encouraged me to apply for the America disability act where I was accepted by management in DC and accommodated for my disability, however after 6 months I was laid off due to the computer program I used for my disability being dated as well as my laptop having low memory and would not allow updates for the outdated software. Management kept telling me I would be getting a new computer which would accommodate the software. The day before I was laid off, I went to speak with my manger in regards to the program glitches and slowness and He (my manager) assured me, that I was not being penalized for getting my daily production, and my new lap top was going to be delivered within the next week or two.
I was laid off the next day and my HR representative was there and I stopped to ask her a question about being laid off and my disability and program compatibility and She did not even know I was approved for the accommodation as an American with Disability Act. There is something wrong with
 This scenario when the department HR did not even know about that. Also the layoff packet or separation agreement stated that if signed and accepted there could be no recourse on Fannie.
I signed as I needed my severance, however I initialed and wrote in that by signing this document, it did not include my American with disability as I believed that was the reason for the layoff.
I contacted the EEOC and filed a grievance, and after almost 1 year I was informed that the grievance could not be enacted as I signed the paperwork to receive my severance. The copy they sent me did not include included a different page than the one I crossed out the disability act, my statement and my initials, that page has some else’s signature. No one will follow up on this.

But some of the people are amazing!,0,"As in any workplace, there are some truly amazing individuals who will create a great experience for you. These are the leaders who have emotional intelligence; colleagues who truly care; and managers that are looking out for you. Fannie Mae has those gems within the organization. 

The pay and benefits are pretty competitive. At certain levels of the organization you receive a market-rate salary in addition to long-term incentives for retention. Benefits typically compare to other governmental or quasi-governmental organizations. 

Fannie Mae is headed in the right direction. More work needs to be done on shaping the culture to be slightly less toxic and stop tolerating jerks, but there is heart there.
","On the flip side of the great people described above, there are some truly horrible people who can sour the experience quickly. You see typical managers who aren't very good at managing; leaders who clearly ascended the corporate ladder at Fannie (or elsewhere) without ever needing to show an ounce of leadership or strategic thinking; and colleagues who are complacent. 

The culture is risk-adverse and not very inclusive, and there are toxic individuals who are tolerated and promoted. There is great opportunity for the company to being friendlier, more forgiving, and less horrible to each other. 

Managers matter. Train and assess their effectiveness.

","Constant layoffs - the enterprise is scheduled to be continually pared down; consequently every 6 months to a year, there is a significant round of layoffs, usually spanning one or two divisions. Unfortunately, the folks who always seem to make it through unscathed, or who are quickly rehired into other positions are frequently the ones who started in the 80's and 90's and are generally accepted to be unqualified and lazy. HR is a joke and employees joke about how HR exists only to protect management from the actions of these people.

Bottom line: want to work for Fannie? Get ready to go through several reorgs and managers within a couple years and count on getting at least one manager who has been laid off and rehired three times (sometimes inexplicably getting two- to three-step promotions upon rehire!), who takes credit for your work and tries to throw you under the bus when he/she fouls something up or his/her general incompetence is exposed.

There are some departments that seem to function normally, but it is the exception rather than the rule. If you find a bright leader to work under, stick with them, because there aren't many to be found. Support for volunteer activities was a plus.
","Fannie Mae is a company floundering in an overall lack of direction and an unusually high level of ineptitude in most levels of management. There were certainly some smart managers and employees, but too many were not. While many of the problems at Fannie are self-made, some are due to not being able to do much of anything without the guidance and approval of an extremely slow to react regulator, which is a political beast in itself. So in the end you have ineffective management trying to implement the direction from a regulator that can't decide what it wants to do. What you have left is a bunch of managers fighting for some kind of relevancy and trying to survive at the expense of others in the company.

","An unexperienced 33 year old CISO who fired all the best talent, plays favorites, and continually says one thing and does another. He first action as CISO was to fire 20% of the staff and then remove flexible work schedules. Right after the firing he bragged about how he was bringing in a cohort of individuals who were trained for 12 weeks by a staffing firm. He ended up firing several talented people because they came in after 9:30 even though they worked late. In one case he made one very respected employee fill a higher position with more work and the same pay for about a year only to give the position to someone else. It was chaotic and unpredictable with the CISO in charge. He is building a work environment where the entire security organization will be in a large open area which will be difficult for all the people that need to concentrate. It isn't a Wall Street brokerage after all. He also has talked about a shark tank for employees, where you have to pitch ideas to management, who will proceed to rip you apart. What kind of message does that send to employees when they are the prey and management are the sharks?

I have been working at Fannie Mae full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Great benefits and compensation. Work life balance is great. People are very smart.
Cons
Never a way to have a great company year under the shroud of conservatorship. Everything requires many kingdoms to cooperate and politics rule. The story about the work and what it means to your bosses promotion is more important than the work itself. There is a cultural war between people doing the work and people getting the praise for being in the meeting presenting it to management.

Thu Jun 05 2014, Non Technical PM III,"Herndon, VA",Current Employee ,A good company if you know what you're getting into,1,"Fannie Mae has dug itself out of the hole it found itself in a few years ago. If you go in with your eyes open, it can be a stable environment with good work/life balance. The hours on the non-tech side are not very onerous and depending on your manager, working from home is a distinct possibility. Compensation seems to be above average, though not stellar.
","This is not the place for someone looking to move quickly. Both in their day to day work, and their career mobility. 

It is very process heavy, though they're trying to reduce that a bit.

In the division in which I work, there is not a lot of risk-taking or ownership. Particularly at mid-level mgmt, there seems to be a lot of risk aversion. It's understandable, given the company's history, but it's frustrating.

I would guess that the federal government is going to milk Fannie and Freddie for all they, and not turn them back to their shareholders any time soon. Which means even more risk-aversion and a government worker attitude.

Half the people I work with have PMPs. And most of those people are not really project managers.
