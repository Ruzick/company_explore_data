Mon Feb 01 2021, Senior Business Systems Analyst,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,Highly Engaged and Supportive Culture,1,"Long-term, American Express will take care of their employees. Between cash bonuses, profit-sharing, and 401k match, there is a reason why my colleagues have spent 10+ years with the company. There are always trainings being offered to acquire new skills as well as programs to loan employees to other business areas in order to gain exposure. Lastly, hierarchy, at least where I am, exists only on paper. I have gotten as much 1-on-1 time with my VP as I have my director as I have my manager. If you seek to make connections, your efforts will be rewarded.
","As with any large company, understanding where there are opportunities to advance your career can be difficult to find and navigate. There are resources to help, but not really guides on how to properly use those resources. If you work on a global team, rather than one that is based in a country, figuring out how to advance without completely relocating can be challenging.
Advice to Management
Continue to invest in making example career paths in the company for different types of employees. There are so many avenues that it becomes hard to figure out where to start your journey.

If you’re on a big project it can definitely help your career otherwise it’s sink or swim as nobody will focus on what you do.
","Given I saw hiring and year end rating processes it is even more frustrating in hindsight how this company focuses on playing favorites and making it incredibly difficult for some people to get promoted while others play the coffee chat culture and move up quickly while just delivering their work. On top of that the salary is absolutely mediocre compared to other companies in NYC, especially in financial services. Stay here too long and you’ll forget that companies are giving you total comp packages that are a minimum of 20% more for the SAME job level. Yet for a promotion here, I had to fight for a 8% increase and I wasn’t at the top range of my level. Come here for a couple of years for the mat/pat leave benefit and get out ASAP.

It can be even more frustrating if you have a substandard manager and you have to basically do their job for them while being underpaid. They also require you to stay in your role after a promotion for 18-24 months before they would support (or allow) you to move to another area of the Company if you did want another opportunity.

They used to support movement throughout the Company years ago but with high turnover typically 1-2 people get stuck with all the work as people leave and then you can get stuck because

Advice to Management
Don't conduct promotions in waves. When an employee deserves a promotion, make it clear what the criteria are and promote them on a person-by-person basis. It doesn't make much sense to have 20 people in a sub org get promotions at the same time because they likely joined and progress at different rates.

Be transparent. It won't hurt the company having employees know what's going on in management. Secrecy only loses trust.

Just another call center job . This company is so focused on backing their card members they don’t realize that their employees need to be backed as well . On top of living during a pandemic they continue to make drastic changes and pile more workload on employees. With lack of training and notice . Before you know it you’ll be completely burned out . Management act like robots . Amex just needs a clean slate . Upper management in travel servicing needs to be replaced along with ceo

-Seems to sincerely care about diversity, though sometimes the efforts miss the mark
-Has had an incredible response to the COVID pandemic. Has put the employees first every step of the way.
","-very little mentorship opportunities for band 30 engineers (entry to mid-level engineers)
-still has some very 'bro'-like ways of evaluating engineers. The 'bros' are the ones who tend to excel. Anyone else falls by the wayside.
-female engineers need quality feedback from the leaders and accountability just like male engineers
-if you are lgbt or have no interest in having children, there's no great benefits for you as a counterpart to the parental leave. So get ready to have to cover for your teammates for 5 months at a time over and over and over again and get nothing in return.
Advice to Management
Being 'diverse' is more than just hiring women, black people, latinx people, lgbt, trans people. It's about hiring people with different life experiences, who process information differently, and then not asking them to change as soon as they arrive to be more like regular engineers.

","I could write a novel on the cons. I was hired as an engineer, but I haven't written code longer than five lines since I started here. We just slap spreadsheets into tables, and voila! we're engineers.

Our leader is unable to make and adhere do a decision and severely lacks leadership skills. It has taken us nearly one full year to build a report portal. This is something that could have been done by a group of high school kids in a few weeks.

Trying to bring in external tools to make our jobs more efficient is nearly impossible. The red tape is so thick, it would be faster to build your own operating system than try to buy useful software.

The group I work for seems to want to find problems for their solutions instead of solving actual business problems. I heard a funny term, ""resume driven development"".

As mentioned in other reviews, AMEX is not a place to grow your skills, but a place to get complacent and cash checks. If you're eager to learn, grow, and do amazing things, keep looking. This is not the place for growth. If you're close to retiring and want to put your feet up on your desk for 7.5 hours a day, welcome aboard.

-Amazing work life balance (depends on team)
-Real work learning opportunities such as coding (SQL/Python)
-Upwards mobility specially if coming in as a Analyst/Sr. analyst

Over all an amazing company to work in. Although some things depend on what team you are in, my Pros apply to most of the company. Have not really seen bad culture/work life balance teams, but have heard of them through word of mouth. Great learning Financial Service opportunity without the hyper A Personality culture of the industry.
","-PTO days do lack a little when starting as an Analyst. Due to the fact that holidays must be taken from your PTO totals. Also PTOs do not roll over or get paid out (You can buy PTOs and you get your money back if not used during the year). For me this balances out due to the work life balance I have.
-Health insurance has a high deductible even when getting the most expensive (even then not too expensive if Single or Married). This does balance out by being offered a HSA which the company contributes a sum at beginning of each year (which depend on your doctor would cover your copays).
-Layoffs and Reorgs. Like many companies you hear of layoffs and Reorgs which suck and it is a con. What many people do not tell you is that Layoffs usually occur at VP or higher levels and a Reorg usually gets a couple months notice and a package if you do not find anything. Again does not feel good if you end up in this situation (and hope I never have to be in it), but it is not like the movies where the same day you pack your things and go.

I was told that the diversity at Amex was a facade when I first started. I ignored the warning and didn't believe that an industry leader such as Amex could partake in discriminatory and exclusionary practices. There's a reason that discrimination is mentioned in Glassdoor reviews. It's prevalent. Amex claims diversity and inclusion in their Glassdoor intro and beyond for marketing and recruitment efforts only. They're checking a box because it's trendy and upheld by law, but there's nothing done in practice. HR does nothing to stop discrimination when reported and will protect their racist managers even when showing proof of discrimination and harassment. The racial tension that's on display throughout the country right now is alive and well at Amex. You'll be shocked by the amount of stories that you'll hear about former employees leaving because of the discrimination they faced while working there. This is the reality. You've been warned.

I have been working at American Express full-time for less than a year
Pros
18+/hr starting - WAH positions available
Cons
Where to start. The training isn't organized and is hard to follow. No real examples of what the job entails. You learn as you go and fill in the blanks from talking to other confused colleagues. Not all but a good bit of Team Leads are rude and short with you. Asking questions will be hard because the department is run on a teach yourself attitude. Condescending leadership. Everything you do effects their bonuses so many are not friendly. I literally have only worked here 8 months and already looking for new employment. Working here has taken my 5+ years in travel and made me re think my degree and life choices. Lol. The customers are absolutely rude and treat you like servants. Ofcourse their are a few that aren't but most will rush you and demand the moon. There's so much more. Just make sure to take the things you may be reading seriously into account. Most of it is true. I looked at Glassdoor before my start and didn't take the things I saw seriously. I fully regret that now. I'm depressed and it's time to go.
Advice to Management
Direct leadership should know how to interact with their team without being rude or condescending. You get more and better results with honey vs vinegar.

Be more tuned in to your employees' individual needs. They are working hard for you, listen to them and help them develop and succeed. 
Hire supervisors who have been there! If they haven't had hands-on day-to-day experience, it's hard for them to support their team. It's frustrating and counterproductive. 
Don't kick out your experienced agents. If you're trying to remain competitive, you need their loyalty and the knowledge that they bring to the table. Sure you may save a few bucks by hiring and training newbies, but think of the bigger picture. Look at the CSI's!

","During my interview, I was told that there is ""unlimited income potential"". What they didn't tell me is that AmEx keeps moving the bar further away as you get closer to the finish line. The metrics are unfair and unrealistic to earn a regular bonus. Every customer gets an opportunity to submit a survey, however, the LAST AmEX employee to speak to the customer, during each call, is upon whom the survey falls. Therefore, if the customer speaks to collections first, and gets angry during the call, then collections transfers the call to you to discuss having misplaced their credit card, everything they say in the angry survey is credited to YOU. One survey with a ""poor"" rating will cause you to lose your entire bonus for a rolling 3 month period! Another unfair metric is counted when you assist a customer and they call again within 7 days. Even if the customer calls back for a totally different reason, the fact that they called at all within 7 days means you did not properly assist them. For example, if the customer calls you to pay their bill, then 3 days later calls again for a password reset, THAT is counted against YOU because the customer called back within 7 days. This, too, counts against your bonus. Further, there are no assigned workspaces. Seating is in a first-come-first-selected area. You are assigned a locker for your personal belongings, but change desks from shift-to-shift. The workspace is approximately 20x40 with only a small panel between each desk. That, coupled with changing each day, makes the area unsanitary, and presents a high risk of illness due to spreading germs.

Fri Jul 26 2019, Manager,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Great work culture; need to back off on the multi-level approvals,1,"- Amex has one of the best work culture. There are always ""activities"" to keep employees engaged. I love that we can bring ourselves to work, unlike other companies where you have to act a certain way. However, there are disadvantages to this - some people forget that they're in a professional environment and should act with respect and (real) courtesy. 
- The benefits are great. 
- The Corporate Social Responsibility team does a great job raising awareness, acting on its commitments, and pushing employees to give back to their communities through service or donations. However, I would like to see Amex go beyond sustainability initiatives.
","- ""Alignment"" is a term that I never thought I would hate. Everything (even the most minuscule thing) has to be reviewed by each level before it can go out. This delays projects and is rather counterproductive, but yet Amex continues to do it. 
- This year, the company launched a campaign that focuses on the employee culture. It's supposed to include internal, but at the moment is focused on external applicants and sharing ""why is great to work at Amex"". I haven't seen much benefits so far. 
- There are too many tenured employees. While they do bring value, there's not enough out-of-the-box thinking or fresh perspective. Everyone speaks in Amex-speak, which can come off as cultish.
- It is very hierarchical - I've never seen a company so fixated on hierarchy. I would never recommend, with experience, come in as an Analyst because the benefits suck - like they have less vacation days (WTH). Fortunately, they're now finally eligible for bonuses.
- I get strategy change, but Amex takes re-orgs to another level. In my less than 2 years at Amex, there have been many re-orgs. I'm anticipating there will be a big one based on movements. 
- The salary is lower in comparison to similar companies. The bonus is not bad.

Job security is decent. Be a top performer and you will never need to worry. Also they love it/value when people stay in the same field for 20+ years. They treat you well.

It is a good starting point at American Express.

Vacation time is a nice amount if Full-time.

They are good at meeting you where they can. The minimum, average, and maximum hourly pay is accurate on Glassdoor. So negotiate.

Potlucks and parties are good. Co-workers really make the days go by faster.

You can move to a different department after 12 months (see cons).
","Unfortunately, if you want to move to a different department it is hard. Leaders/Managers will get discouraged and possibly jealous if they hear you want to move. Be tight lipped if that is your goal. Seen too many people passed on for leadership roles because they mentioned they want to move to other departments.

Leaders do not like it when you discover things sooner than them or know more than them. They get intimidated, which is human. 

Hours can be tough if you lose out on shift bids. 

Good luck taking off on major holidays.

If you dream of more than answering calls all day, this career path may not be for you. 

Some people have MBAs, MAs, BAs, or Associates. Some people have life experience. Some people have little to no experience. All are paid the same.

A new recruit can surpass you in a few months because seniority is not important anymore. Performance is the new seniority.

The pay is also competitive and you get to work remote. All necessary work equipment is provided by the company (laptop, printer, docking station, monitor, etc). The job requires you to travel to meet with existing clients but the company either pays for your mileage or they allow you to rent a car. 

Management has been terrific, in my experience. I feel like my directors and VPs have my back and I don’t live in fear of termination if I have a slow month or quarter. Leadership is good about being transparent when change occurs and they set clear expectations. They are also really good about setting time for 1:1 calls and making themselves available when needed. This is important because working remote can sometimes be a challenge when you need help or have a question. 

The final thing I’ll say is that the paid time off is very generous (and you can buy more) and the company doesn’t let your PTO roll over into the next calendar year. This is amazing because it encourages people to take their PTO without guilt or fear of backlash.

","They've gone from a relatively cautious, adverse organization to pretend like they're some bleeding edge Silicon Valley powerhouse. Some fresh out of college ""consultant"" recommendations rewriting the core authorization platform (currently written in Assembly language) in Go and leadership takes it under serious consideration. LOL!!! Really? 

Again, they're trying to be something they're not and that spells disaster for the ""workers"" that have to ""tow the line"" to meet unrealistic demands while dealing with constant reorgs and cost cutting initiatives. It used to be that Lead Programmer Analysts should be SMEs and team leaders that didn't code much at all.

I'm excellent at sales but this is a whole new level.
","1. Since focus has changed to hardcore sales management and leadership treat you like a number.
2. Reps know more than their management who only know how to copy and paste.
3. If you're amazing at customer service and average at sales, they will never acknowledge it
4. To advance in the virtual environment you have to be kissing management Butt by laughing at their dumb jokes.
5. Expect a lot of interim roles which allow management to test out how much you kiss butt, if not enough...back to the phones you Go.
6. The India and Manila centers hardcore force sales down card members throats. And their communication skills between other departments lack. And they cold transfer poor survey calls to U.S. Reps
7. Card members a entitled and defending as if you are beneath them.
8. Tech team we reach out to for troubleshooting our computers and phones from home aren't nice. So good luck getting help.
9. Team leaders make commission off us reps so they hinder you and talk you out of applying for advanced positions as that will cut their pay.
10. Team leaders don't take the time to get to know their employees any longer. Team leaders are repetitious.

I had an analyst tell me, we hope one day you “turn” blue like us. Way to go amex.

I worked at American Express full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
If you are a person who lives for good benefits and job security, this company is for you. If you pride yourself as innovative and an independent thinker, run as far as you can.
Cons
American Express is a private club, not only for its card members, but for its employees. It is a mutual admiration society, and on most days, resembles an incestuous clique. If you are part of the right team, and should be lucky to find a good leader, then all is well. If you find yourself on a team where you don't fit in, you will suffer a lot, as it is a consensus culture where your ideas will not be respected unless ALL members of your team agrees. The by-product of this culture is SUPER SLOW BUSINESS SPEED and total LACK OF INNOVATION. They always promote from within, so its the same people in 12 different roles and titles. Same boring ideas, same pat on the back for mediocre group think. Leaders are generally poor quality, even though they are forced to go through this Harvard leadership certificate program (most don't even show up to class or do their work but get the certificate anyway). There are few opportunities to move up as everyone stays around forever because of the benefits.
Advice to Management

They do pay you well as a Travel Counselor . But you become a prisoner at your own home . Not worth the money .
","Hiring process was ok . The training was long , is about 12-14 weeks long .They cover so much unnecessary information , I feel like some parts of the training are useless and they don’t prepare you in any way for the real job . They want you to participate in class so be prepared for instructor to call your name if you’re quiet . Listen & Interact and you will make it . 

During end of training most our classmates wanted to listen to recorded calls so we could see the the flow of a call . They were never able to provide a call from beginning to end with a a screen . They could only provided a few sloppy calls where they were just short & no screen just audio and not even a sale . We couldn’t believe that a company as big as Amex couldn’t provide a decent recorded call .They weren’t able to provide a clear understanding on how metrics & surveys works. (It was probably our team lead who wasn’t well informed) . 

When you start taking calls be prepare to deal with customers who feel like they’re the queens . Some would talk down to you & be super rude . Most of the calls are from members who are well traveled and know what they want . You’re just an order taker , also be prepare to deal with multiple different systems at the same time .(always slow and crash often) you’re not allow to tell customers our system doesn’t work but you’re not allow for dead air . Customer don’t care to chat they would keep asking you to hurry up because they don’t have time . Also be ready to deal with rude employees. if they’re training you they would talk to you as if you were 5 year old . You can also find them in other departments. They would just hang up on you or wound school you for “not doing your job “ correct .

However, AMEX became more bureaucratic with more redundant and incompetent mid-managers . As a result, smart talents were treated unfairly and there was a talents exodus in 2017 to 2018.

Political garbage masked under the facade of jeans and sneakers. Make no mistake, everyone here is eager to throw you under the bus. I have never met so many mean people in competition with one another (as a result of poor leadership, also throwing their peers under the bus). 

Too many MBA's in mid-level management who don't know how to do work but frantically run around from meeting to meeting, giving the illusion of doing work. People with airs of self-importance over meaningless jobs are at every corner. What takes any other place a week would take Amex about 6 months - no one here is brave enough to make a decision and VPs are micro-managers who need their managers running through every rabbit hole before getting to ""yes."" And when something does take too long for a reason, there is always someone to blame, rather than the understanding that Amex is a huge company that requires a lot of back and forth and facilitation among the teams. 

It doesn't get any more political than this place, where you're valued on how many coffee chats you have, how pretty your decks are (for internal meetings. Did I miss the memo on needing an agency design degree to present to my boss?), rather than your work. ""Thought leadership"" constantly pushed, but then ideas are dismissed immediately. Incredibly de-motivating place to work when you have to jump through hoops and are encouraged to fake a personality if you are not exactly ""Blue Box.""

I've heard of someone whose leader now makes the team do two networking activities a week. This is more like summer camp where employees are scolded and babied rather than treated like adults with decision-making power. 

This place is utterly lacking in heart. The eagerness with which tones of condescension are employed rather than camaraderie and light-heartedness is astounding.
Advice to Management
Trim the fat. Stop making decks, and ""strategies"" and do some actual work. Teach your employees to be kind to one another.

American Express focuses on winning with integrity, collaboration, respect, and embracing diversity and inclusion. It also strives very hard to be a good corporate citizen and supports the causes i believe in. That culture makes it a good fit with my own values and makes me proud to work here. 

All job openings except the very most senior ones are posted openly on the internal job site. That transparency, coupled with the fact that we are a company of 55k people, located in dozens of countries, business units and job disciplines means that with the right focus and management, you can take your career in practically any direction you wish.

Amex usually does not have the highest salaries in absolute terms, but it's always increasing its benefits. In 2008, it opened a backup onsite daycare for employees and their children. About three years ago, it introduced 6-month paid leave for new parents. And this year it introduced a new bonus program for entry level employees.
","The focus on collaboration can sometimes be overdone, and we lose speed as we try to get consensus. As i mentioned, the salaries are not in the top percentile so you may be frustrated here if you value compensation above everything else. The company is constantly trying to reinvent itself and try different organizational configurations, so it may be tough if you're not comfortable dealing with constant, rapid change.

If you take too many bathroom breaks you can even be written up ( 3 bathroom breaks a day would cause you a write up due to how it affects your adherence to schedule). Many employees rather call out and take time unpaid than actually go in and get paid because they hate their job that much. You develop severe anxiety because your micromanaged, watched and listened to every single second of the day. Every single thing about American Express is a con. Promotions are based off who you know, not what you know. The new upper management only cares about sales. Money is their only motive and if you’re not making them money in sales you’re deemed useless. Upper management has no idea how to coach people, and normally will only coach the people they want to fire. They will document, document, document until they have enough to fire someone. Professional growth is impossible since they never let you off the phones. And the people they do promote are the idiots that sucked up. Your job is never guaranteed they are constantly sending jobs to India, should change the name to India Express.

If you want people to be happy stop micromanaging them. Let people take bathroom breaks without penalty. After call is needed even for just a minute we need it for our mental sanity.

Feels good to work for a brand that does cool stuff and is respected. Flexible work arrangements are amazing and 20 week paternity leave at full pay for fathers is practically unheard of elsewhere (26 weeks for mothers). Amex has gotten quite good at product management (not the case 3 years ago) so if you are interested in product, you can learn a lot here.
","When amex lost the Costco partnerships the company had to tighten its belt significantly or fail and famously cut $1 billion of cost. While I’ve noticed some nice things slowly coming back (like being able to fly business class on longer work flights), some frustrating stuff like overcrowded open floors, not always having a permanent desk, and - seriously - not enough trash cans, don’t make you feel like everything is being done to make you comfortable. Some teams also are not particularly agile so getting things done isn’t always super speedy. If you like the freedom of working at a small entrepreneurial company where you can pretty much do anything, this is not a place for you.

This facility is immaculate and full of conveniences. The location is surrounded by expanses of empty land, so if you want to leave for lunch, you have to get in your car. That being said, each of the three buildings have some type of store or cafe, and there are vending machines in every break room on every floor. I felt lucky to be working there when I would walk in the building. 

In addition to having great facility, the culture at this location is really interesting, and varies from team to team, department to department. People talk freely, and collaboration is easy to accomplish. I happened to have excellent leaders above me, who valued work-life balance, and took a practical approach to the logistics of accomplishing task.
","While I was working there, parking was a nightmare. I have heard that a parking structure has been/is being erected, but I can't speak to its efficacy. Another con is privacy. The facility is mostly open floor plan, long tables with low partitions and mounted monitors. Seats were not assigned, and reserving your seat was a very frustrating task for some.
