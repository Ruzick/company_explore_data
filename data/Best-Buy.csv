It was a very welcoming environment, which allowed new employees to strive in a fast pace workforce. Another pro to working at Best Buy is the nonstop growth they offered. Each day always presented something new and it allowed me to learn how to deal with multiple obstacles that were present each day.
","Although working at Best Buy was interesting, it did have a few cons to the company. First, the inconsistency with hours among employees. There were barely any hours for employees and i felt that there should have been an equal chance for everyone to have similar or reasonable hours to work. Next, there was the scheduling of employees. Workers were scheduled poorly and majority of the times when people were needed we didnt have the manpower for certain days.
Advice to Management
My advice to management is to work on better scheduling and providing more hours for people to actually be able to support themselves even if they aren't full-time. Part-time workers are important too.

","Company has terrible *real* values -- they say one thing and do another. All of their ""empathetic"" PR buzzwords mean nothing when it comes to real management and daily practice.

Furthermore, the company has become ""woke."" When I say ""woke,"" I mean they go out of their way to hire people based on their ""identity"" instead of their work ethic or skillset. They also allow their HR department to be weaponized against employees that are disliked, not because they did anything wrong (it's common to use HR to go after employees for things they've said/done OUTSIDE of the workplace).

Furthermore, when they increase wages, they increase them evenly across the board; they do not consider the work ethic, skill set, or years with the company for these increases.

Example: I was with the company for 7 years. I've worked in 4 different positions during that time, have always had OPEN availability, always came in when they asked, and missed TWO days this entire last year (a single manage would miss 5x as many).

Yet when it comes to wage increases, new hires suddenly make $4/hr more and I make $1 more (New hire wage increased from $10/hr to $15, my wages increased from $14 to $15).

Not the type of company you want to have a career in, unless you 're corporate, perhaps.

I have been working at Best Buy part-time for more than a year
Pros
Like-minded co-workers, usually great people around your age with similar interests. Get to see newest technologies and hold it in your hands. Employee discount.
Cons
Extremely poorly managed, hours are dwindling and the schedule is so poorly created. Company policies are inefficient and unhelpful. Apple clients are the worst and we get mostly those people. Apple lies about what we can do for clients and so they arrive ill-informed without an appointment and blame us for not being able to take them as a walk-in. Haven't actually been able to train properly since I started working in September.
Advice to Management
Properly train your employees or simply hire better people. So many detractors are due to people not knowing things and being poorly trained. The store is being run so poorly, people are leaving and taking 10 days for the sake of getting away from it all. I myself have taken a 10 day because the stress made me physically sick.

","In my store, this was the position that also had to deal with cameras, dvd's, video games, and magnolia. This includes helping any customers that go over there and worst of all, cleaning up the section at the end of the day. Depending on whether you are closing alone or not, cleaning these sections can take between 30 minutes to an hour.

Another point is the store I was in was like a high school. Management dated new employees, some got pregnant from others. Some employees wouldn't work for weeks because the management didn't like them. A lot of sketchy stuff happens as well behind closed doors. I would avoid this job unless you want to work at it for a little. DO not make this your career.

","The downsides are that for some reason after the pandemic started stores have gotten considerably busier and there has been no attempt to reduce or compensate the load it's taking on its employees. The company minimum wage was raised but the bonuses were removed so it ends up evening out to the old system. You are pressured to push sales and credit cards with no reward.
Advice to Management
Advice to management would be to try and award your sales associates for pushing and hitting numbers that you need. I understand it's stressful for you as it reflects your management ability but if sales associates have no reason to sell them it becomes hard to see why one should go the extra mile for each transaction.

Very forward thinking on LGBT+ community recognition and education, extremely awesome for that aspect of company culture

","Store level management engaged in favoritism, and the general culture throughout my district was generally toxic no matter which store you were working at; managers picked favorite employees, favored sales employees and completely undervalued and devalued anything the operations teams did, refused to understand any part of the logistics of the warehouse or what the warehouse team was responsible for. Store managers also thought they had authority to change certain rules or make their own decisions to disregard communications from corporate if the communications didn't suit their personal interest or if they didn't want to change a lot of things in their own store to accommodate the new requirements from corporate. Management would also constantly put on a facade for any district level managers or anyone who toured the stores from corporate to make it appear as if everything in the store was following all directives from corporate fully, even if that was not the case. Sexual harassment from one employee to other employees and to managers/supervisors was allowed to continue for the entirety of my time in the store, until someone finally spoke up about the matter and there was some investigations done. When that resulted in that person being let go, the store intended to shift that role's responsibilities on to another team member in an attempt to not have to promote someone and create another vacancy so that also resulted in them attempting to sidestepping hiring someone to take over the position all together. 
Corporate's communications about company culture made the company seem really cool; however, the store level company culture is very poor and relies heavily on favoritism and being a sales associate vs any sort of ""support"" role.
They also did poorly at adjusting employees' salaries as their starting pay increased. I had been working there for 4 years and found out that people who were being hired presently were making amounts equal to or more than what I had achieved through merit increases.

After that there like a kid bored with there toys and throw them away. I use to recommend this company but not any more, corporate has some weird mind set that they can compete with and do better than Amazon and are running the company into the ground.

Advice to Management
Please do not neglect your employees. I was hired as a seasonal team member to work during the holiday season. I didn't get scheduled anymore after a week. For the first 2 weeks of not being scheduled, the manager called and explained why. (no room on the schedule) After that, no more calls. I tried calling the store and HR multiple times, but during every attempt I was either hung up on or left on hold for hours. I went to the store and they told me they didn't have time to train new employees and they'd call when they have time. I still haven't been called, and am now considering myself unemployed. 

Why hire seasonal employees if you can't train them for the season they were hired for? It's a huge shame, because Best Buy seemed like a genuinely good company to work for, and the job seemed like it would be fun. It just doesn't make sense. Please, don't hire employees if you don't plan to train them or put them on the schedule at all.

Wed Dec 02 2020, Part,"Dublin, CA",Current Employee ,Great Company to work for!,0,"Acceptable pay - At the time of my interview I mentioned that i had another job offer, and was asked to disclose the amount of pay I was offered. That may have had an impact on my pay of $16.

Flexible schedule - I could ask for a weekend off last minute and have it approved. I could also ask for more or less hours and have my schedule reflect in the following week. Sometimes even pick my own schedule.

Communication and Networking Skills can be developed through the various interactions with customers. 

Sales Skills can also be developed and improved on as Best Buy tends to push credit card applications (it really is great), and their tech support program that many non tech savvy people appreciate. However, if you don’t like sales then you can get away with just selling what the customer asks for and be fine as a season worker. 

Friendly and motivated Employees - Most Best Buy employees genuinely enjoy working for Best Buy, and if they don’t they leave after about a year. Most are also motivated to sell and appreciate getting rewarded by the managers.
","Redundant - Eventually, the day becomes repetitive

There’s no much else to say that’s bad about Best Buy. It’s a great company that’s great for seasonal, part time and full time employers who are, or are not looking to climb up the chain.

- Co- Workers
","- They never seem to have enough ppl every single day in each department. So you end up getting pulled from your department and can get represented for it and they’ll say “just call someone” but no one ever answers :/ Customers that come in there seem oh so very clueless so they end up taking the attention of someone for 15 minutes plus. But if you’re a customer that comes in after you’re pretty much sol. I’d recommend to anyone coming into Best Buy to do research at home. It’s almost impossible to get help and us customer service people at the front can’t 100% help you unless were cross trained. Other than that, Best Buy is pretty great.

1. Changing your mind on a store shelf that you've already directed labor towards breaks backs, wastes time, and demoralizes the worker doing the work. The review went from a 3 to a 2 and half the specific scores went down to 1 just remembering this anecdote.

2. Accept that there can be a point where a worker simply isn't busy, like 5:50 on a shift that ends at 6. Not every shift will be down to the wire, and if it isn't, you've done an especially good job scheduling people, because they were able to finish their work. If someone's resting their bones literally minutes before they would be allowed to clock out, especially overnight, that's your decision that worked out for the better, not someone being lazy.
