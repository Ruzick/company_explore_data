","The performance calibration and merit/bonus structure doesn’t reward for employee delivery but instead pits employees against each other in a rack and stack process. Training and Advancement beyond the TSM role is lackluster. Directors and VPs are blind to what first line managers and sales reps actually do and try to offer training or feedback which continues to confirm they are out of touch with their organizations. Every year there is an introduction of a new leadership model and priorities continuously change but at the end of the day, it’s the same message and different words but it affects employee adoption and morale.
Advice to Management
The general perception your high performing employees have is that you are just trying to create an environment that causes them to quit. You’ve created an environment for your Field Sales Teams that feels like we’re never good enough and what we contribute doesn’t matter. Because of that, you’ll continue to see employees give up and lose their passion to do a good job anymore. Focus on strategies for retention. Otherwise, you’re regularly starting from scratch with a new workforce and the business you’ve developed is much too nuanced to handle turnover of top performers.

You are treated like a child by upper management. Most Altria employees are absolutely miserable because the industry is in massive decline and their career outlook is bleak. There are limited to no advancement opportunities because the industry is declining and there are large scale lay offs every 2-3 years. You can get promoted if you play the game correctly, which means being a high performer and giving your life to the company by working 24/7 and moving at every promotion opportunity to wherever they choose. You have no say. There are much more lucrative industries to build your career at where you don’t have to sell your soul and life to work at.

Advice to Management
Being a Territory Sales Manager for Altria is tough, yet rewarding work - but the reward was lessened after dealing with poor management for over a year. 
I was so excited to start working full-time after a successful internship, however my passion and enthusiasm for the role quickly diminished after facing several issues. I went through four managers within a year, several of which who quit because of their dissatisfaction with the company and senior management. It was difficult to form strong relationships with managers because we would only see them a few times a month and we would be assigned a new manager within a few months, and it was even more difficult to get these new managers take understand my concerns regarding safety in the field and take them seriously. 
After reporting several incidents of harassment and security concerns with our retailers, I believed that Altria would stand by me and commute to those accounts that their behavior was unacceptable - however, the company continued to do business with them and not address the issues at hand. 
No matter how wonderful my coworkers are and how amazing and competitive the benefits are, I could not continue to work for a company that would choose their bottom-line over the safety and care of their employees.

","You can look at past reviews and see the same reoccurring issue. Unjustified promotions, managers managing people that have little experience themselves, and a culture of little to no transparency in promotional opportunities.

In the Florida zone, as a TSM and now as a Market Manager I’ve seen far too often a good TSM get overlooked because they weren’t one of the precious interns from the “recruitment schools”. 80% of the management team was “chosen” to be on the fast track with no merit from day one. One “recruit” was promoted, terrible at managing people and rather then demote her they promoted her into a non people managing role. Shuffle the deck, same bad cards. Another recruit threatened to leave due to lack of promotion after only 1 year, of course they were rushed into management. Experienced hires stand NO chance, and non recruitment school hires out of college have slightly more but still very little chance of being promoted.
Advice to Management
Even with the new LDA program, people are being “decided” in advance who “should” apply and who can apply but shouldn’t get their hopes up because “management” already has plans for specific people. Stop pushing college kids into management before they have mastered facilitation and managing others. Your best people are leaving for other CPG companies because the culture and promotion practices are terrible. 

3 layoffs in 7 years? Yikes, it all makes sense now...

Thu Feb 06 2020, Territory Sales Manager,,Current Employee ,Get Place to Get In and Out,15,"Compensation is extremely generous and the benefits are fantastic, the majority of coworkers (especially TSMs) and genuinely wonderful people, decent flexibility around the hours/times you work, if you can find the time and are self-driven you can work on some interesting projects.
","This is going to be long, but to summarize- great place to start your career or move into early in your career, get your MBA for free with their tuition reimbursement, and then get the hell out.

Over the last year the workload is becoming crushing- average store count in my area increased by ~60%, company has started using a Salesforce platform and made it mandatory to take pictures in each store to try and track and measure every task completed on a given visit, meaning they expect more work from more stores, yet they have been clear that there would be no increase in compensation in the foreseeable future. (Compensation is still much higher than the market average, but if you're doing more work for the same pay, it's going to rub people the wrong way)

POS materials are shipped directly to your house in massive quantities, but mostly with no indication for which accounts they are for or when they need to be placed, so expected to dedicate a garage/spare bedroom just to storing POS, and spending time on evenings or weekends organizing and refreshing your POS so it doesn't get completely out of hand. It's gotten worse recently, typically once a month you may receive around 10-15 boxes roughly 2x2x2' or larger, not including whatever you have to order to replace what you actually need but wasn't force shipped to you. This has been an issue for years but no real progress seems to be made against it.

Possibly the biggest issue is the total career stagnation and favoritism. If you come on board as an external hire rather than a intern, you should have zero expectation of getting ever being promoted unless you have a personal connection to someone at headquarters in Richmond. As others have mentioned, the most recent restructure flattened the field management structure and created ""leadership development associate"" rotation based training position as one of the only ways to get out of the field. There are over 1200 TSMs (until the next ""restructure""/layoff), and only ~20 of these LDA positions so you can do the math... plus between the preference for promoting interns with no other work experience to compare the low morale and toxic culture to, and the fact that people who were on the verge of promotion are de facto ""first in line"" waiting for those positions to open up- don't hold your breath on getting one. Interns or manager's favorites also have special projects doled out to them, transfer requests approved for them when others are not, more face time with 2nd and 3rd line managers, etc.

Oh, and then there are the bizarre decisions that come down from on high. Constant calls to ""transform our business!"" and become ""New AGDC!"", but they seem stuck on the model of throwing products out in the market to see what sticks, pushing TSMs to shove products onto retailers, only to turn around and pull them out when they flop (Anyone remember Verve?). Constantly claiming to be innovating and streamlining our operational platforms, but there seems to be no clear plan for how that works- everything is spread out across at least five different websites/platforms/applications which are constantly being recreated/dismantled/updated/moved. Not to mention the $13.8 BILLION dollar elephant in the room- the investment in Juul which as of the time of writing this has been written down by almost $9 billion. Senior leadership tries to sell everything they do as part of a brilliant master plan, but they're selling to their sales people who can see through the BS- a bad investment is a bad investment.

","After several rounds of layoffs over the past few years, Director+ positions are being forced to meet a quota for extending “below average” ratings to employees, at least in the Midwest Region. This is resulting in employees with historically “above average” ratings being put on PIPs and denied annual bonuses, many after a few short months in a brand new position without receiving any specific coaching or feedback. More concerning, it appears most manager-level employees being assigned PIPs exhibit similar personality traits (more-introverted), signaling the company is looking to weed out a specific personality type rather than based on a lack of skills, obviously exposing the company to potential employment-law risks.

This is a great place to intern and start a career, but if you don’t advance at least 3 times in 5 years, get out! And, unless you are extremely confident, don’t let them move you to a opportunity-less geography where you’re SOL if you decide to leave or are unexpectedly managed out.

Approx 55% of the entry level sales force are white males but only 15% of next line managers are such. Change white or male for any other option and you have built a lawsuit.

The pay is decent for the work you’re expected to do. The benefits, like the annual 401k drop and company car, are nice perks. There are some amazing employees, but many of them were recently let go or left during a restructure. Altria attempts to create a positive, diverse culture, but in the recent changes that’s all disappeared in less than a month.
","1. The CEO made it very clear he cares more about the investors than his employees. Funny thing is, it doesn’t seem like the investors care much for Altria or Howard at the moment. What once was a well performing stock has been crashing. The future is cloudy for Altria. 
2. Altria attempts to achieve Diversity and Inclusion. But when the going gets tough, like during the recent restructure, it’s clear that the white, conservative, straight man still has ALL the power. Inclusion requires action and there aren’t many examples of true inclusion. 
3. There has always been no clear career path for a TSM and very limited upward movement. With the recent changes, there is even less opportunity for career growth. 
4. Experienced hires are overlooked many employees are being underutilized. 
5. New structure seems to be an opportunity to micromanage and track employees. The freedom to create success within your territory has been removed. 
6. The sales roles are becoming over paid merchandizing roles.

Wed Nov 14 2018, Territory Manager,,Former Employee ,Dead end company - look elsewhere.,9,"Compensation is competitive for entry level candidates out of college, company car
","No upward mobility whatsoever, especially in areas of low volume. Management is perpetually scared about their jobs and inevitable reconstruction that the CEO occasionally acknowledges is coming soon. They don’t develop their employees and leave them out on an island to fend for themselves. This may be different in other parts of the country but upper management doesn’t seem to care about the lack of leadership or support middle managers give to their TSMs. Unless you are looking to get a quick 1-2 years of experience out of college, I would look elsewhere for opportunities. If you get the job, you will either quit from lack of development, or lose it abruptly from a reduction in the workforce. 

Also, I would be remiss if this wasn’t included: they talk about diversity and inclusion about everyday and drill it into the membranes of their employees heads that if you have a difference of opinion with their PR tactic of hiring diverse candidates, then you will be in big trouble. There is no diversity of thought in this company and if you don’t follow along with the liberal agenda, you won’t be around long. Most employees are rubbed the wrong way with the suffocation of this topic, and eventually this will only divide the company to a level of pure negativity and rebellion.

","So here's the deal with Altria.....the ""company policy"" handbook is approximately 367 million pages long. There is no possible way, any human being on earth, can abide by all of their policies, all of the time. Now whether this is by accident or by design is anybody's guess, but it certainly creates a toxic culture where targeting, politics, and favoritism runs rampant. Case in point - falsifying calls. There is not a TSM in this company that has not falsified a call at some point in their career (by Altria's definition of call falsification). Likewise, there's not a Unit Manager in this company that has not falsified a call at some point in their career. If they want to get rid of somebody, they simply target that individual until they catch them falsifying a call or breaking one of the other 3 billion company policies and throw them out on the street. Even though the person doing the firing has very likely, if not certainly, done the exact same thing themselves. Obviously it takes a certain amount of moral bankruptcy to work for a company that kills a half-million people every year, so unsurprisingly the entire organization is filled with individuals who have little to no regard for what they do to their fellow man....whether it be a co-worker or a consumer of their products.

Mon Jan 25 2016,N/A,,TSM ,Flexibility and Package,4,"Flexibility 
As a FSF employee, you can determine your schedule the majority of the time. If you are a solid performer and achieve or exceed the business goals, you have quite a bit of autonomy. A recent campaign ""Own Your Business"" is all about giving the FSF the flexibility to determine how best execute programs. Yes, some days are routine and you work with mgmt one day a month, but the other 19 days are yours. Planning is crucial so Work Smart--Play More!

Package:
While the base salary is fair; its all the benefits that really make the compensation worthwhile. 10% of your base pay dumped into your 401K--no employee contribution required (was 15%) FREE company car, 3 to 6 weeks paid vacation + 14 paid holidays, majority of your internet, cell home office covered, flex Fridays and fairly decent health care for a large corporation. Annual bonus is a little skewed, but depending on level, you can earn an additional 10% to 18% of base pay in form of a bonus.
","Cons:
1)You MUST love Richmond VA if you're interested in HQ--think brand, mgmt, HR, IS/IT etc.
2) If you want to stay in sales/FSF--you better be ready to move. The more open to relocation, the better your odds are of being promoted. That's the Achilles' heal--no fault, just expect to stay in your position/pay grade, unless you 'hit up' Richmond or move around. That is a personal decision.
Advice to Management
HQ:
Sometimes we wonder about HQ--does PMUSA ever talk with UST or JMC or NuMark. Yes, Altria looks at them as separate companies, but there are still just 24hrs in a day and 20 days in a cycle. We're just one FSF person now talking for four different Opcos. 
FSF:
Sometimes the timing and launch of products and programs just does not make sense. If that ""ITEM"" is so darn important, then give it the dedicated time to have it properly sold in and executed at retail. No just flung up. Recall; MarkTen 1.5/2.5 launch in Q4 '14, UST hex trays & SPPs. 
Technology:
Mr. Marty--IS/IT/BP&T really needs $$$$$. Please INVEST some of Altria's wonderful margins into technology. Altria is behind and drastically losing each year. 
Advice:
Momma always said, ""Never put all your eggs in one basket."" Well, outside Marlboro where are those other baskets? UST, JMC, NuMark---need more revenue/volume to offset future volume decline in smokeable segment. 
RAI--their investor's report was really telling--Newport, American Spirit, Snus, Vuse, Grizzly--a bit more attention to your competitor. Perhaps we could learn something, esp. in the emerging categories. (think Marlboro can and paper Snus........delisted)

I never met a single person in the company I didn't like period. The saddest day of my professional life was when I had to leave the company.
","Work life balance is a little difficult, and only if your territory is an hour away from where you are based. The retention rate for living farther than 30 min commute away is much lower than living on top of the territory. If it's rural suck it up and live in the center of the territory to minimize daily commute. It's much easier to travel on the weekends twice a week rather than every single day to work.

There is no cost of living adjustment for people in major metropolitan areas 55k across the board, and average 7k bonus per annum. While my rent in a semi rural territory was $750 another of my training class lived in an affluent territory in Cali rent was $1800 (that's a whole 2wks paycheck post-tax).

Lots of boxes, no joke I knew the UPS guy, and his family, and all the local freight companies by the time I left the company. Get a separate bedroom or rent a storage unit.

Sometimes lonely you won't see your team sometimes for three-four weeks.

Mon Mar 16 2015, Territory Sales Manager,"Detroit, MI",Current Employee ,Great place to launch your career.,7,"-Altria provided a great experience out of college to understand how businesses operate in the real world. As a TSM you are granted quite a bit of autonomy as you develop a soft skill and strategic thinking capabilities unmatched in other entry-level sales/marketing positions. 

-Driven-employees are given a variety experiences and plenty of internal recognition. If management likes you you will be constantly rewarded and praised for being part of the 'team.'

-The organization is large and has plenty of financial resources, which results in cushy corporate meetings, a brand new Chevy Traverse every 50k miles, free gas/car insurance, and a very nice work life balance. 

College Graduates: Great place to launch your career, not develop a career. My advice to any college graduate who accepts a TSM position is to work here for 3-4 years, develop a nice skill set, study hard for your GMAT and get out of the company while you still have your personality/personal integrity intact.

Experienced Hires: Nice Benefits and Excellent Work Life Balance. Not a bad place to spend a career if you are content with living a comfortable/modest lifestyle.
","-Your professional trajectory and experience is determined by the management you fall under. Constant company realignments and downsizing leads to a management musical chairs which is horrible for those seeking advancement.

-Your direct managers (Unit Managers) are typically under-experienced 25-28 year-old 'yes-men/women.' If you are fortunate enough to work under an experienced Unit manager (5+ years in the job) your career will flourish, otherwise all I can tell you is good luck!

-Everyone hears how large organizations are full of politics and bureaucracy. This commonly held belief is because of firms like Altria. Yes-Men (and women) are the ones that you typically see advance in their career.
Advice to Management
Your advancement process is horrible! By turning employee advancement into a constant competition you risk ostersizing young talent and losing them to other organizations or business school. If Altria wants to retain and advance the 'best' talent it needs to figure this out.

Half of the managers are great and genuine leaders. The other half of the managers are unfortunately not qualified to be in their position they have, they are only there because they know how to put on a company face or fill a diversity quota.

-Company is constantly moving forward with what's trending in the market 
-You are also provided numerous helpful resources and tools to set you up for success. Altria is also very good at taking feedback so innovation is imbedded in its DNA. 
-You are in control of YOUR territory so you have a lot of responsibility and freedom to do what you will with it such as developing a territory plan to increase your client and company sales.
","-Promotion track changed where it is still too new to understand what the exact criteria/ process is to get promoted. Not much infrastructure around it besides 4 factors that they look at and management does not really check in or direct you on how to train against those competencies. It's more like you go and train yourself and prove to us that you complete each bucket and then we let you know if you can be promoted or not. If it is a no, then you will never be promoted. 

-Entry Level TSM does not lead or really work in a team. You are essentially by yourself 90% of the time so it can get lonely and leadership development activities are not there.

Tue Sep 23 2014, Senior Business Analyst,"Richmond, VA",Former Employee ,Excellent Pay with Outstanding Benefits (if you are willing to give up your personal and/or family life),4,"Excellent compensation and outstanding benefits with top notch facilities. The perks are simply out of this world from an in-house fully staff gym, to outstanding cafeterias and even am in-house doctor (that is not a typo) which you can use as your Primary Care Physician. The retirement and profit sharing plan too are simply out of this world and you would be hard pressed to find a company that still provides this level of rich benefits and compensation. Their Human Resources group is very competent and enjoys the support of ""an army of lawyers"". One can summarize how their HR group works as ""constantly striving to do the right thing"" while still remaining compliant with State and Federal laws. 

You will achieve a level of proficiency on what you do that will serve you well once/if you leave the company. Altria provides its employees with the best resources available. I almost forgot; their severance in the event you are let go due to reduction in headcounts (see cons bellow).
","The excellent compensation and benefits will probably be the two, if not the only, main reasons you will remain with the company. As a general rule there is absolutely no work-life balance whatsoever, even as management constantly reminds you that there is. With the exception of ""Sales"" and ""Research and Development"" departments it is unlikely you will ever reach the executive row unless you are a lawyer.

Most departments are obsessed with perfection which will be achieved at all costs and by all means necessary. Most employees have long tenures (25 to 30 years of employment is not at all uncommon) and not surprisingly many resist any type of change. Finding fault or ""something wrong"" in all of your work is somewhat of a sport practice by many of these tenured employees.

If you fall out of grace with management, even if it is completely unfair or uncalled for, they are experts at creating the documentation necessary to get you walk you out of the company. Restructuring occurs almost every year due to the nature of its declining business.
Advice to Management
Continue to provide the outstanding resources employees receive in order to complete their jobs, whatever it may be. The ""culture of compliance"" was one of things I was most proud of when I worked there. 

Work-Life balance, or lack there of, will continue to be a challenge for Altria. Every time there is a reduction in headcount the work that those individuals were doing fold over to those left behind and thus the workload continues to increase on a regular basis. 

Pay close attention to what former employees have to say about why they left the company. I left due to ""restructuring"" which always present itself as a wonderful opportunity for managers to employees they may perceive as not meeting their standards. If after all these employees leave the company you are still essentially having the same problems, then perhaps the employees weren't the problem in the first place.

Sun Apr 27 2014, Territory Sales Manager,,Former Employee ,Easiest money I've ever made,7,"Gas, car, great 401K and autonomy to complete initiatives at your own pace. You don't quite sell anything...most contracts require retailers to buy the product, so it's a cake walk if you have a good territory. If you have a low income territory it can be a little more cumbersome but don't worry, your bonuses come from how well the section does, so even if you slack you can still get paid. You could honestly wake up at 9am, work in your territory between 10am-2pm, come home and do some ""admin"" work for an hour and that's your day...easy money. The pay is amazing for what we do...A-Maz-ing. If you're happy with doing the same thing everyday, putting up with the same, uneducated people (retailers) everyday, and don't mind selling a product that kills people this is THE job for you.
","Customers don't change. If you're not promoted, there's a 90% chance you'll see the same people every day of your life. Official job titles should be Merchandising Managers because you will change and hang more signs, and move more dusty tobacco products around than you'll actually do any hard selling. The people are great and the managers are mostly too young and/or too inexperienced. The bad thing about working in the tobacco industry is it's hard to get out. Altria pays you we'll because they know it's hard to hire and retain people in this industry. If you do try to leave, employers will not want to hire you because of the industry you came from...so sometimes you just get stuck, next thing you know it's been 10 years and you're done trying.

Wed Feb 26 2014, Territory Sales Manager,,Current Employee ,Safe and easy,3,"Very steady and consistent pay structure. Most entry level sales jobs have a lower base but make up for it by providing commission incentives. Not the case at Altria. Incentive Compensation is pooled and averaged based on how you, your unit, district and section perform. This can be good or bad depending on the performance of your peers. 

Management is very supportive and wants the best for reps. Work life balance is excellent. Many reviews on here make claims to the contrary but I can't imagine an organization that has better flexibility and perks. Summer Fridays allow reps to leave early every other friday. Management is willing to let you take ""admin"" days as long as you notify your manager in advance.
","Unlike most sales jobs in the sense that you have very little motivation to sell. This is a ""sales"" job but you could go months without selling a single thing depending on the amount of time between new brand launch's. The job is almost exclusively focused around account management. TSM's can be successful simply by being friendly and making sure accounts know what current buydown and promotions they should be running. All these things may not sound like negatives to some because it's about as low pressure an environment you will find in any sales organization. The reason I list these as cons is because it's very easy to become complacent in this role. Selling an additional $50,000 of revenue in a month will not earn you a penny more than your peers. And lastly, the corporate structure only allows for a very linear career path. If you want to advance with Altria your Unit Manager, District Manager and Section Sales Director had better like you a lot. Promotions have very little to do with ability to sell or proficiency in your current role.

","Lots. First and foremost you spend all day in gas stations which gets really old, fast. Hardly ever see peers or manager (once a month max). Have to deal with retailers who can be uneducated, sexist, and crude. Management makes the job out to be something it absolutely is not, and any time you work with them you have to put on dog and pony show. You have very little control over business results but are still held accountable. Ultimately this job just became incredibly boring, mundane, and not challenging. That on top of having the stigma of working for a tobacco company. Your manager has a lot to do with your success- if you get a lazy manager you'll be stuck.

Company vehicle. 
401K contribution is better than most companies.
","Only stay for 2 years if you plan to have a career outside of tobacco. It is a great job starting out of college, however if you don't want to be in tobacco for your entire career you will need to make the switch quickly. Otherwise, you will find yourself stuck. Starting pay vs. many of your former college grads will likely be higher and will bump up rather quickly, however the increases level out as you approach the median salary of the position. This is common in many large companies. It also may be more difficult to switch to another true sales position in a different industry since the tobacco industry is really already established, a declining industry & the products are addictive. Consider how a future employer might feel about this.

Truly, most of the work as a territory ""sales"" manager is really about merchandising or placing advertising- just ask any rep how many boxes of advertising material the receive on a monthly basis. The company attempts, I believe in good faith, to arm reps with industry knowledge which is really quite good, however many of your accounts have little interest in a category that is declining or in some cases simply don't understand (for a number of reasons) the information you present to them.

Healthcare benefits changed several years ago and now costs employees more. And while the 401K is a ""pro"", last year employees saw a 30% reduction in the company contribution. All this adds up to an overall reduction in pay in a controversial and declining industry . The bonus, a ""group bonus"", is paid once a year and is largely based upon market share which is subject to external market conditions. These market conditions are often grossly out of the control of the employee group striving to reach the established targets.

As been posted by others, advancement with the company is contingent upon your mobility across the country and better suited for individuals with fewer ""restrictions"" and less to do with experience, knowledge or know-how. Furthermore, recruitment and advancing individuals from ""focus"" colleges benefits management financially.

This is a great place for a recent college graduate to begin a career. Altria looks for smart and outgoing people for their sales force.
","Mobility is must if you wish to advance within the sales force. Corporate HQ is in Richmond, VA (not the most appealing city). A Territory Sales Manager role positions you for little more than sales if you are unhappy with Altria. Other functional experience is necessary to move to another company or to seek a job that is not sales-related. Additionally, multiple initiatives are the norm. There is a lot of pressure to make numbers and balance multiple priorities all the time. Also, management wants TSMs to be strategic, but much of the job is tactical/executional in detail. Management should have more faith in the strategic thinking capabilities of their TSMs.

If you are not promoted within 5 years, pursue an MBA. Also, make sure you are organized. Otherwise, the job can be very stressful.

","This is NOT professional sales!! If you do not want to be a merchandiser to not apply for this position!!! You will be working with over 100 retailers going around and putting up POS (point of sale...signage), merchandising products on fixtures for top space and new products, repricing signage, looking at sales data to increase market share(yet you dont control pricing, distribution from manufacturer, advertising budget, etc.), and ""selling"" in new product (really just suggesting it and maybe placing an ""e-order"" for a couple of cartons of cigs..which RARELY per ""sale""/retailer is over $200 total of merchandise). The vast amount of your time will not be selling anything. The company says they are trying to go to a ""consultant sales position,"" but you can't separate what you truly are and what the customer (retailer) sees you as..a merchandiser from the companies idea of ""sales."" The position once learned (for someone of average intelligence..about 2-5 months) can become very boring and for anyone with more than basic sales (ie: summer sales jobs at the mall and a basic understanding of financial/sales concepts) this position won't be fullfilling. To illustrate this isn't really a professional sales oreinted position...the company feels the most complex financial concept learned is calculating retailers profit margin, penny profit, and mark up. The income is majority base salary (95% of it) and making a decent sales income (over $60k) will require you to move into management (generally at least a minimum of 2 years into your career). Also you have little say where you will be relocated to once promoted. Another HUGE CON is the company hires a lot of kids straight from college and they get stars in their eyes based on position title and base income out the gate...and have little to no practical sales knowledge or ability..therefore they feel selling $150 of goods in a ""sale"" is setting the world on fire. People also get promoted WAY too fast and without any true management experience or knowledge. Promotion is based on being liked and having a cheerleader mentality, with sales goals being secondary. Everyone talks about getting promoted even at the first training meeting. While it is a good company with great benefits...for anyone with true sales ability or who wants their income/promotion somewhat dependent on their own abilities and merits...stay away.

-Approximately 18 paid vacation days not including around 6 company holidays

-Upper management is fairly in tune with how the sales force feels and is sympathetic to the amount of initiatives we have to deal with monthly, however, only minor changes have taken place.

-Upper management are extremely personable, knowledgable, and mostly come from the sales force which is nice to see.
","-Although you are a member of a team ""unit"" there is no feeling of teamwork or unity

-You will do 95% of your work independently with no direct contact from team members, or managers (This may be great if you have held a job for several years and have mastered time management but for an entry level position there is little to no guidance other than what comes down from HQ).

-Your manager will heavily dictate your success, which sounds obvious, but in theory one should be able to pay their own way based on how this system is structured. Because managers are constantly being promoted and shifted around it is difficult to build a relationship.

-They bait you with talks about promotions but constantly change career advancement opportunities.

-Company sells the idea of their high employee retention rate and small turnover percentages however in the past year they laid off 125 employees which created a 1984 type environment to work in.

-You are essentially crushed with initiatives which is normal of a sales organization of this size with so many operating companies, however, everyone is measured on their ability to ""sell in"" new products which can be extremely easy in some areas and extremely difficult in others. There is no balancing tool in place to accurately assess an employee's ability to sell. Your territory can make or break you.

FieldEdge will be one of the most costly mistakes of Altria's future (less lawsuits). This program should have been purchased from an outside CRM company. It is decades behind in its ability to track and record sales, customer information, and give the sales force what they need to sell your product. It may have saved some money in the beginning but considering all of the updates in less than 2 years, it is obvious FieldEdge is in trouble. Giving employees more technology to sell in addition to their laptops (tablets) is a mistake. Your sales force is aging and they can hardy use FieldEdge. You will just be placing already flawed software, into extraneous hardware, into the hands of a generation that has no interest in adapting to this type of technology.

I don't mean to rant because in all honesty, upper management are great, I think they just have a lot of ""Yes Men and Yes Women"" Unit Managers looking for a promotion and no one is telling them what is actually occurring in the store with our customers.

Thu Jan 24 2013, Senior Manager,"Richmond, VA",Former Employee ,Good Company with challenging products,0,"Good stock performance and great dividend. Good Company with many resources. Good benefits. Altria sells a legal and what some people view as a ""politically incorrect"" product, they are all about social responsibility by doing the right things in marketing, selling and communicating about tobacco and wine products. Great training in many functional areas. Fiscally responsible.
","General Comments - Altria is a top-notch company and requires the best, brightest and thick skinned to take on roles in their industry. Growing top line revenue comes from successfully increasing pricing with volumes remaining the same, selling more product and / or introducing new products. Lets' face it, tobacco (overall) is a declining industry, particularly here in the US. Cigarettes are their major source of revenue and income for Altria. While the company is most likely developing new products, these will not take the place (in revenues & income) anytime soon to offset the decline in cigarette volume. In order to increase top line revenue in the short term, the company needs to raise prices or price promote their products. Either of these negatively impacts the bottom line either by reducing volume or buying temporary share gains at a cost. To increase bottom line EPS, cost cutting is a major strategy which effects the pro mentioned above; Resources. Think of it this way, if you promote a 40 share brand vs. a smaller competitive brand with a 10 share, the 40 share brand needs to outspend the competition by 4 to 1 in that market place.

Just like anywhere (not just at Altria), depending on your direct reporting manager, they may have a tendency to have their favorite employee(s) and overlook their shortcomings. In some cases, need to be more politically astute vs. competent. Reflects in performance ratings, promotions and other internal career opportunities. 

Also, most employees with 20+ years experience won't take risks (rock the boat) to drive the business forward. They do what it takes to get by (no more) in fear of losing their job / pension. Again, not solely an Altria issue, rather a sign of the economic times.

Still have opportunity to consolidate positions and reduce headcount by eliminating non-essential work.. There is a considerable amount of ""busy"" type work and individuals trying to protect their jobs. There are several Managers and Directors rewarding these individuals. Employees are in fear of their jobs and will not take risks to move the business forward as in the past; even though Senior Management wants this to happen and encourages appropriate risk taking, some in middle management are fearful and discourage this behavior from employees.

2. experience - big projects, opportunity for impact
3. coworkers - there are some good people if you can figure out who to trust
","1. It is a bully and blame-filled atmosphere cloaked in values that only apply down the food chain, not up. Very political -- backbiting while smiling in your face. The Compliance department carries a big stick, with the current CEO comes out of Compliance. Can feel like they are the police.
2. Declining industry with 3 rounds of layoffs in 5 years. Future layoffs very possible in 2014/15. There is a sense of the inevitable and joking about golden handcuffs.
3. A narrow recruiting strategy that is limited to hiring very young, inexperienced college students (from 20 universities). They are hired as interns then ""converted"" to full time hires. These young people are pushed up the management ladder without sufficient training in how to manage people and the business -- trial by fire. Some make it, many don't. As a result, Altria is always hiring. If you are a University Hire, you have many automatic opportunities for exposure and advancement. If you are a seasoned professional there is no career advancement. People are blacklisted quickly when they decline to move or do not have the right image.
4. Throwing money at problems instead of getting to the root cause. Lots of money to be thrown around for consultants.
Advice to Management
1. Instead of making people second-rate ""experts"" by placing them in specialized jobs where they have no idea what they are doing, hire professionals with a track record of success in other companies.

- First week of training is excellent for getting your feet wet in brand management
- The employees, especially ABMs, are very willing to guide you if you ask for it
- Fast paced work environment
- Opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional partners and advertising agency
- Great workplace culture with highly competent and fun people
- Exposure to senior leadership several times during the summer

Cons

- Rarely given ""day-to-day"" tasks that give you a feel for what the Brand Analyst role is really like
- They give a housing stipend but it will not cover your total expenses and it is still difficult to find housing
- You will probably feel like a complete idiot at some point during the summer because you will make a mistake, but that comes with giving MBA-level projects to undergrads. Not a con as much as it is part of the learning process
- The most important factor in getting an offer is your manager. I was surprised by some the people who did (and did not) get offers.

","Senior management is crippled by ego. While they promote the company values well, values are not demonstrated from top level down. 

Sr Leaders are influenced by perceived performance. Many mid-level managers tailor annual objectives and successes of the deparmtent to ""building infrastructure"" (A phrase I became sick of). Funny, they would build infrastructure knowing that wouldn't work (get an excellent performance rating/raise) then the following year dismantle the same infrastructure (and get an excellent performance rating for doing so). What a game. This in itself drives a culture that has to constantly be implementing and changing . If you're one who doesn't, it is reflected in your review and career opportunity.

Common phrase heard...""We're a small legal firm with a big tobacco business."" This is true, every task is scrutinized well beyond being productive/beneficial. They constantly chase perfection....which is elusive. However, given the industry and deep pockets legal review and input is needed in some cases.

When the company made a plan to reduce head count in a logical and professional manner it would be best to follow it rather than just dump all the people at one time. Now the company is struggling with reduced headcount and increased workload on remaining people (who are still worried about losing their jobs). Even two years after the first layoffs most people are complaining that there is little direction and they do not know what they are supposed to be doing.

Sat Oct 20 2012,,,Current Employee ,Company in transition....outcome unknown,1,"The best thing about Altria is the people. Lots and lots of smart, hard working, wonderful people especially in Sales. Compensation and perks are really good for those straight out of college, but become more average as you move through the company. Benefits have been significantly scaled back in the last few years.
","There has been a cultural shift at Altria in the last 5 years or so. There is a turning of the guard as a wave of senior leadership retires and new leadership steps in. In the last year we have seen the retirement or the replacement of the CEO, the President of JMC, the President of UST, and several of the VPs. There is certainly a power struggle going on as people vie for promotions. This had led to the proliferation of yes-men to the point of becoming dangerous. People wait to see what their boss thinks before offering opinions so not to rock the boat. As a result, we have seen half baked plans come from senior leadership and programs that are revised or changed at a dizzying rate. Departments come up with innovative solutions, but the solutions are not built to work together. The end result is complicated programs that are difficult or impossible for the field sales force to execute.

One other big internal con- most of the people who work at Altria have worked there for their entire career. As a result there is a homogenous way of thinking bred into employees that is never questioned. Altria very rarely will look outside itself for solutions...some negative fruit from this practice is the HORRIBLE technology that was created in house and the archaic process for advancement.

Externally you have to live with the stigma if working for a tobacco company. Also sales volume on cigarettes is in a free fall. The company has not found a way to make up that revenue. There was a 15% workforce layoff last year. This will happen again.
Advice to Management
Come out of your offices and interact with people besides the ones who report directly to you. You may find that you are being duped about ""successes."" Go out and work in the field without announcing that you are coming....you do realize that stores are cleaned up before you arrive...right?

Club mentality/Good Ole boy network for promotions (sales department) - some, not all employees from University Relations schools are fast tracked vs earning on merit because directors are measured on how many UR employees they advance

Company has a heavy focus on college recruiting without balancing experience hires. Most of the baby boomers have left the company so a lot experience has walked or is walking out the door. Very few people in the 15-20 year middle tenure left in the company. The company is not balancing youth with experience and this could lead to trouble down the road.

Advancement process has extremely heavy emphasis on creating a powerpoint presentation then delivering it in a story format. Advancement candidates literally stop doing their job or reduce job focus signifcantly to focus on their ""check-in"" presentation. The check-in is a good learning experience but the process is off point because it does not give nearly enough emphasis to a person's performance in their current job. A lot of the advancement decision is based on your check in presentation. When I ask other peers how they advanced in their companies, they say they did a good job and were recommended by their boss or saw an opening an posted for it. At Altria (sales department), advancing is a rite of passage.
Advice to Management
Balance experienced hires with youth

In the advancement process, place greater emphasis on job performance and less on the check-in presentation. Get customer input. Some people are pulling the wool over your eyes because they present well and are good at powerpoint but not good at doing their job.

You do a good job of spending on technology. Improve the training so you fully realize the benefits of the technology you have purchased. Overviews/presentations are not effective training. Employees still have to go back and ""figure out"" the technology. Training means trainer demonstrates and trainee demonstrates back so trainer can evaluate trainee's compentency.

During meetings, don't plan down time every night. Leave one night for employees to decide what they's like to do. Give them a $$$ limit they can expense for dinner on that night.

Wed Aug 31 2011,N/A,,Unit Manager ,"Great training, horrible advancement process",0,"I have worked for Altria since I was a sales intern following my junior year of college and feel that I have received second to none sales training throughout my career. The benefits are good (used to be great) and the pay is good (not great). Depending on where you work and who you work for, sales jobs are flexible and there is good work/life balance. The brand portfolio is strong, so you're generally operating as the #1 company (with the exception of the cigar category). There are a lot of great people here and for sales roles they only promote from within.
","Senior management seems to be very heavily dominated by a heterogeneous group of men with giant egos. Although there are a few true leaders in the bunch, it seems like the men (and I say men because there are pathetically few women in leadership roles here) they have advanced in recent years were selected for their ability to agree with everyone else in senior management but are lacking in intelligence or true leadership skills. The advancement process is ridiculous (which is likely why there are so few women in positions of leadership). If you are unwilling or unable to move wherever the company wants, whenever they want you to, you aren't even considered for advancement. The senior team all like to brag that they've lived in 12 different states in 7 years, but it's not a lifestyle that's conducive to having a stable home life or a family (although I doubt they're interested in advancing people that want this anyway). They really just want to be able to move sales employees around like chess pieces, wherever it's convenient for them. There have been a lot of growing pains in the last few years with the acquisition of US Smokeless and John Middleton, and senior management has been extremely slow to react. For the last year and a half, my direct reports have been constantly bombarded with focus groups and surveys regarding things that get in the way of doing their jobs, but nothing has changed. It's almost become a joke to them because they just keep repeating the same things over and over and giving suggestions (which senior management is so enthusiastic about), but we can't understand why we're STILL talking about it and nothing has been done.
Advice to Management

Early in my career, I had utmost respect and confidence for the senior team but it is becoming increasingly difficult to feel that way. What you are asking of employees (move all over the place, work ridiculous hours, live your life ""on campus"") means that you are losing out on really intelligent, hardworking people just because they don't want that lifestyle. You claim to be committed to diversity in the workplace, but the requirements you put on employees to advance automatically (maybe on purpose?) eliminate most women and minorities. There is a value in having different perspectives and backgrounds represented on the senior team rather than a bunch of ""mini-Craigs"" who are all just ego-maniacs.

Tue May 17 2011,N/A,,Territory Sales Manager ,Great job if in the right territory,0,"The best reasons to work at Altria as a TSM are by far the salary, benefits and vacation package. You are offered a competitive salary as well as a company vehicle and insurance. Also 3 weeks of vacation to begin but goes up from there. Also the company provided excellent training for my position. I knew what I was doing out in the field and had learned the tools to succeed. Additionally the management I experienced was great. They did not micro-manage and only wanted to see you do well and do well for the company.
","The biggest downside of working at Altria is the relocation to advance in your career. If you plan on advancing in the Sales role then you better be willing to relocate. You cannot become a manager of the same territory or unit you have been promoted from and most times next level positions are limited in the area you would want to move. The promotion process can take a while if nothing opens up in the areas you request to be moved. Also your intitial assigned territory may not be in the best neighborhoods and the position may ask you to step out of your comfort zone to visit particular accounts. For example, you could be offered a position in NYC and come to find out its Harlem which is not so glamorous.

It is a well known Fortune 100 company where you can get great training and experience. Also, the pay isn't too shabby for a 23 year old either...honestly I can't say any of my friends were making 60k for a marketing/sales position besides me. Altria offers great pay for recent grads, good benefits (including a chevy traverse and they pay for gas, insurance, etc.), and the people I work with are great.
","The promotion track at Altria is horrible, it's extremely political and you will never get the city you actually want. This company will ship you off to the middle of nowhere (I know a 26 year old living in North Dakota) and expect you to waste the prime time of your life climbing the corporate ladder. This might not sound too bad but this job is lonely, there is no office to meet people, you are by yourself all day (expect when dealing with creepy store owners who try and hit on you), and maybe see your coworkers 1x a month, besides sitting and eating lunch in your car. I'm paying my dues and heading out... 

Also, they bombard you with work, it is unbelievable..

They rarely promote someone that was not hired from a recruiting school. 9 times out of 10, the person promoted had a territory that looked like crap and their retailers were glad to get rid of them in the hopes of getting a person with some sense of work ethics.
","Work life balance claims made by our company are just words for the shareholders. TSM's (that work) are in the field 40 plus hours, they come home to hours on the computer for emails, online training and next day planning. Management are always making promises to quite the masses in hope that the workers will forget due to a constant bombardment of daily, weekly and monthly tasks. The company has loaded so much crap for the TSM's to complete that the unit managers are left in shell shock for a minute or two when asked what is the focus.

There is no need for advice because Altria leaves in a bubble. They have drank up all of the corporate kool aid.
