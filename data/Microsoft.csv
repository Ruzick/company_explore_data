Mon Jan 28 2013,Anonymous,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee ,Thoughts after 10 years....,1792,"1. If you love tech, this is a great place. No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2. What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations. If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice.

3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.
","Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company. Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".
Advice to Management
I'll type it here - but I don't they are listening...
1. Help proven talent move laterally in the company for new opportunities.
2. Kill/evolve the stack rank. Here's basically how it's viewed:. 30% of the company gets 1s and 2s - and they are happy. 50% get 3s and that basically feels like getting a ""C"" in school. This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range. The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead. In summary, 70% of the company walk away from the review cycle feeling like crap. This is no good.

After 10 years, I'm leaving - it's just a matter of time until I find the right opportunity. I need to find a company spends 90% of it's time building technology experiences, as opposed to 90% of its time building PowerPoints. And I expect to refuse the exit interview - because if you really cared what I thought, you wouldn't ask me after I decided to leave.

Advice to Management
Management kind of depends, some software engineering managers are good some not so good. Anyone who's converted from an SE to a manager usually doesn't have a lot of skills transference. It's very easy to move around in the company though so if you're not happy with your current manager it's easy to find another team. Upper management is very good though. They care about employees, our impact on the world, and I have never met anyone at Microsoft ever even considering doing something unethical.

Great work life balance with leadership who truly care about their people as individuals. Leaders lead with empathy. Lot of upward mobility and opportunities for advancement.

","For being a top 4 tech company, pay is significantly lower than 4 closest competitors. Team dependant.. but management has a tendency to ignore large technical problems.. or under estimate complexity of projects leading to false starts and resets where we have to dig out of the hole we find ourselves in. Commonly, a virtual team prototypes with no domain knowledge, ships it, gets rewards, and hands off maintenance to the experts to fix. Maintaining team is expected to pull miracle fixes out but isn't rewarded proportional to the challenge. Horizontal hops are disproportionately rewarded vs. consistent top contributors.
Advice to Management
Be careful to avoid incentive structures that incentivize taking shortcuts to ship quickly. My observation has been we end up paying the cost in triplicate later down the line. This debt compounds into missed opportunities, poor user experience, and loss of talent. Consider offering other work locations. The coasts are terribly expensive and offer much lower quality of life that many talented ICs want, despite the extra pay.

","Politics. Once you become director your growth path changes entirely. It becomes a mission to find a sponsor, ""serve the coffee"" and not caring much about the results in the field. The only thing it matters is to keep your boss/skip/sponsor happy and make them look good, regardless of what the REAL result on the ground is.
It's all about making the stock price steady and growing. Any slow down creates automatic panic and an incredible amount of churn across so many people that is painful just to watch an army of folks to move for a powerpoint creation. 
Since the stock price is what matters, everything is short-term oriented. While google, amazon, salesforce and others are making long-term bets from a sales perspective, MSFT just wants to close the quarter in good shape.

Thu Nov 19 2020, Principal Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA",Former Employee ,A 12+ year Software Developers' thoughts,0,"Microsoft Brand. Even a remote villager on the other side of the world will know & respect you.

Good values they stand for. You will see some active ongoing work on BLM issue; you will see candid care & timely response for COVID etc. 

There are still some good engineers & managers left at Microsoft. 

Good Benefits.

No/very less bureaucracy - Directors/Partners will often chat with you and help you resolve technical stuff. Most of the Senior Management is technically Sound.
","Very poor rewards compared to similar roles in the industry. for ex: for Principal role competitors pay over 80%.

Many teams in Azure are stuck in REPETITIVE work like migrating from PAAS V1 infrastructure to the PAAS V2 infra, rotating Certificates etc. Very unproductive. Several quarters - teams would not deliver an ounce of actual Service features - but, just the technical debt. Leadership, higher up - lacked vision & failed to align this well back in 2012 - azure inception times and existing new developers are taking a hit because of that.

Poor tech Vision, atleast in Azure. 

Satya Nadella, the great visionary and exceptional leader - tells a lot of cool stuff - but the middle management doesn't seem to give a damn. Most of them have no idea what he is telling. They don't get time to follow him :). For ex: no/very few managers follows growth mindset or Leadership principles or hiring-in as an interviewing philosophy. They are good people. Just that, they are so worked up - that there won't be any time left to listen to these.

Most of the Teams across the company are moving to Services model. You will end up working 24/7; no family nights; no weekends - if you know stuff :).

Rewards and Compensation model - almost incentivizes people to not share information and work in isolation. This has a huge negative impact on the Culture. Culture in many teams is close to Toxic. 

Large delay between MS Polls. Or in general - data about how things are going or employee experience - is collected like - once in an Year! By the time the data is collected - most of the times - the problems faced become irrelevant.

Movement inside the company is not easy. Especially, Principal engineers have extra diversity based rules - which reduces the available options from an already reduced set.
Advice to Management
More education/alignment to Middle Management on Satya's vision/goodness.

Fair rewards policy to Senior/entry-Principal band. This layer is generally very dissatisfied and has very high attrition rate and very hard to replace. Even worse, they have followers.

Azure LT should consider Funding based on Proactive Vision - instead of being Reactive to Market. Things like ManagedIdentity, KeyVault, Unified RBAC across all azure services etc just came unacceptably late in the game for Azure - which are few examples of how funding based on Tech vision would have helped.

Advice to Management
A little less volatility when it comes to directives and priorities as a whole would actually make employees feel that the work they are doing is important, meaningful, and valuable.

There's nothing quite like pouring your blood, sweat, and tears into a project or a group stated goal to then have it suddenly changed with no clear justification or plan to come back and address the project that was put on pause. There was a lot of hype and buzz about the first thing we were working on and once getting by-in to arbitrarily change it without a good rational rather makes the first priority seem not so important and also calls into question if management really means what they say.

This constant culture of ""escalation"" creeps into everyone's work and it makes you start to question your teammates and coworkers as to the validity of that priority because every individual's work seems to be a top priority and that just can't be the case.

","Mid level management is really hit or miss. Many of them really aren’t people leaders. As long as they document pushing pointless metrics on reps they stay. Micromanagement to the max. If you’re a tenured sales rep you might struggle. Unfortunately, leadership recently stated they would be focusing solely on promoting/hiring people from specific minority groups. As a result, this will likely mean discrimination against others based on skin color.
Advice to Management
Taper the hyper focus on metrics down a bit. Your employees are getting burnt out in this WFH model. Focus on competence and equal opportunity, not making all things equitable. This is our workplace not our church. Please don’t preach to us about moral or societal obligations.

","- it takes at least a year to ""get Microsoft"". If you're a senior member joining from the outside, don't expect to make waves your first few months. Microsoft is very relationship based, and to build relationships takes time.
- Politics. It's everywhere and you can't avoid it. There's a lot of people waiting for their moment to shine, and will take credit any opportunity that they can for others work, just to justify their involvement.
- Too many meetings. It's actually a bit out of control. For every executive meeting, expect at least 4 prep meetings to get to that meeting.
- Diversity is also a con. Most senior tech leaders are men. The way of doing work is very aggressive, so the women that do make it that far are usually not very likeable.
- Re-orgs are constantly happening. In one year I had 6 managers. I get it, we have to change org structures constantly to keep up with market demands. But 6? really?
- Since the pandemic, I'm working constantly 12 hours a day. It's not sustainable.
Advice to Management
The commitment to diversity is good via lip service, but the general population is 50% female. Why are we so bad at helping women succeed? You won't publish the statistics of how many women are in tech roles, because it is bad. We see it, and that just adds insult to injury. Think of how that reflects back to your female leaders. We feel like there's a wall in technical career progression, and that honestly is holding people back from wanting to stay in a company that doesn't value our contribution.

","Microsoft's a fantastic place to work if you're raising a family or have been in the industry for a while, and it definitely shows. When HQ is in the suburbs and the workforce is older compared to the rest of big tech, the culture is less ""Silicon Valley"" and more ""comfy employer to work for the rest of your life"".

As much as Microsoft tries to position itself as working on ""sexy"" technology, the core business is B2B business systems, and unless you happen to be working on select teams like Xbox/Hololens/Azure, you'll most likely be working on technology that's been around for a long time and processes that are resistant to change. These systems are profitable & successful, without a doubt, but they're hard to get excited about on a daily basis.
