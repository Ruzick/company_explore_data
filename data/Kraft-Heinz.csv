","Long hours, you know when you go in but not when you go home, management have no clue on how to build teams, develop others, treat others and are extremely under qualified for positions. If you are not in the ""click"" you won't be promoted or treated fairly. Very stressful atmosphere and no communication on vision. Every area functions on it's own versus having a work flow. This causes weekend work, missed schedules, no time for maintenance, and brings down the morale that is already low! HR is hands off from every aspect. Quality ruins the plant by making decisions based on if they like you or not versus status of the product. The plant manager is well aware of the situation but ignores it all.

Advice to Management
I believe that all Team Leaders, Supervisors, and Managers need to go through extensive training on how to manage a team. They way they talk to people is worse than some talk to a stray animal. We are humans and we should be treated as such. Management lacks majority of the skills to actually be a manager like communication, leadership, when to be a follower, when to deescalate a confrontation, how to motivate and drive their employees to be their best, understanding, and etc.

It is very common to have someone new brought in and be less knowledgeable/effective than the person he or she is replacing, but many years older...I suspect this is b/c the people who are being brought in have stalled in their careers at their old companies...not exactly the type of talent you want to re-energize our company's turnaround! To that point, I have not seen an employee base been this marginalized in any of the previous companies I have worked at. There used to be clear career paths and room for growth in the company, but with all of the restructuring a significant # of employees were pushed laterally / demoted in responsibility with no upward mobility in sight. To cap it off, management consistently highlights ""Clear Career Paths"" in all of the transition meetings without actually mentioning any specifics...which always gets a good laugh in the side chats on Teams.

I have been working at Kraft Heinz Company full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Possibility to work with very smart an capable people. The learning platform is available to everybody and has a lot of current and updated content. It helped a lot during the pandemic. The purpose and mission of the company couldn't be more clear. Leadership recognizes the lessons learned from the past and is completely focused in the company culture transformation. The roadmap is clear.
Cons
Transforming the culture into a more collaborative one may take longer than expected. Work life balance can be improved while we work from home during the pandemic.

Sat Apr 11 2020, Group Lead,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Hard Pass,22,"- Great people from entry level to middle management.
- Challenging because there is almost zero guidance from upper management 
- Opportunity to advance faster than a normal company but this can also lead to under qualified in critical positions
","- Never a consistent direction. The company changes its whole approach 2-3 times a year and expects employees to redo work to fit the new need. 
- Lack of long term view. Always focused on just the year at hand and never the next year to 5 years.
- Upper Management pretends to know everything and sets strategies without talking to middle or more junior positions. Majority of upper management is new to the company so clearly they lack any sort of historical information.
- You are expected to work constantly. PTO at KHC stands of Part Time Off or that's how it feels. 
- Severely understaffed with extremely inexperienced workers. It is not uncommon for a buyer 1 year out of college to manage $200 million in spend annually. 
- All managers are working managers but given the lack of staffing there is very little time to train, coach and develop their team.
Advice to Management
Stop working in a silo and ask your employees their opinions before you make drastic moves. At least all the people to have a voice. Also, prioritize your staff over everything else. I cannot even count the number of times upper management skips meetings because something ""more important"" came up then when a project doesn't get executed its the teams fault for not executing something that upper management needed to sign off on. Lastly, stop treating people as though they are a commodity and are completely expendable, you haven't been able to hire and hold anyone for 5 years, fix it!

Opportunities for advancement as the organization tries to fill mid-level openings from within in an effort to slow turnover and promote meritocracy. Lean staffing creates the opportunity to learn a lot, to accomplish anything you must work beyond your job description, it may also mean working below your intellectual capacity simply because there is no one else.
","Growth targets are unrealistic in the cost cutting environment of Kraft Heinz. Too much time is spent answering why the targets aren't being achieved versus determining what is needed to achieve them. Little real progress is made, creating a pressure cooker environment and high turnover as talented people become discouraged, or are pushed out the door if their views do not align with the that of their manager/executives.

This is a pro, but because it is poorly managed and monitored, turns into a liability for the company and other employees.
","- Junior, inexperienced teams holding big titles and not really knowing what to do. Even the Brazilian senior management team is inexperienced with the complexity of the industry and business. C-level management group all worked together at a bankrupt, government owned railroad company in Brazil and think they can apply the same ""recipe"" into a much larger, more complex business in the most competitive market in the world - they are learning that they are wrong. 
- Human Resource globally and US is incompetent in hiring and retaining. The function is led by leaders with little experience in HR and extremely poor judgement. Their incompetence permeates the organization as they continue to promote and retain those similar to them in thinking and background. 
- Leaders spend lots of company resource in initiatives that last 3-6 months and then die away with the change of leadership or change of direction. Hard to look up to leaders with any credibility. No consistency. 
- Be wary when interviewing as the company hires irresponsibly: they like to ""bring in good people"" without the proper background for the role. Then offer no training or mentoring and quickly come to the conclusion ""the person is not good enough"". Don't expect a proper job description and proper internal communication, but do expect lots of internal competition, resulting in the same small group of ""trusted"" people being promoted and having more responsibilities.

Fri Dec 20 2019, Manager,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,"A Turnaround or Whatever it is, Things are Getting Better",2,"I believe you really need two separate reviews: 1) Kraft Heinz as a company and then 2) Your experience within your function. With that being said:

Kraft Heinz:
- We're experiencing the so called ""turn around"" at the moment and things are looking fairly optimistic. Leadership changes are encouraging and internal engagement is being taken very seriously compared to virtually nothing in the past when I was hired. Keep veering away from the 3G culture - it's a failed concept and holds a negative perception externally. 
- This is a mega food company - fifth largest in the world. It carries weight and you take pride seeing our brands all around in the world and in some 97% of households.
- Kraft Heinz is an incredibly diverse organization from Chicago to London, Melbourne to Shanghai, and everywhere in between. I appreciate this, and the Diversity & Inclusion efforts of this company are world-class. I've made friendship with colleagues from all around the world!

My Function:
- Amazing leadership and ability to grow if you prove yourself. Somewhat controversial in the company as a whole, but ""Meritocracy"" is actually taken seriously in my area of the business - in my view.
- You're told ""thank you"" by senior leaders - and more importantly they are accessible whenever you need them. Amazing for a Fortune 500 company.
- Compensation is very competitive and I'm proud to be paid not just market rate, but even a little higher compared to external peers.
","I believe you really need two separate reviews: 1) Kraft Heinz as a company and then 2) Your experience within your function. With that being said:

Kraft Heinz: 
- Sometimes it feels like a really new startup company, despite being 150 years old. Frustrating, but *sometimes* thrilling as you can sort of steer the ship however you believe is right for the business.
- Kraft Heinz is INCREDIBLY competitive. Seriously. I write this as a ""Con"" because it sometimes can get a little divisive as everyone is trying to climb towards the top or try and take credit for your idea - or even squash it outright.
- A perfect segway into this..... It is a super young company. No, really. Everywhere you look there's under 30 employees at every corner. While this isn't a full out ""Con"" I think it speaks to the gutting of senior/seasoned positions at the time of the merger in 2015, especially legacy Kraft folks from Chicago.
- I would only ""recommend to a friend"" if they're up for a big challenge. Be ready for a ""do WAY more with WAY less"" mentality and prep to work a few jobs just yourself. 
- 3G is the ""parent"" owner and you have to live with that. At the end of the day, it's not necessarily an American company, BUT I am inspired by the thousands of US jobs provided both corporate and across our plants - particularly in rural areas. At the end of the day, Kraft, Heinz, and many of our classic brands are still ""iconic American"" but the $$ goes to Brazilians.

- There's somewhat a lack of diversity, but it's being worked on and has been transparently addressed. 
- Always a shortage of funding which isn't the function's fault, but it inherently impacts all of us.
- Do more with less. That's the theme across the business everywhere you look. No pens, paper, anything. Your PC, desk, and self.

Kraft Heinz is an amazing organization, but let's continue trending away from the 3G culture and revert back to the cultures of legacy Kraft and Heinz -- the reason we are all here together today!

Fri Dec 06 2019, Territory Business Manager,"San Diego, CA",Former Employee ,Hot Mess at the moment,9,"This is a mixed review because I love the company and love the team. I had a great time while performing my job. Immediate team was great. They give you the sales tools you need to do your job and provide great support on those. They promote from within before looking outside. Benefits are good.
","No service level agreements in corporate so emails and requests can go unanswered for an eternity. No urgency. Leadership is confusing at best. I have seen them laying off good people while retaining others who didn't even know how to send an email when they were hired. Constant requiring training and quizzes on ethics. Huge splash across Laptop DO THE RIGHT THING.... Looks awesome at airports when on way to see customers. Looks the other way when it comes to bullying even though policy says they do not. Some managers have extremely low emotional IQ yet they are still promoted. Females are significantly underpaid. No raises for years. Change bonus criteria constantly mid-earning. No budget for office supplies or reimbursement for internet or utilities (they require you manage their frozen and refrigerated sample products) so you will be responsible for the cost of the electricity to support a freezer, or refrigerator or both. The worst communication from corporate that I have ever encountered in all the companies I have worked for. Be prepared to chase people around for answers. If in the field, you will have little no no way to understanding who is in what job responsibility at corporate. They have this system called Meritocracy which sounds good on paper, but has resulted in inexperienced people in charge of important functions failing the field because it appears they are training themselves on the job and don't know what they are truly doing. Be prepared for ZBB .. Zero Balance Budgeting.... no office supplies. You pay for your own...including printer ink. Be prepared for ridiculous amount of admin.
Advice to Management
Start considering what is best for the company instead of ""what makes the most sense""....which, in reality...doesn't, when it comes to common sense. Don't worry about saving that $7.00 a month on office supplies over capturing new business. Stop with so many ethics training quizzes. If you think they are dishonest, don't hire them. Let the sales team sell. Back off the administrative build up. Not only are they having to perform the task, they have to learn how to build these reports and presentations to the specific format you are requesting. There are many sales reps who are tech savvy disasters and spend a whole day melting down before they can even get the courage to attempt these reports. Please understand that these reports are most likely fiction as your Salesforce reporting is not always accurate. It often has disconnects within the accounting. If you want your customers to support KHC, do a better job supporting them. I would suggest better marketing research when coming up with new products. We sold our hearts out be saw them as the flops they were coming out of the gate. Get better programmers for Salesforce. There's a ton of repetitive required entries within each landing page. Overhaul the product lists and use standardized naming so people aren't having to take 5 to 20 minutes to find one product number. There are many gaping inefficiencies.

There are still great people here which is what has kept me here. Great brands as well.
","The SLT talks a big game regarding change and employee wellness but ultimately falls short. The expectations from a bonus perspective are unrealistic. 50% bonus targets, but what management doesn't tell you is that is multiplied by how the total company does, so i have made 100% of my personal bonus, which will be multiplied by a 30% and ultimate will get a regular sized bonus. The workload expected does not warrant average bonuses. Employees are shamed if they leave before 6pm. Health and Wellness isn't actually a concern despite the weekly emails from HR reminding us to de-stress. What would help employees de-stress is a culture that discourages managers to cancel employees Dr appts, workout classes, put on 7am regular meetings.
Advice to Management
Stop talking about change and actually do it before everyone quits. We have a 15% retention issue which is higher than the industry average for a reason. No one is happy with the current culture.

","Money hungry. They’re always cutting costs. Only allowed 5 boxes a paper a month for an entire plant. 
Poor leadership. Company leaders are out of touch with what it takes to run a factory. More concerned with zero budget billing than actually producing quality product. 
High turnover rate. Corporate office is always moving people around, new hires are typically right out of college and you have to start projects over. 
Everything is outsourced. From HR to production planning, to truck assignments, everything is outsourced through India or contractors to cut costs. They fired an entire department and had them rehired at the contractor for less pay, that’s how little they care for employees.

Certain groups or teams promote people very quickly, too quickly in some instances. Other group do not promote at all. No calibration of people on the same level across R&D. 
3G does not value knowledge retention or technical skill, they want work horses that complete projects quickly (with lots of mistakes). The entire specification system is flawed and it is relatively impossible to execute projects in a timely fashion correctly. 
They claim high bonus potential but salary is not comparable to industry if you do not receive your bonus. 
I have worked at this company for over three years and have never received a docking station or mouse, in order to get office supplies you have to run when you hear someone is fired or resigns.

","Let's be honest. Everyone is all about titles in R&D and some of the best developers have left to work at other companies where they'll be appreciated. Promote people to Manager and they walk around still with the stank look that they don't want to be there. Walk down the hall, people don't say hello but will send an email when they need you to do something for them. Hold a panel about careers and owning your career in the company and they chose leaders who don't know what their direct reports are doing and leaders who don't even speak to junior developers or new people when walking down the hall – talk about reasons why engagement is down and 2-3 developers are leaving each week. HR isn't the best at being supportive – you never see them when they are in the office and don't sit in on department meetings. It's not even worth driving to feel worthless and what you're doing doesn't matter. Some BUs promote developers straight out of school within the FIRST YEAR and they have NO EXPERIENCE and PROFESSIONALISM which reflects their managers. Try to move to a different function and bitter managers block you. People come in late and leave as soon as their managers who get in early leave. Managers have no professionalism – swearing in the office and talking about others out loud on conference calls or telling junior developers information they shouldn't. NO. CONFIDENTIALITY. NO. PROFESSIONALISM. No true timeline or model to promotions and a career @KHC. Actually offering folks more money and promotion when they give a two weeks notice. It's a sick feeling working somewhere for 8 hours with people who don't play as a team but only for themselves and that's across the board.

Work with a lot of very talented people that care about what they do. Compensation is good if you can hit your bonus target 100% which is rare.
","No onboarding, job training, or continued development. New hires are expected to jump in immediately without any provided tools, training, or equipment. Employees are often without basic equipment such as second monitors and docking stations that improve efficiency. Having a desk can be a privilege. Employees have gone weeks or even months without a dedicated work space. Forget about any work life balance as 11 & 12 hour days are the new norm. Too many meetings leave employees scrambling to catch up on actual “work” on the weekends. Leaving your desk for lunch is a luxury and only reserved for the occasional Friday or birthday celebration. High turnover results in inexperienced employees being promoted to managerial roles without proper training and brand strategies change every few months making it impossible to execute strong campaigns. Roles are often “downgraded” to cut costs leaving too much responsibility with inexperienced employees. No trust with cross-functional teams due to competing bonus targets, making it near impossible to work together to accomplish what is best for the business. There are constant “fire drills” that come up due to management’s lack of organization and delegation which make for a very high stress environment.

Kraft Heinz has a very young workforce and everyone I have met and worked with have been great. This company hires exceptional talent and genuine people.
","Kraft Heinz advertises meritocracy, but the opportunities to move across teams and to get promoted varies by team, manager, and HRBP. There is no consistency across what Kraft Heinz stands for. They do not treat all employees equally when it comes to their career growth.

HR processes are very slow. You will wait for your promotion or new role for months if you're just unlucky enough to be on a team or have an HRBP that is passive.

Base pay is still above average but lack of annual merit increase and lower (sometime no) bonus payout means total compensation lags industry
","Meritocracy is a code word for we promoted you because the person who had the position left the company. 

Really screwed up priorities. Salespeople spend 80% of their time on calls with finance. Headquarter teams prioritize ritual internal meetings (MPRs, etc) over work that supports our customers. Millions wasted on a retail sales team that occasionally gets displays in third tier accounts. Lots of pictures to make everyone feel good but not driving the business and most of open sales roles are to fill vacancies on this high turnover team.

Hiring people with no experience is a common con for many companies but it’s a common occurrence at KHC particularly for high profile headquarter jobs. We’re hiring smart people with promises of bonuses and rapid advancement. 

KHC and Wall Street have realized that our brands have lost $Bs due to lack of investment but the company is slow to realize the same could be said for the people. Morale and engagement are at an all time low and many senior managers lack experience to lead.

","If you work in a manufacturing facility you work 10-12 hours everyday, I've worked up to 16 hour days before. This includes Monday- Monday, that's right, often times 7 days a week. No compensation for working more hours, while your manager has every weekend off. 

They are an unethical company overall. They glorify people who do whatever it takes to get numbers. That means no regard for food safety, people, or giving your team the resources to get the job done. It is all about making cuts and never about seeing the bigger picture. When I started the stock was $82 per share and now it is $32.07, so none of these measures have been successful and they have not done anything to make the company culture better. 

Lastly, when I put my two weeks in they asked me not to come back and did not pay out my two weeks or my vacation time. I had already worked two days of that pay period.

Their 401K match is 100% to 2.5%, then they match 50% up to 6%, very low compared to all the other companies I interviewed with and then took a different job at. Health insurance is not great, and no employee perks.

Thu Jul 25 2019, Sales Associate,"Columbus, OH",Former Employee ,US In-Store Sales (ISP),14,"Great introductory job in CPG industry
","If you have worked in CPG before, don’t bother. They do everything backwards and lie about programming. Your boss will tell you that your store needs a second bacon rack bc it’s a corporate program. You ask to see the email/memo from the store’s corporate office so you can share with your store managers. Your manager says “I don’t have anything like that, just get it up bc that’s what our company wants”. They obviously lied about it and want to brag to their superiors about how they up-sold bacon racks.

There’s the ISPs which services the stores and there’s the customer team that works on programming. Both have different goals and the customer team exports a lot of their work on the ISPs. Then a couple of my fellow ISPs were reported to our managers claiming they weren’t executing, but in fact the ISPs WERE EXECUTING, provided photos and other evidence. The customer team was actively sabotaging the ISPs and nothing was done about it. Every time the customer team screws up (which is frequent), they’ll blame the ISPs and the ISP managers take the side of the customer team! 

Chicago US Sales people are a joke. You spend more time doing ice breakers and putting together cardboard displays than you learn about your benefits and other important issues when you’re on-boarding. “Just go to the website” is a very common term when you have any issues or “Just send a ticket”. IT will fix any insignificant problem you have, but don’t count on them addressing any major issues. The recruiters and KH HR BOTH told me during interviews that the bonus is supposed to be easy to achieve as an extra perk to retain top talent. Then the news came out about how KHC is being federally investigated for missing millions of dollars and all of a sudden, they changed our goals for our bonuses and surprise surprise they became much more difficult. One component was store performance, you could dominate a store but if no one buys your product you get penalized! They measure just about every goal via your iPad, but the programs they use are NOTORIOUS for not being accurate with out of date data/freezing up/not having any data at all/etc. With all those facts along with that 3G cuts everything it sees, it’s no secret that they actively work against you in regards to reaching your bonus.

Managers throughout the country, especially the Midwest are quitting, ISPs who are experienced sales professionals quit constantly bc they know more than their managers and the managers retaliate with busy work or they’ll “promote you” aka ship you off to another state/division of the company. Absolutely toxic environment, a bunch of yes people that think every idea is great with nobody questioning the questionable ideas out of fear of retaliation. Be careful of HR, there’s plenty of loyalty there and they’ll sell you out. 

Meritocracy is a HUGE MYTH! They promote boot lickers. A little over 40 of us on-boarded the same time and we’re all told we’d be in different positions 9-12 months IF we executed in our stores. We hit the ground running and killed it and NOTHING. They lied to fill out their sales force. It was “well you executed 95% and we are looking for 100%”, they nitpick to justify keeping you in sales. And they never mention that you’ll most likely have to relocate if you wanna move up. Over half of the 40+ ISPs have quit.

My manager had the nerve to say I was unprofessional bc I got upset with his lack of support, yet every ride with we had, he constantly would objectify women in my stores. 

If you’re fresh out of college, the comp package is great. 

If you’ve ever worked in CPG, keep looking, there’s so many better companies out there that know what they’re doing.

Here’s some other interesting info...
After I quit, it took them a week to send someone to pick up my car and of course they had the wrong car information. The guy who was picking it up was on a tight schedule to get home and he had to wait two hours for the issue to be corrected. I felt so sorry for the guy, but wasn’t surprised bc that’s KHC in a nutshell. They screw up with no accountability and the little people get screwed.

Also, I’ve been gone for several months now and I’m still receiving coupons and POS in the mail. This is supposed to be one of the largest food companies in the world and they DO NOT have their act together.

A lot of great benefits, 2 weeks vacations after your first month of being with the company. A lot of room for promotions!
","Seniority is an issue, they value how long you have been there more than actual performance. They have three different shifts, 1st shift being 7a-3:30, 2nd shift 3p-11:30p and 3rd shift 11p-7:30, to which they will stick you on a shift depending on when you were hired, not if you are good at your job or not. A lot of discrimination. The majority of individuals hired by Kraft in Garland are African Americans, management is mostly made up of White Americans, and they hire a bunch of Burmese Asians that don't speak English (which causes a lot of bottlenecks). It boils down to if the African Americans don't like you, they will call you a racist and go to HR with false information to purposely get you moved or fired. The people who can vouch for you don't ever get questioned or don't speak English, so HR automatically believes what they hear and give the liars what they want. I've even had a African American Line Lead tell me that I was received complains against, and then told me that they didn't want to work with me because of my Hispanic background and age, but never took the situation to HR. That same Lead also gets her ""favorites"" good high paying leadership positions and let's them sit in the coordinators office, sometimes even moving Team Leads from their designated shift (for example 2nd shift) and move them to 3rd shift without asking so her favorites can stay with her and she can protect them. New Plant Manager is extremely out of touch, even going as far as telling us to fire an entire line (40+ employees) instead of re-training.
Advice to Management
Don't be scared of the ""racist"" threats. Have a fly on the wall in each line, and you will see the amount of discrimination your people are going through.

This manager favors the males for some reason when the women work just as hard and maybe even more. Their tone of voice even changes when they talk to males.

Fri May 31 2019, Analyst,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Toxic Culture + Fake Positive Reviews from HR,28,"Job provides a salary and benefits, which is better than being unemployed (maybe)
","Kraft Heinz does not care about their people in the slightest. All of their mission/values are strictly just to have something posted on the website and something to share with stockholders. They are not adhered to whatsoever. Each employee is just a number, and the company is way too cheap to care about the happiness/satisfaction of their employees. The company is way too focused on cost cutting and savings, at the expense of quality of both product and work environment which is a leading factor in the extremely high turnover rate. 

HR ignores serious concerns regarding employee safety because they are too busy trying to save money and meet their ""go get"" given to them by the ZBB team. 
Priority isn't actually given to internal employees for open positions, despite being told that they love to promote from within. HR/Recruiting is extremely unresponsive and comes across as very stuck up and rude. This is detrimental as Kraft does not do inflation based or merit based raises often if ever - the only way to get a raise is to get a promotion. This becomes extremely difficult when many positions are frozen/never filled due to budget.

The day I quit, I instantly felt so relieved. I would never recommend that anyone works here. The turnover rate is horrible, the pay seems great at first but unless if you're regularly being promoted (difficult in light of constant hiring freezes) you will never get a raise even if you overdeliver on your MBOs. This company will definitely not last if it continues on the way it has been going since the merger.

Also, don't be fooled by the bonus structure. It sounds great but is completely dependent on company performance. It's completely possible to get 100% on your MBOs and still receive a $0 bonus if the company multiplier isn't there. This didn't happen in 2019, but did in 2018 and probably will happen again given how tight money is at Kraft.
Advice to Management
Care about your employees. Stop being so cost cutting/savings focused because it's counterproductive and actually hurting numbers. You have to invest in both people and innovation. The 100M being spent investing in people in 2019 that was advertised never seemed to come through and it actually felt like the people numbers were cut in light of the slashed shares/SEC investigation.

Mon Feb 04 2019, Logistics Manager,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,A Poor Workaholic's Dream,36,"1. Extremely challenging environment - great minds to interact and work with
2. Give you ownership with your tasks and responsibilities
3. Performance and bonus is tied directly to P&L
4. Lots of opportunities to escalate career
5. Outside your comfort zone
","1. Poor resource allocation. Zero based budgeting done wrong. They'll give you the worst tools (laptops/ softwares) to do your task. An hour long task could take 5-6 hours since no serious planning has gone to it. Had to use my personal device. 
2. No matter where you fall in the employment scale, it's cut-throat, and you're looked upon as a COG and not a human. So there is very little investment on their end for your long term growth at least not for the first year or so. The company is run by finance brains (3G capital - go figure) therefore operations are run as a means to an end and not as a focus to be a well operating machine. They throw smart people at the problem and the smart people due to lack of time (short of resources) come up with short term solutions to fundamentally broken systems/ problems. At the end of the day, the focus isn't to have the healthiest product at the best price, it's to push out anything edible at the lowest cost. (compare KHC to Nestle, Unilever, or Kellogg). Long story short, the higher up you are the less job security you should expect - not because of performance, but because of they run the company based on delivering Quarterly numbers. Opposite of how Amazon runs it's business (its important to compare the two because they both claim to use Zero Based Accounting but the later actually knows how to leverage it).
Advice to Management
1. Invest intelligently on computational tools. You could actually leverage the time value of your employees.
2. Zero Based Budgeting is great, only if you know how to budget for operations. You're manufacturing facilities and warehousing is run so poorly that it's embarrassing to watch. Fundamentals to evaluate operations are Performance, Availability, and Quality. Budgeting based on last years financials (typical Wall Street move) doesn't get you lowered operating expenses. It creates loss in revenue caused by backlog. I understand being in the ring of fire constantly but its important to take a step back and evaluate a longer term solution. Roll out something like TPM across all factories and watch the company make a quantum leap in terms of sustained profitability. Then go after companies like Unilever. Randomly visit 4 of your factories and DCs and then do the same for Unilever in North America and you'll see what I am talking about. 
3. Please revisit all Demand Planners, check their performance in detail and see how far away from any logic or strategy is used to make predictions. It creates a ripple effect of poor decisions all the way up to customer delivery. Hate to say it, invest in machine learning (I think Genpact is the new supplier) and revisit the algorithms used in each categories. Before that recategorize products based on some consistent business logic rather than what sounds good or what Kraft and Heinz have done in the past. You can't blame category managers for their performance if you don't give them the tools to do a good job. It's not 2005, It's 2019, act accordingly. 
4. Revisit ALL distribution routes and hubs. There is money sitting on plane sight. 
5. Going back to it all - If you truly want to create the ""World's Best Food Company"" then you need to sacrifice a couple of quarters of managing ""Analyst's Expectations"" and mange your employee's needs, and your customers wants. Also the best food company sells the best food, not sugar and meat laced carcinogens that's impacting customers in a negative way - just a thought, might not be your strategy. Then change your mission statement to ""Be a company that delivers the best value food"". I expect more from Brazilians. 
6. You have everything in your power to turn this business around. Listen to what the employees are trying to say and leverage their talent effectively. This is not a burger king (another poorly run 3G business) or a retail or an alcoholic beverage company - please stop copy pasting business strategy across all business. If your focus is to produce food with inelastic demand - then good, stay there, but look into your OEE for manufacturing facilities and roll out an aggressive 3 year TPM plan Brazilian style instead of blindly chopping of unprofitable footprint - its unprofitable not due to demand but due to poor PCA (refer to fundamentals). Focus internally for at least 2 years before trying to acquire anything. Your competitors are selling the same economic good with a higher quality and with healthier alternatives. Cutting operational units, labor, to reduce your operating expense doesn't make anything better. Look at your inventory numbers/ ratios since the take over. Can't really hide behind those right? It would be great if you ran it like a company of people for people rather than a company of COGS for Market Share. You're blessed with talent and have great momentum going for you. Good luck!

Thu May 02 2019,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Not Everything is Fully Disclosed,0,"This is a company that bases bonuses and promotions based on merit. But, that strategy is fraught with challenges...
","...by promoting based on a single success versus a series of successes. I'm seeing this a lot in the Marketing and Supply Chain organization. Regardless of success, experience can only be gained by time. And, because of the meritocracy aspect, KHC pays a premium for less experience in Supply Chain and likely Marketing. These 20-somethings will not have many options elsewhere and will likely take pay cuts and title demotions--because a few wins does not translate into demonstration of consistent winning.

Merit increases is an expectation in the U.S. job market. Upon learning that a colleague has only received 1 merit increase in 4 years, I am incredibly disappointed that this was not fully disclosed. And, it's tremendously disrespectful to employees and runs counter to respecting the value of employees. Why does KHC think it's okay to raise prices on their products but not provide merit increases to their employees. This is one surefire way to reduce your employees ability to maintain their quality of life and yet expect them to promote the price increases. The 3G cost cutting method is a failure. If this company was realistic in their quest for success, every 3G employee should be removed and replaced with those who know what they're doing, understand the balance between cost and revenue, and truly want to see the company succeed.

","Every mechanical department is run by a good ol' boys club. The management team is too arrogant and lazy to actually lead, so they let the senior mechanics run the shows. Whatever makes it so senior management doesn't have to leave their offices. The senior mechanics are all close to retirement and just want to ride the sinking ship that is Kraft Heinz to the end with no worries. So, if you are just starting out with your career and need growth and development, you will not get it from them. If you ask management to help you, they will always side with the good ol' boys, especially if it means they don't actually have to work.

Everything is falling apart. Everything is broken. You will not be allowed to fix anything. You will spend your days as an HVAC mechanic reading books and pretending to look busy.

The culture here is extremely toxic. You will hate your job. You will hate the management. You will hate the Union. The only thing worth being here for is the people.

All this place is good for is to make your resume look good. By 2020, the place will close or be sold. Don't waste your time coming here in hopes of a career. The ol' boys will make sure you don't grow. Just use this place make money, suck out of it what you can and leave.

Wed Apr 17 2019,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,"Get in and get out (Beware ""Fake"" HR Postings)",25,"There is comradery is misery; your average employee is incredible. They're all supportive, take the time to listen, and really want the best for each other. There are some leaders in the company that are so easy to believe in and follow into the dark (Positive), but they all exist below what’s called the Zone Presidents level, and they're quickly leaving. Some of the BIGGEST stalwarts in the CPG industry (be it in Marketing, or Category Leadership, Sales, or otherwise) have been running for the exits. The plan isn't healthy, the innovation isn't innovation, and the people in charge mainly got there due to nepotism (no need to look further than Hees' resume and how he was connected to get to the roles he got to; his results speak for themselves and the results are terrible).
","BEWARE OF SOME OF THESE REVIEWS. EVEN I WAS ASKED BY HR TO WRITE A POSITIVE REVIEW TO INCREASE THE RATING OF THE COMPANY ON GLASSDOOR. JUST TAKE HEED WITH ALL REVIEWS

No amount of team comradery will get you through the company bureaucracy. The company likes to entice people to join by over-paying, but to get an advancement/promotion while in the company, they will undercut you as much as possible. In fact, it's in line with their Zero-Based Budgeting policies. For example, if there's an open role and as a hiring manager you have already identified the appropriate candidate to fill the role internally, we will not hire that person for a minimum 6 - 8 weeks to save on budget. In the grand scheme of things, is this really fair to the surrounding team that needs to pick up the slack? Does the savings really make a tangible difference?
Furthermore, there are teams that cook their numbers to seem more beneficial than the realized success actually is (ask them about ISP). 
And if that wasn't enough, I wish I could share some of the several videos where our CEO dodges questions about long term strategy, mainly because he is benchmarked historically on in-year results. Only for the first time ever are his goals overtly stated as more than one year long and that's this year (2019). It's a sad state of affairs. I'm not sure 3G was ready to put the ""good boys' club"" to bed [see: Hees', again].

I hope that some of these examples illuminate what it means to work at KraftHeinz and not the musings of a disgruntled employee. If I'm being honest, I've learned a lot in role, made some amazing friendships, and have recently been offered a promotion, that I will turn down because of some of the reasons I've listed above, all while in a hiring freeze. HOWEVER, the company is best to get on the resume, build as best you can while you're here, and then leave. There's a reason that in some groups, employee turnover is nearing 90% and that there are HR goals to retain employees (even unsatisfactory ones). Unfortunately for those in HR, they're hindered by policies that are unjust and they can't keep people even if they really wanted to. The biggest things the company can do right now to turn around, in my perspective (representative of many others), is to first put the 'human' back in Human Resources; I am a number to them. Literally. Second, they really need to take a look in the mirror around their strategy long-term. The current playbook is Acquire [a company], Gut [all costs], and repeat. Organic growth is not part of the strategy because investment is not part of the strategy. It's a travesty because I love so many of the brands. They've just made it near impossible to do business with, and for, them.

","Since Kraft Heinz merger this place went from being a good place to work down to something that will get you by but is horrible atmosphere. The people are great to work with but are getting tired of being stepped on, harassed and abused by management. Profess ""integrity"" ""quality"" ""meritocracy"". ALL CRAP. Several people put into lead positions are the type that either don't tell the whole truth/story or flat out lie about it. And several of the managers are to lazy to investigate the truth.

Because of this type of thing there is unbelievable turnover rate. The Maintenance dept. alone has at least 50% in just the last 2 years long. Watching as those that are left are working forced overtime at 700 or 800hrs a year. Absolutely crazy. Would think that turnover alone would raise a flag at corporate office but extremely obvious they don't care. Most of new hires are young inexperienced people with no experience so when call for maintenance or help, not always getting qualified people to fix our machines. A lot of entry level kids with little to no experience.

Huge culture of manage by fear, threats, disciplinary write ups. Had Supervisor even say ""We have walked people out for violations and will do it again"". BUT they never talk/say anything, just walk in and say you violated this or that and walk you out. Very little investigation into the truth of what happened.

Some people got walked out for policy violations while others aren't. Very inconsistent management even on policy issues that are very clear. Over few years time people walked out for falsifying record and safety issue. But recently person suspended for safety issue but returned to work while others in past were zero tolerance Another example of inconsistent policy application.

you are a super stellar tolerant employee if you can make it 2 years at this place.

- Employees are provided with the absolute minimum to do their jobs, even in corporate locations. Corporate employees were provided a laptop and literally nothing else, not even a separate keyboard and mouse to use at their workstations.

- Corporate offices are completely open in format, disallow more than three personal items in your space at any given time, and can get decidedly noisy.

-Risk-taking encouraged
-Strong Teamwork and Talent
-Diversity of experiences for growth and development
-Flat organization culture
-Individuals can have an impact

I have been with multiple versions of ""Kraft"" over the past 10+ years. In that time, I have seen a number of models and leaders come through, and the truth is - there are pros and cons to every approach. Basically what you have seen in the most recent iteration of the Kraft journey is a full scale commitment to stripping away the glut of resources that existed (some of which were excess, some were not) to 1. Disrupt the way the company operates and better align to the fast-changing consumer, 2. Challenge our teams to think differently and question the norms of operating, and 3. Force a bottoms-up approach to renovating current businesses and building new businesses for the long term. 

If you ask me, that type of disruption was needed. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the stability, security, and structure of ""old"" Kraft models. The problem is and was that it was just too darn difficult to get things done and Kraft was no longer able to effectively keep up with consumer demands. ""Change is the only constant"" has long been a quote used at Kraft. This is the first time we have seen full scale commitment to answering that challenge.
","-Evolving structure
-Change is the constant
-Aggressive goals

KHC does operate like a new company trying to find itself. Employees need to proactively participate in the build and not expect the company to just lay out the steps/path for them. If looking for a highly structured environment, it may not be the right fit. If looking for real ownership, big challenges, and never being bored, KHC fits that build.

It is hard work. Hard work is also the most rewarding work.
Advice to Management
Continue to encourage the pursuit of big ideas and flat organizational culture, empower employees to have the impact they can have while supporting their execution, and celebrate the risk-taking.

In the near term, we do need a level of realism about what it is we can achieve while we build for the future. As I have heard management say many times, we are in this for the long game, so we cannot lose sight of that and drive our people too hard trying to achieve the smaller near term goals.

","Daily deadlines make working 10-12 hour days the norm. This makes it a challenging environment for mothers/parents in particular, who are often forced to choose between seeing their children, and the crushing demands of the job. When we say ‘this culture isn’t for everyone,’ for some it might be the difference between working an 8 hour day or a 12 hour day. You’re right, if you don’t want to work hard, get out, we’re not for you. For others, it means having to choose between work and baby on a daily basis. And being a parent doesn’t end with maternity leave. It’s doable for many parents though with flexibility. If we want to increase retention of parents, I would love to see job share or other flex opportunities. Opportunity to be on a different track for a given period of your career, without feeling you have to quit to get the work/life balance you need. Even small gestures would be appreciated, like religiously sticking to core meeting hours of 9-5. Working parents can hop back online in evening to work, that’s how they make it work, but they want to get home to eat dinner with their family, maybe catch their child’s t-ball game. We can do better here in terms of flexibility and support of families without sacrificing productivity. Leaders set the tone. I’m excited to better understand Lisa’s focus in the coming months. We are counting on her, and are optimistic.

Fri Sep 14 2018, Senior Manager,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Don't be scared about bad reviews, the team can be very good",8,"1. I was scared before joining KHC reading all the bad reviews. It turned out that a lot of those negative reviews come from inability to adapt to the new world after the merger. If you're considering joining KHC, don't be intimidated about the negative reviews. Trust the energy you feel from the persons you meet. Again, each team is different. 
2. Work life balance is good. I never had insane hours or insane expectations.
3. ZBB is not as bad you might think. It's just watch and responsible about your spending. I won't say the company is cheap at all. It's quite fair.
4. Pay and compensation is good. Some people complains that you might not get your bonus if the company didn't hit target. It's true. But KHC's base pay alone is mid to above market price. You get fair base pay and have huge upside if you perform well. What's there to it to complain about?
5. This one is Your Miles May Vary. But my team is really good and caring and love to help each other out. My boss truely care about me and my growth and offer opportunities for me and my team to grow.
6. There is plenty of promotion opportunities or opportunities to grow into a different role
7. Great AON location and gorgeous view
8. Every week there is activities such as snack testing panel, chef demonstrations etc. quite fun
","1. KHC has no rehire policy. Once you're out of the door, you're out for good. This can hurt in long run.
2. There is no annual merit pay increase. If you don't get promoted, you compensation can stay the same for many years. Maybe that's why there are so many lateral moves?
3. Too many laterals moves that the owner of things constantly changes. This cause disruptions in day to day work.

Advice to Management
Instead of a goals based system for managers only, create a generalized goal system for operators and floor workers. Implement methods to track processes for their yields per shift to give operators more ownership and targets to achieve.

Use a more yield/quality driven system (i.e. increase the impact that scrap/product ratio has only OEE calculation) to stress the need to make good product instead of trying to maintain uptime for product that meets minimal standards. Create a project approval system within ZBB structure so that a variety of managers can bring projects forward and provide cost-benefit data which will help streamline process improvements.

This can be both good and bad, but for those people who work hard and seek to excel, the rewards are better than what most companies in this industry offer. Starting salaries are extremely competitive, and bonus targets for most individuals are higher than any other company I've seen. The key is that KHC tries to tie pay to performance as much as possible. From a positive standpoint, this provides great incentive for employees to work on their goals (called MBO's.) I work in Chicago and the office there is great- tremendous views from the 76th floor of the Aon center. The people I've worked with are smart, capable and usually have your best interest in mind. I've been out of college for 3 years and have had good experiences in my short-tenure here.
","Kraft Heinz gets a bad rap for being cut-throat and ill-hearted, and although I think this is over-stated somewhat and that the overarching goals of their processes come from a good place, this can at times feel true. There's a much greater focus on results rather than the work involved to get those results (again, meritocracy is king) and many individuals I've worked with have quit due to intense work hours and sky-high expectations put on them. I've been lucky in that my team has not exhibited these traits, but I can say that others have not been as fortunate.

The only thing managers and others care about is $$$ - the experience honestly reminded me of my business ethics courses. Remember studying companies where you had to ask how does this happen?

It’s a mindset of continuous improvement and delivery of results. It’s an environment that rewards people for their performance, so individuals can grow at their own pace - Meritocracy!

Wed Jun 13 2018, Senior Financial Analyst,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Worst place I've ever worked,32,"Kraft Heinz generally offers pretty competitive salaries relative to industry averages. Also, if you're motivated to move up or become an executive, then Kraft does promote within on merit.
","Kraft Heinz cares very little about their employees. Let's start with the fact that on my first day, I had to scrounge around for pens and notepads for a meeting because they ""only ordered office supplies twice a year and were looking to reduce costs"".

They also implemented a clean desk policy where only two personal items are allowed, and desks shouldn't have much paper and clutter because ""clean desks increase employee productivity"". The CEO Bernardo Hees even proceeded to walk around the Chicago office leaving post-it notes on desks that weren't in compliance. Does this sound like a company / CEO that you want to work for?

Requests for help and/or supplies are almost always met with replies along the lines of ""make do with what you have"" and ""employees should go above and beyond for the company because you should act like it's your own company"". Management does little to help and often reneges on promises.

Wed May 16 2018, In Store Sales Partner,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,A Real Review from a Current Employee,0,"There are many pros to working for Kraft Heinz but I will only list the most important ones. 

1. Upward Mobility. Kraft Heinz is all about meritocracy. It's riddled all over the company website and Head Quarters Office. They notice and reward hard work often, instead of promoting someone just for being in a position for a certain amount of time. I am guessing a lot of reviews written bashing management were upset about being passed up, but if you are not willing to work hard then this company is not right for you. 

2. Compensation and Benefits. Kraft Heinz gave me my first opportunity out of college for employment. I am compensated more than fairly, it consists of a base salary then quarterly bonuses in which you have to earn. The In Store Sales position comes with a company car and they pay for gas as well. They also have an incredible 401k plan and insurance plan as well, and everything is covered with you when you are on-boarded. 

3. Management. This may not be the case for everyone in my position, but my manager genuinely cares about me and my future with the company. He pushes me every day to be better and constantly teaches me new things about the industry and my position as he was a former ISP. We have quarterly appraisals in which we talk about my performance as well as where I see myself in the near future which I think is very important. 

Lastly, I would like to clarify that these are my honest opinions. I know many companies give a bonus or incentive for leaving reviews on this website in a positive light. This is not the case, I genuinely enjoy and am proud to work for Kraft Heinz.
","My only con would be that communication from the top down could be a little more clear. Things get skewed from time to time and information isn't as readily available as I would like it to be, but I also understand that's how this industry works.

Wed May 09 2018, Sales,"Rogers, AR",Current Employee ,Meritocracy and Ownership 24/7,2,"It certainly feels refreshing for a veteran of the Food industry to see how new management with fresh ideas and relentless focus on achieving a vision can drive significant profitable growth through bold decisions, rituals and routines and a firm belief that anyone that beats their objectives and is willing to go the extra mile can do almost anything and make it big in a $30 B iconic company. Watching myriads of young and not-so-young professionals eager to come to take opportunities to head big responsibilities and leave a positive mark is a breath of fresh air in an industry that has been challenged for years by slow growth and changing consumer preferences. Simplicity and discipline inspires those of us that have been a while around, and I can see other ""long tenures"" enjoying the ride as they embrace the culture. No doubt it is built for those that like to work hard and get rewarded accordingly. I am proof of what meritocracy and ownership mean: have been promoted twice in close to 3 yrs after the merger, doing very exciting and different stuff, adding a collection of new and rewarding experiences that have me at high adrenaline every day I come to office.
","Not for everyone. You have to be comfortable with empowering your people. Disciplined to achieve goals. Methodical to get things done. Coach once and again to both those those that are winning and those not making it, so that everyone has a true chance. You must be everyday fully invested, all hands on deck.

There seems to be a more concentrated effort to turn the culture around and promote more employee engagement.

Great company focus on short-term and long-term goals/plans.
","While advancement opportunities are great, leadership sometimes promotes those who don't have the skills to fulfill certain job requirements - talent (including internal talent) needs to be vetted more carefully and people shouldn't be promoted for the sake of being promoted.

Creating personal time boundaries isn't really encouraged.

Thu Apr 26 2018, Continuous Improvement Engineer,"Champaign, IL",Current Employee ,Continuous Improvement Engineer,1,"A large food company with worldwide brands, Kraft Heinz looks to remain a large factor in US and global food markets. With such strong brands, Kraft Heinz is positioned to be a reliable employer for the foreseeable future.

My personal experience as a Continuous Improvement Engineer has been positive at the Champaign IL facility. My work actively helps improve the factories biggest issues, and there is positive engagement with floor employees. I take their biggest issues and help them come up with realistic, effective solutions. Helping making their lives easier is very rewarding, and many positive relationships are made between management and floor employees
","Working in a factory environment can be challenging at times as a liaison between floor employees and management. I am expected to work factory hours, including extra time before and after shift changes, and the occasional project will have me work on off shifts, which can disrupt work/life balance. Having to split the line between management and floor employees gives you great insight into what each side has for expectations, but always causes some tension, since both sides are not always right.

The ideas of meritocracy can be challenging at times, and can definitely be seen in the workplace, which can be frustrating when there is nothing you can do. I have encountered the pressure meritocracy applies to its workers, but I understand its benefits once results are delivered. I feel that this is healthy pressure that keeps people striving to improve, though it can be exhausting at times.
Advice to Management
More active engagement between higher seated management with floor employees. In my CI role, I am constantly working with both management and floor employees, and I understand both of their work environments. I feel there are many management employees that look at workers as numbers in a spreadsheet instead of actual people, and that disconnect makes employees feel that they are not being heard. A more active engagement and communication between both groups could work wonders on factory conditions and employee moral.

More honesty with the conditions the facility and employees face. Instead of only looking for and showing off what is going perfectly, telling the honest truth should be prioritized. I feel too often issues are masked to prevent criticism of work, instead of positive communication and discussion. Communication is one of the most important tools management can use to work with their employees, and when we lie about current situations and issues, we only hurt ourselves in the long run. Active communication and addressing current conditions and issues would work wonders on improving factory conditions

Meaningful investment into office culture and employee activities, as well as investment in charitable causes that employees bring forward. Lots of opportunity for advancement into any area of the company; you are not silo'd into one department. Kraft Heinz is not afraid to promote high achievers into bigger roles, so if you are a strong performer, you will advance. Every position has KPIs for meeting business objectives, so you will know your performance level and how you are impacting your team. Other Pros: Strong investment into training platform, with both internal and external resources. High compensation at all levels, family friendly and generous benefits offerings, with many options to choose from. Outstanding 401k match. Lastly, the Kraft Heinz culture is all about being efficient: focus on finding root causes of problems and address them, invest dollars for maximum impact, don't waste energy on tasks that don't add value, find a better way to get the job done. You are truly given the opportunity to own your job and deliver results, and your team is counting on you to do so.
","Like any large company, there are internal communications issues between divisions that need addressing. (There are ongoing efforts from management to address these). Sometimes, longer hours are required depending on assignments or tasks that are coming due. Some inexperience in roles can cause internal frustration, so communication and teamwork are key as employees work together to tackle larger objectives. Kraft Heinz may not be the right fit for those looking for a job where they can float by and punch a clock, but if you driven, confident in your abilities, and appreciate working with a team to achieve a shared vision, it's a great fit.

Tue May 01 2018, Scientist,"Glenview, IL",Current Employee ,Company culture is sinking the ship.,23,"Kraft Heinz is a good place to cut your teeth if you're young. You can get some experience and if you're really ambitious you may be able to advance even without an advanced degree.

PTO is all lumped in, no sick days, just 18 PTO days and 12 or so company holidays.

Work Life balance is worsening, but isn't too bad at this location yet.
","Morale is very low, turnover is very high. Advancement appears to be more about luck than anything. There are no cost of living raises, merit raises are few and far between and often end up not being about merit but trying to stop people from leaving the company. While the bonus target is generous, you may meet or exceed your goals and get nothing. Promotion in place is almost non-existent; you have to make several lateral moves before you can advance.

Training is non-existent and company does not appear to value advanced degrees. There are BS, MS, and PhDs in the same salary bands with the same job titles. Everything is learned on the fly, most of the experts have left. Learning internal systems on the fly are one thing, but in R&D expertise should be better valued.

Leadership does not appear to be taking concerns over company culture seriously or are very slow to act. Despite 2017 employee engagement survey, no plan has been rolled out. After bonuses weren't paid out, despite company netting $7 billion due to tax reform, at this location alone ~5-10 employees have quit per month.

Company has open office space and a clean desk policy limiting employees to 2 personal items. No office supplies are to be on your desk, but some desks don't even have drawers underneath them. It's almost a clear signal that you shouldn't make yourself at home; you won't be here long.

Company is extremely cost conscious which often presents lots of hurdles in the way of getting things done. Accounts Payable often struggles to pay clients on time which has strained relationships with vendors already frustrated by length terms of payment. This has caused vendors to put holds on our account and makes work very difficult for those in the trenches.

Company appears to be struggling to grow as seems to be the trend with 3G backed companies thus fueling constant speculation of a merger or acquisition and subsequent layoffs. Leadership appears to dismiss these concerns, but their responses are inadequately soothing.

If one of management's goals for 2018 is ""to do a better job on Employee Turnover"" they should consider not cheating their employees out of yearly bonuses. It is extremely difficult to get the most out of a team when they realize that their 50-60 hour work weeks and 100% personal goal achievements, is all for nothing when no bonuses are paid out. It is also unfair to recruit employees with the lure of high bonus payouts, which is simply not true.

It is widely understood that the company had a tough year but employees who have lived up to their goals should not be cheated out of their well-deserved bonuses. Make MBO targets truly individual/team dependent.

Due to the company culture (young, lean, meritocratic) and to the rotational component of the Corporate Trainee program, you get exposure to almost every part of the business, and work in two completely different job functions, within the first 6 months alone. Movement between Finance and Marketing especially is quite common. Finally, most trainees see movement every ~3-9 months, and most of the time that movement is a promotion. This velocity of movement is unmatched at any firm of competing size & prestige, and feels more like a startup. However, unlike a startup, you get the resources and good name of a big company to back your risk-taking, learning, growth, and ownership.

- Open access to amazing people - each individual is driven and ambitious - we've all bought into this culture of quantified meritocracy. But collectively, the people at KHC are eager to help each other out, especially thanks to the open office culture (no cubicles! no specified hours! free reign & flexibility with where & how you spend your office time) and the constant movement of people to new functions and teams. Somehow, KHC manages to be the best of both worlds - provides a very collaborative and supportive community of peers, while also rewarding extreme individual ambition. 

- ZBB - exposure to ZBB looks great on your business resume, and it is an important efficiency mindset to apply to any business and to your life.

- Ownership and meritocracy. Your career growth here is (mostly) up to you*
","- Job flexibility also means job insecurity -- those who get the most out of KHC and move up the fastest are willing and eager to take every opportunity, but that often means common job & team changes, which isn't for everyone. Layoffs and pressure to perform can also be stressful. 

- Poor work-life balance for finance functions

- ZBB takes a toll on company morale - it's great that we save money from going to waste and see it pay out as higher bonuses, but paying for plastic forks during lunch and not having many company bonding events really sucks

- Minority representation in the company as a whole, but especially as you move up, is subpar, much like at many peer companies. 

- Career growth is best for Brazilians, then males, then Caucasians, with everyone else still able to grow quickly but clearly limited by their minority status... 

- The company is more focused on cost-cutting (which is a temporary way to improve returns) than innovation (which is the long-term vision needed to improve our viability in the market vs. competitors). Lack of real innovation is pretty standard at such large companies, though.

- The above mentioned short-term focus manifests because of the very young teams and high turnover -- there's no incentive for the long term, when your bonuses and performance are measured by monthly & quarterly & 1-year goals, and when you leave your current project / team / company in mere months / very few years. 

- The company seems pretty hit or miss. Those who are young, flexible, hungry, and willing to tough it out really come across amazing opportunities and unparalleled career growth vs. anywhere else you can kick start your career. But that's more due to the youth, inexperience, and lack of structure in the company, than it is due to actual development efforts or actual company growth. I would highly recommend any young person to come to KHC, but would not recommend to anyone to stay too long, for two reasons. One, the entire industry and this company too will probably struggle to keep up with changing food trends. Two, because of the stress on meritocracy, high turnover and young managers makes development and real leadership lacking.
Advice to Management
- Give real answers to difficult questions, i.e. ""lack of females in upper management"" --> HR spits back the typical PR phrase ""we are being thoughtful and taking action to combat this"" without quantifying how.

- More company events to create sense of community & joint culture, in addition to the purely individualistic ""meritocracy / ownership"" culture

- Work more cross-functionally to align incentives, and work to reduce communication frictions across the company

- Be more upfront, honest, transparent, and approachable with UR communications with university hires

- Train managers to be proper managers and team leads. Likewise, make sure the high velocity movement of people throughout the company does not wear down on team cohesion and efficiency.

Sun Dec 31 2017,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Started with high hopes, but was soon disappointed",47,"-There are some truly amazing people at Kraft Heinz who work hard and are friendly. Sadly they usually don’t seem to stick around since they don’t want to stay in such an unhappy, negative workplace. Most people are stressed and just trying to make it one year before leaving. You can browse LinkedIn and see for yourself how lots of people who work at Kraft only last a little over a year.

-Kraft has great name recognition and used to treat its employees well (just look at the glowing Kraft reviews on Glassdoor from before the Kraft Heinz merger!) so when I told people I worked at Kraft they were impressed, unless they knew how 3G companies run and then they would always ask me how I was handling the stress.

-When I decided to leave Kraft, their growing reputation as a stressful, unhappy place to work meant it was easy to explain why I was looking for a new job.
","When Kraft Heinz offered me a job they promised big, exciting, and difficult projects, motivated team members, and professional growth. Within weeks I realized everything they promised either had a dark underbelly or was a flat out lie.

-It feels like the biggest reason they have lots of opportunities for growth is that every few months they lay off a big group of people. This creates a tense environment because you’ll routinely see people pushed out. Even high performers can be laid off if they had the bad luck of being on a team Kraft no longer needs, unless they’re offered a transfer onto a team they have no interest in joining, maybe even in a totally different field.

-The Kraft Heinz recruiter convinced me to take a lower salary than I planned on accepting because she bragged how the bonus structure is amazing since we’re all owners here! It wasn’t until I started that I heard you only get the full bonus if you hit all your targets and also the company does well enough to approve paying out 100% of employees’ earned bonuses. I also heard later that recruiters’ bonuses depend in large part on filling roles really quickly, but not how long you actually stay at Kraft. This means it is really tempting for them to promise anything to get you accept, even if it’s an exaggeration and there’s a chance you’ll want to leave Kraft upon learning the truth.

-No matter why you leave Kraft, you can almost never be rehired again. They don’t care if you’re quitting because of a family move, a personal tragedy, or an amazing new job opening up elsewhere. They believe loyalty to Kraft is the most important thing so you should never have to leave. I see this as a sign of how they view employees’ personal lives.

-Kraft asks a lot from its employees and promises meritocracy in return. It is a lot like a big 10 school, really rah-rah, and it feels like a lot of employees come from work hard, party hard schools. But since the best opportunities seem to go to Brazilians first, then men and there are constant layoffs, people get discouraged fast.
Advice to Management
Any time somebody points out a problem at the company that’s linked to the culture, like the crazy work hours, stress that comes from constant layoffs, or how people routinely cry in the bathroom, it feels like HR just shrugs and says the problem is that the complainer isn’t burning with ambition. Kraft refuses to truly evaluate the long term sustainability of the way they work and treat employees. It feels like they are always doing employee satisfaction surveys because they know there’s a serious culture problem, but they refuse to acknowledge you just can’t ask employees to sacrifice so much health, time, and energy without creating a stressful and negative workplace.

Because my team was so difficult, the work/life balance was poor, and the overall work environment was unhappy I ended up finding a new job. When I told people at Kraft I was leaving I was shocked how many people said they were jealous I was going because they were also unhappy. Even people I thought loved Kraft said they wished they were also leaving. It reassured me that the problems I was having at Kraft weren’t just about me, but it’s also upsetting because it means there are huge problems that nobody feels comfortable talking about openly and these problems are just getting bigger and bigger. Those problems also mean Kraft is gaining a more public reputation as a rough place to work, meaning talented people are going to start avoiding Kraft. Kraft wants risk-takers who are looking for a challenge, but it feels we are rapidly approaching the point where smart, driven risk takers will see Kraft just offers too much instability to be worth it.

Some very knowledgable teammates.
PTO days.
","Where to begin.. 

Yesterday, January 3rd, the company sent an email out to all employees confirming that a majority will not receive a bonus for 2017. In my case, and a lot of people I've talked to since that email, I reached almost 100% of my MBO's (measuring stick that KraftHeinz uses for measuring your goals/targets which determines your bonus) and am receiving nothing. Yet, certain functions are receiving their bonus for having a ""remarkable year."" KraftHeinz constantly pushes Meritocracy to it's employees, ""the direct link between delivering results and earning rewards."" Well, the removal of bonuses proves that to be one huge lie.

Meeting MBO goals usually requires extremely long hours, which is common throughout the company. Management routinely asks for this, often creating tensions and stress about meeting deadlines which many times prove to be unimportant. The amount of 11+ hour days put in throughout 2017 to make sure my goals were met are countless. My team had no qualms putting the extra work in, but giving all of these hours meeting our team's goals and getting nothing in return due to some higher level screw up is unacceptable.

In that same email sent to employees yesterday, just after the quick 15 word sentence stating no bonuses will be given to most employees and after the 5 lessons to learn from in 2017 (#5 was: ""Do a better job on Employee Turnover....reducing turnover worldwide""), KraftHeinz lists exactly forty three bullet points of positive take aways from 2017. Forty three. I'm sure that will help impacted employees feel better.

Good luck improving turnover this year. Motivation is at an all time low.

I worked at Kraft Heinz Company full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Opportunities abound, if you're eager you can seek them out and succeed no problem. Now that Heinz is involved there is a culture of success driven by performance only which can challenge relationships, humanity and personal growth. Find a balance for you.
Cons
Performance = success however it is up to you to grow personally and professionally on your journey to success.

I worked at Kraft Heinz Company full-time
Pros
Iconic brands.
Pay is good, particularly the annual bonus - if you are able to hit the target.
Downtown Chicago location.
Cons
After the Kraft Heinz merger, the 3G management style made this a very different place to work than the one I originally joined. 
-There is a monthly grind that just never stops. You are expected to get everything done incredibly fast, no matter how short of notice you are given and regardless what you may have going on in your personal life. 
-Costs are being continually and aggressively stripped out of iconic food brands, regardless of how much it degrades the quality of these products. 
-It is a male dominated culture, particularly the higher you get in the company. If you are a Brazilian male, you have just punched your golden ticket to the top. If you are a female, they will happily take you as a work horse in a junior role for a few years - but you will hit a glass ceiling.
-The highly touted ""meritocracy"" is a joke. The turnover is so high at this company, either from frequent layoffs or from people quitting, that there is a constant stream of open roles. The solution is a combination of either piling more and more work on those who are left, (without any increase in pay,) or pushing really junior, inexperienced people into roles that that are not ready to handle, and calling it ""meritocracy."" 
-The company spends a lot of time and effort on some really bizarre things. (e.g. No more than 2 personal items on your desk. CEO and senior execs walking around to check how clean your desk area is, and placing red flags on untidy desks like a public shaming of some sort.)
Advice to Management
Focus on building leaders, and reward strong leadership - not just robots who can hit their MBO metrics. Leadership is not something that you will get with people who are fresh out of college, no matter how book smart they are. And diversify your middle and senior management. You need more women and non-Brazilian men in these roles.

Fri Aug 11 2017, In,"Northeast, NY",Former Employee ,In-Store Partner,18,"Dream come true, that is, until you get settled in.

Company car, insurance paid for, gas card - until they forgot to take the $73 per pay check out of your check and then take large lump sums out of your paycheck until they catch up for THEIR mistake. Gas card worked, then didn't work, then worked again. Fleet team can't get it together.

iPad - NEW TECHNOLOGY! Until the iPad decides to not work or their apps stop working or faulty information is sent to HQ and then you're made to look like you're not actually doing your job when you are.

AMAZING PTO! Great PTO until you realize the PTO is pro-rated and if you use more than the allotment, you owe them money (if you decide to part ways beforehand).

Work/Life Balance - OR SO THEY SAY. If you have a great boss who understands LIFE then you're fine. HQ expects you to be in your first store at 6:30 and finish 3-4 stores per day. If you don't hit all stores in 1 week, it's marked against you.

Great benefits - Hope you're not married or have kids.

","ant communication between management and lower level employees! Expect to have conference calls every day that take up your mornings, which, in turn, will make you miss time in your stores and then, will push back your entire day, the e-mails from the CRM team that completely take up your inbox, which will give you anxiety about your workday ahead of you, and the reports. WHO DOESN'T LOVE REPORTING? Constant reporting, because, this job is not ""sales,"" it's reporting and merchandising.

Sign on bonuses! Oh.. we're not supposed to talk about those. Most people got them, a lot didn't. I'm glad I didn't.

Phone allowance - $40 per paycheck. Company couldn't get the payment together. After 2 months, finally received the allowance.

Bonuses - Easy to achieve at first. Company realized this, then made the metrics harder and less obtainable, so they don't have to pay their employees.
Cons
Beat out of my bonus that I hustled to get.
Monthly meetings that ruin 1 Thursday a month for you. Have fun sitting in traffic.

Is there a ""check all"" box?

Advice to Management
Stop portraying this job as a sales job. It is analytical reporting. HIRE REPORTERS or merchandisers, not ""salespeople."" HQ can easily obtain this information at the drop of a hat, but they'll hire people, waste their time, and then wonder why we're unsatisfied with our jobs. If I wanted to be a merchandiser, I would've applied to a merchandising role. GET BETTER RECRUITERS, they're a bunch of liars. Stop saying there's advancement and meritocracy when hiring/promotions go to Brazilians and outside applicants. People who are working extremely hard for you, should be promoted. No one wants to waste their time doing your reports that someone in HQ could easily do. Lastly, from Chicago to the Northeast, there is a time difference. FYI when having conference calls at 5:30pm.

If you don't, you'll be looking for a new job soon once you see how this company operates.",22,"Great opportunities to advance within the company if you like working 60-70 hours a week for the privilege of being promoted to the captain of a sinking ship!
","Since 3G took over Kraft Foods (Kraft Heinz merger) things have gotten progressively worse. The new company claims to be based on meritocracy---but high performers are only rewarded with more work, sometimes as much as was previously handled by 3-4 people. You can't do the amount of workload being assigned without working 60-70 hour weeks. Don't ask to work from home---they are in the process of doing away with that---and being met with strong resistance from employees. Company is desperate to attract new talent because they have cut too deep and angered existing employees to the point that people are quitting left and right. An absolute mistake for anyone to consider working here. If you see any positive reviews, they are either planted by HR or from people that work offsite and buffered from the nonsense (not at Chicago or Pittsburgh HQ). Company imports supply chain workers on specialized visas from Europe and Brazil who have no identifiable special skills other than the ability break any and all established standards of workplace decorum. One even started commenting on the election on the day after Trump won loudly to other employees---hello?! Discussion of politics is not appropriate in the workplace. Also, to give another idea of the way they operate----the CEO and another senior executive took time out of their busy schedules to walk all 5 floors occupied by Kraft Heinz at the AON Center placing red flags on any desk of employees with more than two personal items on their desks.

Sun May 21 2017, Marketer,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Beware - Not as advertised,29,"The company owns many large and recognizable brands that you will likely have the opportunity to manage. Your friends and family will know what your brands.
","The company tends to say one thing but act in a much different way. 

Meritocracy is, as many other reviewers have noted, basically a sham. Those with great (green) MBO's are continually passed over for folks with poor results but are good networkers. While you'd think Meritocracy would mean that face-time and networking are less important at KHC, it's the exact opposite. You must network twice as hard and stay in the office twice as long because the people you are counting on to help you might be gone next week. Also, Brazilians clearly are favored. Constantly ""reassigned"" during shake-ups, never fired.

KHC is for ""Owners only""... well, except if you mean literal owners of the organization. Within a month of the merger, the employee stock purchase plan was cancelled. Hmm... so, not owners?

The huge focus on innovation is not true either. ""Big"" innovation wins include putting a food service mustard into the Heinz ketchup bottle. Don't expect something breakthrough anytime in the near future. There's simply no investment to make it happen.

Now about all that cost cutting allowing the organization to re-invest in brands... That's not really happening unless you count wasting money on Super Bowl commercials that have no payback. 

The biggest issue, however, is the lack of talent. The days of going to Kraft to earn your stripes is over. Talented marketers have either been let go or left willingly. You're left with a ton of Corporate Management Trainees that have been empowered to think their you know what doesn't stink but really have no idea what they are doing and, in many cases, treat their peers and cross functional teams like garbage. This is a ME culture, not a WE culture. 

If you want a title, if you want the (slim) chance to make a huge bonus, then maybe this is the place for you. I will say these CMT's are absolutely meant for this culture but in a lot of cases are not the cream of the crop in terms of peers. I've never had someone ten years my junior with no idea what they are doing talk as disrespectfully to me as they CMTs did.

","High turn around, low morale, no supervision, management is lost, no direction. Ever since Heinz took over this place has gone downhill. They cut, cut, cut to the bone, then wonder why there aren't enough people to run the place efficiently. Supervisors know little to nothing about the goings on out on the floor. They are constantly shuffled from shift to shift and are never engaged with their people. Lackadaisical attitude towards everything. ""I don't know how to do that, the next shift will get it, etc"" No ownership. If an operator makes a mistake or screws up they are disciplined with a swift and heavy hand. If you are anything above a floor operator you have a huge target on your back. You never know if your job will be eliminated from day to the next. One positive I guess is that when they eliminate jobs (which they do alot) the job goes away, not the employee. They just say you are doing this job now. Like it or leave basically. If you are not a machine operator and are close to retirement you might as well pack your bags because your going to be done soon. They cut out all OT but now can't sustain production because of lack of people. Temporary service provides (mostly) good employees but they make a fraction of what a full timer makes doing the same job.

","Where to start..this used to be a great company and had employees that felt like family. Upon my leaving everyone was at each others throats. Morale was down. Supervisors would not stand up for long term employees. Management only cares about getting their numbers out and NOT the quality of the product. I cannot for the life of me understand how a major food company would NOT want to care about the quality of their products. Union is a joke for hourly employees and they only fight for those they choose to fight for..after paying for Union dues for almost 20 years they did NOTHING for me when I seriously needed them. Daily scheduling is super hard on employees and scheduling and management do not care...you can be scheduled 8 hours but can get forced to work 12 and get threatened to work more or lose your job if you refuse. Seriously think the original owners of Heinz would be horrified to hear of all the negative things going on in a company they loved for so long. It has gotten run to the ground since the takeover from Warren Buffet and now with the merge with Kraft, I honestly do not know how the company in Muscatine is still open, especially after the gravy recall in 2016. My advice to people working there currently...do NOT be surprised when the place shuts down, due to the company's lack of wanting to spend money to fix machines that are older then dirt, poor judgement calls on quality of the product and several other issues I hope to god no one ever seriously gets poisoned or hurt by eating/using their products. I have so many stories I could tell about this company but I just don't have the time or room.

Take a look at ex employees that may try to come back..not everyone that left is a bad person..some got forced to leave through no choice of their own but the companies policies on medical leave and such. And long term employees that did one job 25+ years ago may not be able to do that same job today but are able to do other jobs and should NOT have to go to a doctor every year telling you that.

You will get a salary increase and a big new responsibility where you will need to again surpass your goals if you want to stay at least in your role.
","As the only way the meritocracy works is by having enough openings every year in the company. That means that for you, or someone else, to leave the company sooner or later so don't think this company as a long carrier focus. If you like stability no matter you are achieving your goals look for something else. If you have always over deliver and you think you like to work 12 hrs a day you will certainly get rewarded and compensated. Generally they let go the individuals who are more expensive and are not able to achieve their goals the first moment you are not able to deliver. There is no second opportunity as you have become a cost center and not a profit center. Every year the targets are higher as the company has already consumed all of the low hanging fruits and unless the investors buys another company the results you have to achieve are almost impossible so means you will have to leave the company very soon.

Cuts to the 401k so now they only get 100 percent match of the first 2 percent put in a employee can put in another 4 percent only getting 50 cent match on it per dollar so they can only in reality get 4 percent match all together now with the other 2 percent being matched after a year so you also lose out on all the interest that money would have made you through the year. The company does nothing for employees anymore as they are way overworked as when the economy had started to crash the company had done all types of job cuts to stay at float. Now since the merger they are still cutting to make it look like they are making money. As you always heard you can only squeeze a turnip so much till it bleeds. Well the employees unfortunately are giving a lot of blood these days. The company is taking so much away from the employees I doubt the employees will ever get a chance to retire. The employees are having to be on call for overtime 6 days a week without any incentives for being on call a rude awaking for the former Kraft employees that had at one time been like a family oriented company. Well so much for family now. Warren Buffett and the 3G get rich while they run the company and their employees into the ground. I guess History will repeat itself. I just hope they hurry up and sell the company and hopefully someone gets it that cares about their employees again before some consumer gets hurt from all the cuts that has affected the Quality of the product.

Rather than eliminating jobs and taking over new companies to make money, try to take the company you acquired and nourish and build it up.

They hired the best and brightest and were maniacally focused on financial growth.
","Due to the maniacal focus on finance and the bottom line, Kraft neglected the topline. They forgot that the key today in driving growth in CPG is bringing innovation. They did not understand what the word meant and in a world where ""cash is king"" (they literally made every employee go to a seminar with that title) there is no room for innovation to drive topline growth, as that pre-determines short term bottom line impact. They learned their lesson and now with 3G, it's only gotten worse.
Advice to Management
Learn the basics of CPG. You NEED people in the company who have this expertise and mindset or you cannot succeed. Before you decide that driving topline growth and taking a long term view is not important, look out 3-5 years and you will see that if you continue on this collision course, there will not even be pieces left to sell off. As you continue to deplete brand equity, your assets will disintegrate. It is a shameful way to memorialize those who built them.

","The focus of Kraft Heinz is to squeeze every dollar out of the brand names they own. When they let people go from Kraft as the merger closed, they were so incredibly short sighted as to cut people loose when no one remaining had any access or basic understanding of how to complete the in-process work within the procurement applications. In other words, their point of view was just get those people out of here and we don't care about whatever mess is left.

","A lot of the reviews you will read about this company come from people talking about how the old Kraft or the old Heinz were great and the new company is terrible. This might sound to some like the reviews are coming from bitter former employees who were let go for not being up to par, or maybe people who don't handle change well, etc. That may be true. But don't assume that all the negative reviews come from substandard employees. 

The company truly does not have a long term vision for how they will continue to operate at current pace. The 3G model is all about cutting costs and experience - replacing high cost, highly experienced employees with young, inexpensive MBA talent. And there is nothing wrong with that at the surface. The problem occurs when that young, inexperienced talent is brought in to lead projects/department, etc. and they don't have anyone to coach, mentor, or train them. There are serious risks that the company takes and exposes itself to, because the decision makers may only have a couple of years in the workforce and don't know what they don't know.

It is becoming less and less common to find people that have been with the company for more than 2 or 3 years, 5+ years (outside of the manufacturing environment) is extremely rare. This company may be a good place for a young MBA grad to get an iconic company name on their resume, maybe even get promoted quickly, and then get out after two years to go find a ""real"" job. The problem is that that person will quickly find themself failing in any other management role outside of KHC because they have not learned the fundamental things a manager needs to know to succeed in any normal business.

Finally, no mater who you are, you will not be immune to the constant, unexpected layoffs. of course after the acquisition of Kraft, many Kraft employees were let go. Not a huge surprise, but the number of people laid off, and they type of roles eliminated were somewhat concerning. Then, the field restructuring was announced, and hundreds more manufacturing employees will be let go over time as plants consolidate and close. Then, a few months ago, another round of corporate restructuring meant about 200-300 more salaried employees were let go. And this time, it wasn't just the ""low hanging fruit"" - underperformers or redundant roles. It was the result of senior management saying, ""We need to save $XXXXXX in salaries, so each team needs to cut X number of people. Figure it out."" So strong performers were let go. Many of the remaining experienced people were let go. people who were critical to major projects were let go. So now what? Already lean teams need to scramble to fill holes, expensive consultants need to be brought in to pick up the work, and the bare minimum level of work will get done. There won't be opportunities to really produce good, quality work. If you are still there, you won't ever feel proud of your work, because your team is so lean, you all have to work yourselves day and night just to produce the bare minimum, because there are no resources available to you. And you will do that day after day because every day you are afraid of losing your job.

They could care less about their people. The only thing that matters to them is profit and loss. It is a completely financially driven company (owned by 3G- a private equity firm)- all other functions take the back burner. The politics are so awful- people are encouraged to stay quiet during certain meetings by upper management. Long hours are expected- people will literally ask you where you are going if you try to leave the office at 5. Some teams are expected to work until midnight regularly. 

They are so focused on cutting costs that in Chicago the employees are forced to pay for plastic utensils at lunch. 

It is not a place for growth and development. It is a place where people are smothered and broken. If you care at all about being happy at work, you will not even consider taking a job here. People literally quit every single week. It is so unstable.

There is a reason this company is rated so poorly, the majority of the legacy Kraft talent (great folks) were laid off or proactively resigned. Listen to the warnings here. For the life of me, I cannot imagine a more poorly run organization or a worse company to go to than this place. Anything, and I mean anything, is better than this toxic environment, If you do decide to roll the dice and accept a position here, be warned, and keep one eye open always. Your colleagues may very well be out to get you.
Advice to Management
None worth noting as they don't care what people think. Instead, my advice to prospective applicants is to stay away until after Kraft and 3G are no longer aligned. As long as the Brazilians are running this company, it will continue to be a breeding ground of mistrust, contempt and agony. I truly believe this is the worst company in the U.S. to work for, and I challenge anyone to find one worse than this place.

Also, no foundation is really laid when you're in a role for 3-6 months, especially for employees young in their career.

Laser like focus on Zero Based Budgeting.
","There is no vision or strategy to grow the brands and organically grow the firm! The only strategy they pursue is ZBB which includes counting office supplies and eliminating 40% of head count to achieve savings and increase EBITDA.
Senior management (C level) are all comprised of freckle faced, intelligent Brazilians but grossly inexperienced in running a global CPG firm with $28B revenue. They have very low emotional quotient and hence cannot be good leaders or motivate and manage people. They are more concerned with running endless transactional minutia and routines (40 routines per week, sometime people have to provide daily updates on 5 tasks)! They have no clue as how to defend market share and as a result will lose more market share, means less revenue and then reduce more head count and the cycle continues...
The workplace is a revolving door. The talent base has been decimated in all functions through massive lay-offs. I would estimate that 30% of corporate positions have been eliminated - some of the top talent survived the first 2 waves but then in Jan 16 85 people resigned and moved on. The new talent they hired fit the 3G mold with 0 CPG experience. As a result the people left behind are perennially looking for jobs! Even the head of ZBB resigned!
The management by objectives (MBO) is nothing special but a smart goal system which is publicly visible. But it allows a quarterly evaluation of your performance vs. goals and hence you can get fed after Q2 for not hitting your goal!

Tue Jan 26 2016, Senior Accountant,"Pittsburgh, PA",Former Employee ,Worst Ever,32,"Only good thing was the pay….but what is your soul worth?
","Worst management I have ever worked for because:

1) Management lied about the hours expected from you: was told that overtime was occasional on job interview to find that overtime in needed every day to get the amount of work done that they dump on you!


2) Wasn’t told in interview that there are NO raises unless you get promoted (see #6 about promotions). So you could be the best at your job and go the extra mile only to be told, “Good Job, maybe you’ll see a Bonus” (if the private equity firm allows it.)

3) The most often words I heard from Management were: “I can’t speak to that.” or “that’s beyond my scope”

4) Never worked somewhere before where I was told by management to NOT help people outside our department.

5) Even though our corporate handbook had windows of times for business hours to be at work, I was told by management to be in early every day, and then was given the stink eye for leaving a 5.

6) Was told by senior management that I could not be promoted because I didn’t have enough “sweat equity”. I was told that I do my job the best of anyone who has had my position before, but I would need to also do the job of the position I wanted for at least a year or two before I would get the title, not to mention doing my job also. That’s right, I was told that I would have to do the work of 2 people and not be paid for it until one or two years into the future.

7) Senior management would put any issues you present to them on your project list for you to correct. This would include following up with their peers, instead of them doing it themselves doing their millions of meeting. I swear the meetings were so they could hide from work and responsibilities.

8) Never worked with so many people that were in finance that had NO finance background. I guess that is the talent you are stuck with when you lay off tons of people and have a policy to NOT rehire any one that used to work for the company. I worked with Finance people that majored in History, Politics and Psychology. NO JOKE, the $5B divisional CFO was a person from a treasury department who needed “working capital” explained to him every month during cash flow meetings. 

9) Management hires “Management Trainings” to get them coffee, schedule their meetings and post positive reviews on websites (like Glassdoor) instead of doing any real work!

10) NO Team environment.

11) Told if I wanted to keep my job, I’d have to move from Pittsburgh to Chicago with no change in salary for cost of living.

Conclusion: The company and people there are all jokes and phonies. I’m actually embarrassed I worked for this company and this is what’s wrong with America. Thanks to you: Warren Buffet and your Brazilian Death Squad, which is the killer of American Jobs and Iconic Brands. Hope you all are proud of yourselves!!!!!!!!!

Attendance is a joke, I believe 17% daily due to calling in. Because of this, forcing for overtime is a nessecity to keep up with demands. A lot of mechanical failures plague operations. This can be contributed to the nonexistent preventative maintenance programs exercised. USDA turns a blind eye to the ""holesomeness"" of the product and the ""sanitary conditions"" of raw production. I give anyone a 50% chance of making it 6 months there. if you show up to work with a pulse, everyday, you will have guaranteed employment at this facility. Daily, you will hear everyone talk about how much they hate coming to work, hate the company, hate everything. It is literally a joke, please think twice before accepting a position here. I can't stress enough the severity in this review, I am holding back much more, as I'm sure others restrained as well. Good luck.

Advice to Management
Take better care of your employees because you can't achieve results without them. Trust your employees, they have the right intentions. Allow employees more flexibility, they work very hard and long hours. Reward your employees more they truly deserve it. 

Advice to job seekers: Know what you're signing up for. If you look for a career with work life balance then run from this company. You don't want to work here and they don't want you to work there either. If you want to work hard and are willing to place your personal life on the back burner then this could be the place for you. This is a place to grow and learn but don't expect anything in return from your hard work. It's obvious that this company cares more about a solid bottom line instead of their employees well being. Some of the reviews are extreme in how they are depicting the company but there's some truth at the heart of it.

I have been working at Kraft Heinz Company full-time for more than a year
Pros
-Working for a top CPG company with well-known brands
-Exposure to leadership
-Friendly co-workers
-Dual headquarters located in Chicago and Pittsburgh, which are two great cities to live in
-For some the amount of responsibility given to even junior-level people can be a pro
Cons
-Constant change in people, leadership, & processes that cause an insane amount of waste, re-work, lack of resources, and onboarding
-Extreme cost cutting has hurt employee benefits, the company culture, and the overall success that Kraft Heinz can achieve with its products
-Due to the constant changes and heavy cost cutting, work/life balance is a struggle for many employees
-Value of meritocracy is not followed, as most people end up being promoted only because their boss quit or was let go
-Furthermore, many workers are either promoted without a sufficient pay raise and some are not promoted, but just take on another person's job without a pay increase
-Little acknowledgment of a job well done from leadership
-Always a fear among employees that they will be laid off
-A very weak support and training system for newer employees
-Crazy tight deadlines with budget cuts and limited resources that make completing most projects on time impossible
-Too many meetings at times that take away from in-market impact and actions

Overall, a very poor culture has been created in which most employees are very negative about the work they do and their job. I would say at least 70% of my co-workers I talk to are actively looking to move to another company. Kraft Heinz is certainly not a great company to work for at this point in time.

Sun Nov 08 2015,Anonymous,"Pittsburgh, PA",Former Employee ,Happy to be gone!,37,"Pre-June 2013, I loved my job. I was a valued member of the team, made positive & meaningful contributions to the business, and our input was sought after in order to make decisions as a group. The people were wonderful, bright, and experienced. Company policies and systems worked almost flawlessly. None of that was left when I left....it's a sad display of corporate greed and a chaotic, miserable mess. Inexperience reigns....it's exactly what they had in mind though, so I guess they consider it a success. Biggest pro for me: I'm not there!
","Post-Destruction of an Iconic brand: Layoffs followed by taking on the jobs of 2/3 people, policy changes without employees' input by people who barely spoke English let alone understood how things worked in reality. No concern for their customers' businesses. Saving millions of dollars looks great on paper, but the mess it leaves in its wake is true and utter destruction. Chaos was an understatement. Employees are seen as a means to an end....don't dare question what they want you to do...just do it or you'll have 3 angry Brazilians standing behind you at your cafeteria-style table speaking Portuguese to each other saying who knows what. 

Some tips if this sounds like the place for you: 

*Don't leave your desk to go to the restroom or lunch....eat at your desk so they see you working, otherwise prepare to explain where you were....or they may just call you on your cell phone to track you down. 

*Keep working until you see your manager leaving (probably at 7 or 8pm) Meritocracy!!! You will get rewarded for your hard work.....in your dreams. In reality, they will just hold off on hiring an employee for those 3 other people that quit....you will get their jobs too! It's ok though, because they've pared your job down to something a well-trained monkey could do. 

*No need to worry about those pesky customers, half the time, there won't be any product to ship or nobody will seem to know where that product ended up....it might be there sitting on the dock....or it may have never even been produced....nobody seems to know.

","All 3G cares about is cost-cutting. 

Leadership preaches “meritocracy,” but the reality is that if you are well paid because of years of hard work & and top-rated performance, your history does not matter; your job will be eliminated. Leadership has no problem cutting high potential, high performing employees in lieu of inexperienced, lesser paid employees. Conversely, mediocre performers are kept if their compensation is low relative to peers. “Meritocracy” is a farce, and 3G’s flippant use of this word makes my blood boil. 

Those left at Kraft Heinz are working around the clock. Inexperienced 3G cronies are leading without a clue on process, creating inefficiencies in the work force. For a management team that preaches ""creating efficiency"", they place zero value on human capital efficiency. Perhaps compensation should be hourly (i.e., variable cost) to force 3G/Kraft Heinz leadership to actually think about efficiency in the broader sense of the word.

This merger was a “no win” for any Kraft employee, unless you were one of the top executives who pocketed millions due to Golden Parachutes. Those left at Kraft Heinz are working double time for the same or marginally higher pay. Those laid-off are in a job market that is saturated with top Kraft talent. Yes, severance packages were great, but as someone who actually wants to work, I’m mourning the loss of a company and job that is no longer. 
I grew up in a country where hard work is supposed to be rewarded – the definition of capitalism. What I’ve learned is that the rewards from years of hard work can abruptly come to an end when wealthy foreign investors make short-term decisions to pad their wallets. It’s sad that 3G can continue to buy and steamroll American companies, eliminating thousands and thousands of jobs without regard to peoples’ livelihoods. 

I couldn’t think of worse people to work for.

","Poor culture since the merger of Heinz and Kraft. 19 year employee that took pride in working hard for results and pride in who I worked for. Sad to say that is not the case any longer. I would not recommend the new KraftHeinz to a family or friend who is looking to start a career. No longer a place about its employees, or work life balance. As I mentioned before, I enjoyed working hard for the results of my business. To the tune of 60-65 hours a week. Working thru vacations or time off, because I felt ownership and pride in my sales results. That is no longer the case. One could work 80 hours a week and never feel you are accomplishing anything. Employee cut backs, moving service (administrative, finance) work to India, closing plants is not the proud Kraft Company I was hired by. If a 1/2 star rating was available, that would be my rating for the New Kraft Heinz Company. 

Do yourself and your family a favor, look elsewhere when beginning your career. If you would be proud to work for Bernardo Hess and Kraft Heinz, who let go of employees within 24 hours of being notified, who spent 15-42 years with a company, then this company is for you.

Sun Oct 11 2015,N/A,"Pittsburgh, PA"," in Pittsburgh, PA",WORST COMPANY ON EARTH,46,"literally none. Maybe some other departments will have one good thing or two, but finance depart is a total night mare.
","If there is a reward for the most ridiculous company of the century, it will have to go to Heinz without discussion. Heinz is absolutely the worst of the worst among all companies I've known of. My words are strong but sadly they are just the truth.

First of all, this company shows absolutely no respect to its employees. It doesn't care about you being a human being or having a personal life - your privacy means nothing to the leadership, meaning that they will ask for your number and hunt you down no matter what time it is and no matter what you are doing - on the toilet or giving birth in a hospital. Who cares? Just send me the excel in the next 20 mins. Your privacy and human rights are being invaded with a seemingly justified reason - we have a tight deadline. How about hiring more people instead of making one person do three people's jobs? Hours are bad, although personally I don't really struggle with being stuck for working long hours. However it does make you feel less enthusiastic when the leadership takes it for granted and never shows a bit of appreciation. 

Second of all, there is literally no culture or whatsoever here. The HR will tell you it's highly collaborative and supportive here, while the fact is you often have to spend 80% of your time on a daily basis chasing after people for data/materials, or sending emails to mangers/directors asking for information but being ignored. There are no training for new recruits, which is fine. But the majority of people only care about their own job routines and are extremely indifferent in teaching or helping, and it could really make things difficult for you.

Third, the company is so frugal that I have to write a book about it someday and sell it on amazon. There is only water and tea in the kitchen - not even ketchup. OK fine it is no big deal. Then you soon realize that you have to bring your own pens and paper for work because there is no office supplies. Well can still deal with it. How about cutting your bonus because the leadership keeps adjusting up the EBITDA target that there is absolutely no way to hit? Sometimes I wonder, do they really not know the incapability to hit the lines they set up? My guess is that they do know, but there is a better way to save the spending in people compensation - cutting bonuses by setting up a high internal target that the company is certainly going to miss. So convenient. 

Forth, a great amount of time at work is wasted because the company has a very poor data management system. Numbers aren't tied across different database, mappings are often in chaos, and there are often a lot of manual dirty work going on behind the scenes that causes the inconsistency between your numbers and mine. If you graduate from a top school and have high expectation of what you will be learning at work, please avoid here just the sake of this one - you will be spending most of your time trying to solve issues that can be easily avoided by having a better IT system. You aren't learning anything real.

Overall all the negative feedback you are seeing here - from me or others - are true. And I do think it's inevitable having 3G as the management. They just want to get rich - that's what Private Equity do. They are not here to plant tomatoes. While the stock price of food companies often stays very stable and has a very low beta, 3G's tactic here is definitely not to reap profits by boosting up the business itself. With very aggressive cost cutting (zero base budgeting), it is very much easier to boost up the bottom line while maintain the stock price at a decent level. After a few years? Of course the business suffers. But it will be probably time for them to transfer ownership already.

Make your own judgement. But Heinz is rated 2.0 here. The lowest score on Glassdoor is 1.7. if you join Heinz, one day you might be able to write a review such as this one and contribute to making Heinz literally the worst company on Glassdoor.

","Little to no support or direction for individuals pushed into new or unfamiliar roles post merger. Young middle leadership is not providing guidance and is quite overwhelmed. Most leaders are coming in from overseas, and most have been with legacy Heinz for 4-5 years but have had 4-6 jobs during that time. Difficult to learn and deliver upon results in that short of time. Removed focus on innovation and shifted to cost cutting initiatives - limited top line growth with that strategy. I'm doubtful Wall Street will tolerate that more than one or two cycles.

Multiple unpaid shutdowns a year. Company claims meritocracy, but it doesn't exist.

Sat Sep 12 2015, Manager,"Pittsburgh, PA",Former Employee ,Talks the talk but doesn’t walk the walk,26,"To be perfectly honest there are none. 

Heinz was once a fine company and one that I was proud to work for; however, 3G Capital has changed all that.
","Let's start with layoffs, buyouts, early retirements, ""voluntary resignations"", plant closures, etc. to prune the workforce down to a combination of young (read lesser paid employees) and those who either lack the motivation, education or skills to succeed elsewhere. 

Tenured employees who didn't leave and were formerly not considered for promotion now find themselves stars in management positions without the wherewithal to succeed. 

Next is the lack of work/life balance. Since staff has been cut and one person is now doing the work of many, with no direction or support from management, the result is chaos-induced-stress and long hours. 

Add to that importing cronies from Brazil, who lack the necessary skills to run the company for long-term success and the future is not bright. Can they cut costs and show short-term profit? You betcha!! It's hard to say how long Wall Street will listen to excuses though.

Be wary of positive and glowing reviews as they appear to be ""planted"" to offset the truth.

Mon Aug 24 2015,Anonymous,"Pitts, PA",Current Employee ,Unbelieveable what goes on,26,"There is nothing good about this company
","Just a horrible place to work. Work stations are tiny and crowded. Someone comes over to talk to the worker next to you and you have their behind literally in your face. Its noisy and dirty. No one knows what their doing. Managers are miserable and either wont help you or don't know how to help. No chance for a raise ever! Employee's leave and no one even acknowledges it. They just had that persons work over for you to do more. Heinz not only treats its employees bad it treats its customers horribly. The company thinks its to big to fail. They will just squash anyone that gets it the way.

Sun Sep 06 2015, Order Fulfillment Analyst,"Warrendale, PA",Current Employee ,Terrible company to work for,7,"Hours are 8-4:30. This is actually the only pro. If you work at the Innovation Center, you don't have to pay for parking.
","Customer service management is a joke. They micromanage, don't even know how to use SAP or what our job is. People that get promoted are also jokes.. Very immature, have no experience, more concerned with going out and drinking than their actual job. The so-called 15% bonus we were told we would get when we were hired turned out to be a whopping $700, which is not even a paycheck. There have been no raises for people that have stayed in the same position for at least 3 years. Management also expects you to stay late to work, some people staying until 9pm during our SAP conversion, yet not even a thank you, bonus, or raise. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Save yourself the misery.
Advice to Management
Reevaluate your management. Most of customer service is quitting because of management. Also there have been no incentives for anyone to stay with the lack of raises. People have been trying to move out of customer service for a year, yet management does not help. I would not use one of my current managers as a reference ever.

Great Work-life balance, Employee career development, very talented and collaborative teams to work with. Goal oriented, strategic business planning and investment in employees and business partners.
","Absolutely no value to talent, didn't put any efforts to preserve institutional knowledge. Don't anticipate any growth for this company. Hardly any innovation is going to come from KHC in upcoming years, if any, they will keep maintaining their current brands. With half of the talent and most of the valuable senior and most knowledgeable people gone, very intrigued to see what's next.

Heinz's product portfolio is quiet different than Kraft's. While Heinz had quiet a few self stable and/or frozen products, Kraft has much diverse portfolio including refrigerated and room temp products. The same tactics that worked for Heinz 3 years back very likely won't work in KraftHeinz.

Getting hammered by management builds camaraderie within teams
","- Entire culture is a lie and a ploy to get employees to give up all work-life balance and competitive compensation and accept unreasonable demands, while they dangle fake ""meritocracy"" as a carrot
- All career advancement depends on politics
- Heinz and now Kraft are being run into the ground by upper management which doesnt know what it is doing (all came from a railroad company). Anyone can just fire people indiscriminately, but it takes someone who knows what they are doing to make smart cost cuts where it wont hurt future growth prospects. Just look at their top line results.

PS: Many of these positive reviews are clearly written by HR, which is just pathetic.

They certainly dont need my advice. The top 10 people in the company as well as 3G/Berkshire Hathaway are making a killing by destroying the company. Once they are done, they will move on to the next one. The model works for them (and makes them very rich) but doesnt work for the employees.

","Heinz focus on cost is important, but not the way they are doing it. There is no logic to the position reductions, it's just cut off the top and clean up the mess later. Kraft is going to be wrecked for everyone but the stock holders.
