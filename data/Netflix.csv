Thu Sep 20 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,How much does a functioning human cost?,510,"- Paycheck
- So many good people
- Such a great service
- Hope
","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?

","1. Definitely a culture of fear. People are let go constantly if they're not performing. The company is very open about this part of their culture, so just know what you're getting in to.
2. Company used to have a very strong culture (read their culture memo). That culture has evolved and, in the opinion of many people who've been there for a while, eroded. People regularly ignore key principles of the culture. Part of it is due to the company's rapid growth. Netflix with 8000 employees is very different from Netflix with 1000 employees 6-7 years ago. That level of rapid growth seriously diluted the culture.
3. Much less freedom & responsibility than in the past. Becoming more bureaucratic and political.
4. Much less forthright and candid from management. For example, management recently got rid of the 5% free options. Management framed it as more choice for employees (as the 5% free options were converted to cash salary, which employees can then allocate to options if they want), but as the comp philosophy of top of market typically didn't take into account the 5% free options, employees viewed this move as management disingenuously reducing salaries by 5%.
5. because there are so many more employees, career growth is much more limited (just a natural consequence of greater number of employees, more niche roles, etc.).

","The high stress workplace is real and true. We called it “Netflix and Drill” opposed to Chill. Employees on your team are not afraid to give you feedback which is encouraged in the workplace. Whether you are an assistant giving feedback to a director or the other way around , everyone is more or else walking on egg shells. 

Very little training and everyone expects you to be a top performer. There is the expression “drinking from the fire hose” , literally blasting you with information everyday. I was expected to support a director running a 15 person team perfectly after 1 week of questionable training. 

Also the hiring process was deceiving - they promised a great role with salary which has different benefits than hourly employees , then proceeded to demand references including my employer at the time BEFORE sending me their offer. I had to basically announce I was leaving to my former boss of over 2 years (with no choice) before even having an offer letter and they then had the audacity to reduce my role and benefits to an hourly role with brief apology. I had to take it and was laid off 5 months later...
Advice to Management
Netflix is undoubtedly a premiere movie studio and paying big cash to acquire / poaching the best talent from executive down to assistant. With this power it seems they’re losing senses with hiring and failing to provide a real structure of a company where people feel safe and excited to work. Everyone I encountered there was always stressed. Unless you’re Reed or a C-level exec , no one is safe technically but my advice would be to have it less about expecting a top performance from the start and actually train employees to become better at their jobs overtime.

","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager.

","Culture of fear. Indoctrination into a culture that is focused on intimidation and unattainable aspirations. The company grew so quickly that right-fit managers for a startup are now managing large numbers of people and they are incompetent. Due to this incompetence, the culture has become cut-throat where many people have been rapidly fired without justification. Often it’s political because their management fears the person being fired would replace them. Management is dishonest about the “transparency” of salaries and raises where favorites are rewarded rather than those who actually perform. The higher people are in levels of management, the greater the pressure to give up all personal life including family and children. Successful executives are dysfunctional with no personal lives. The culture memo or “deck” is a deceitful document now. It’s become weaponized and is used to humiliate people and fire them. There is no warning before being fired. It’s a surprise process where people are often told they are no longer employed and told to leave the building immediately. Management then communicates a fabricated version widespread to many employees by email or meetings, often stating that there were repeated coaching and warnings. There is none.

","While working at Netflix, I have dealt with more cons than pros. Especially while working with leadership. The directors don't seem to show humility towards their subordinates; and their assistants often reflect the same attitudes. 

I can recall a specifc instance when I had to work with the assistant's of the CEO. Back in November, we needed to collaborate on an undisclosed project and I just remember being so astounded at the level of arrogance and superiority that these assistants felt towards me and my team. They were EXTREMELY unprofessional, ignorant and unproductive.

 * Layoffs were regular, often without warning

* As an engineer there is not much growth potential outside earning more money or switching tracks to become a manager
Advice to Management
Netflix likes to use an example where they fired 20% of the staff in the early days of the company and in the aftermath saw an increase in productivity. This strategy worked once in the past and is not a reliable benchmark. I witnessed high quality engineers and managers fired throughout my two years there. It was regular, and often, each time crushing team morale and weeks of productivity lost. In my one on ones I'd probe at everyone's happiness and never once did I hear anyone say they were happy to work there. All seemed to indicate they're sticking around for the pay - knowing their days are limited and one day will be rewarded with a ""generous severance package"" - as the culture deck describes.

As for the sexist/racist hiring practices, making radical short term adjustments to account for years for bias hiring practices is not the correct approach. Improving diversity within the company should be organic. What I witnessed in my last year there was nothing short of illegal hiring practices.

","As a team leader you are immediately tasked with acclimating quickly to a vary “culty” type culture. You need to use the proper vernacular and Netflix language, making sure to give and take hard feedback and that is the currency internally. You will immediately be pressured to apply the “Keeper Test” to evaluate your team and if you don’t let someone go quickly (Like within weeks) you’re likely to be perceived as weak. 

The workload is frenzied. There are so many titles launching that there is very little time to be truly strategic on the approach unless you’re working on one of the big blockbuster titles.

- Solid engineering culture
- Small company with little politics, process and BS to contend with.
- Easy to get help, everyone makes time and is approachable.
- You can accomplish a lot if you are motivated and have good ideas.
- The logical thing/decision almost always happens.
- Amazing focus in the company, very little distractions
- Excellent communication flow. There are no secrets, everything is considered “context” that could help you do your job better.
","(To be clear these are all small cons! Netflix really is great!)

- Since it’s a small company that only hires A players, teams and scope can be small. 
- Could be more customer focused. Big focus on innovation, but primarily through the lens of what the data says and what the business values. This could be more balanced.
- Stock option Program is decent, but a little complicated and risky. I would prefer RSU or stock purchase plan instead of options.
- Location. Los Gatos is great but pretty far south. Not a great commute for most folks, particularly those living in the city.

","Culture deck is a bunch of lies. The reality is this:

a) It hard to find ""stunning collages"" because hiring is broken. If you are good at talking, and repeating culture jargon in the interview, you can easily get it. You can look in LinkedIn to see the qualification, background and education level of our engineers. Many engineers here are from bodyshop Indian IT firms (the likes of Infosys, TCS etc), who came onsite and simply switched to Netflix - because they can TALK. 

b) Informed captions (mostly managers) are technically incompetent and has no clue on making any informed data driven decisions. Decisions are heavily driven by politics. 

c) The whole push of open and honest feedback is just a sham to make things look good. Providing critical feedback is impossible here, as it mostly backfires and results into getting fired. So people just keep providing rosy feedback. 

d) If you were hired into a bad team or don't like the work, it is very very hard to switch teams. Even if some other manager is willing to take you in their team, the current manager usually retaliates by triggering keeper test and you get fired. Essentially your manager tells the new hiring manager that this person was bad performer so switching team to not get fired. 

e) There is no career growth for ICs here, everyone has the same title and level. However, on management there is clear growth path - double standards.

Wed Feb 20 2019, Customer Service,"Salt Lake City, UT",Former Employee ,"Little culture, mostly just cult.",19,"Good entertainment content and service to consumers.

The good news; it’s easy to get a CSR job. They claim to hire only “top performers”, but you don’t even need to have call center experience to get hired. Also, no background check or drug screening. So if you’re into your substances, you won’t be alone. There are no performance criteria or reviews. Sounds good. However, makes it hard to know where you stand with them. Everyone is in fear of losing their jobs. 

The pay is good. They have to pay higher to keep up with their employee turnover problem. Benefits are OK. Paid parental leave is great. You only have to be employed for a short time and are eligible for months of paid leave, when you or your spouse has a baby. Work a month, get paid for four—a pretty good deal. They make a big deal out of the free coffee, green bananas and trail mix. They supply free toilet paper, too.
","Don’t let the name on the building fool you. The SLC call center is not like the Netflix you see on TV or in the media. It’s just a call center with a fancy name. When looking at reviews, you will want to distinguish between the corporate side of the business (Streaming, Production, Los Gatos, L.A.) and the SLC customer service facility. The customer service division is the stepchild of Netflix. The pay is different, benefits different, policies different, culture different and management way-different. 

You hear a lot about Netflix culture, values and diversity. Don’t mistake corporate’s PR for what’s going on in SLC. SLC has their own set of rules. All of the decision-makers are young, macho, wanna-be hipster, white men. They are very good at playing the game. Do it their way or get out. If you can get along with them, you may have a chance to hang around a while and put the fancy name on your resume. If you’re not one of them, there’s not much advancement opportunity. Netflix CS employees are disposable. Lots of turnover. Because people get sick of the ‘we’re Netflix and you should just be happy to work for us’ ego-crap or are fired for not fitting into the cult-ure.

Mon Oct 29 2018,Anonymous,"Los Angeles, CA",Current Employee ,"Great company, with some growing pains",17,"When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues, they are not kidding: I am constantly impressed with the smart, thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis. I love the company's focus on Inclusion & Diversity (and, I honestly notice it often, by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting), and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles. The transparency is usually great, and it's fun to be a part of an exciting, growing company. The salary is exceptional, and the benefits are also excellent (note: hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits, but it's still great). 

There's a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to (e.g. my kid has a doctor's appointment, I will be WFH, etc.), as well as to make decisions that benefit the company, your team, etc. 

The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it, but I have found that it's pretty right on - there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says, but overall, it's on point.
","Work life balance is a thing, but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries - I work a couple of hours of OT a week, and I am generally ""on call"" in the sense that I will check my email after hours, but I am not expected to work at off hours - in fact, my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things. I do think upper management works very long hours, and that can lead to burn-out. The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation/personal time, and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor's appointments, stuff for your kids, WFH, etc. 

The firing culture doesn't seem to touch ICs as much as it does management. It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through, but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments, questions, concerns, etc. 

I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent, but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things. You have to be smart about choosing the right time/people. 

The onboarding/training needs a lot of work. Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating. I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here, but I am a year in, and feeling much more comfortable. They say it takes about 3 months to feel like you are not drowning, and 6 months to feel like you understand everything - that feels pretty accurate to me.

","Most teams aren't working on anything very innovative. The tech is your standard microservices architecture, and everything gets open-sourced, with a blog post and a nice conference talk. Eventually these projects wither because no one maintains them, and sometimes they don't even solve very effectively the problems they tout, but it's good PR for the engineers and 'leaders'.

Culture of fear is real. My manager was toxic, he loved to talk about diversity even though he was the biggest mansplainer in the room. My interview was interesting, it was a monologue of his rather unique theories of engineering management, most of which was a bunch of gibberish culled from the culture deck. When I got there I found him to be a pretty ineffective manager. He didn't have any engineering vision, no idea of strategy, and wasn't technical. If you get into an interview room and the manager spends 45 mins talking about himself, that's probably a sign to run!

Pick and choose what team you join. You can have either a pretty cool time with some smart folks, or have to deal with narcissists who believe their own PR.

While they pay high wages, and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable. It makes it easy to attract new employees. 

Earlier this year they also announced plans to change tier 1/2 support from internal netflix employees to contracted employees with a call center provider.

* Since there's no strongly enforced standardization of technology stacks, they can be very disparate from team to team, which can lead to duplicate efforts, or implementations that are too tightly coupled to its use case, making it hard to reuse much of what exists.

","1. They either like you or they don’t. You HAVE to play work politics and meet as many upper level managers as possible. Your numbers, your adaption to their “culture”, and your prior work experience DO NOT matter when it comes to growth within the company. 
2. You can’t get up and use the bathroom. Your breaks and lunches can be moved around (if approved by WFM) so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom. You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use. 
3. You had an emergency? If you have the emergency hours to cover it, GREAT! But if you don’t, expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in. They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and it’s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before. 
4. Coaching is a joke. Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on. What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan. My question is, aren’t the sups suppose to know the problems? Aren’t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action? It feels like I’m doing their job and they just say “great idea let me write this down and submit it!” They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down, they will never compliment you. 
5. Utah is a right to work state. In plain English it means the company doesn’t need to have a reason to fire you, hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here. This law allows some employers to abuse the stability of employees and base their decisions on emotions instead performance.
Advice to Management
You want us to live by NetflixCS values yet your own supervisors don’t live up to those values. Stop making it seem like it’s ok to voice our opinion when in reality you fire people for crossing that line or for exposing upper management. You do not provide a stable working environment, nobody leads by example, stop promoting people that are ill equipped for the promotion and most of all stop treating us like customers by POS POS (keeping things positive and avoiding the problem to focus on what CAN be done) and dancing around our questions or concerns.

* Culture states there is transparency but I found that to be only true to some extent.

* There is an air of arrogance from management.

* They only want the cream of the crop, average TSR is just not good enough. This makes for a very high turnover rate.

- Engineering teams competes with each other to build tools. Sometimes the work done for 9 months is thrown because other team built tool with cutting-edge technology.
 - Freedom and responsibility is there but it all depends upon on your leader & how much he allows to exercise it.
- NIH within team syndrome.
- Managers are sometimes pain and always want to build their 'own' team with 'own' people which discourages existing team.
- IF you are looking for growth in the team, be careful of which team you are joining. 
- Favoritism is there and if the Mgr is really bad with employees, but good with his boss, he will get promoted. 360 only matters from peers and not from whom you manage.
- Can't raise question on why we are doing this.If you are not aligned with manager's vision, sorry but you will get axed soon based on ground of technical imcompetency.
- They try lots of recommendation A/B tests and merch logic but they are not sure if people will watch the title or not.

Ultimately they need to realize they are streaming company which has value in only 1 thing : Content. If you build great product but content is not effective, you are relying on product and not content to sell. If rivals catch up on product , its an issue.

","Read the reviews on here. They are an accurate cross-section of experiences that show the reality of working at Netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager, or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager. You will have zero life outside of work, and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer, let alone getting fired, recognize that you--yes, you--will very likely be let go abruptly within your first year--sometimes in a matter of weeks--with no opportunity to improve, at the sole discretion of your manager, who him/herself may or may not be competent or honest. Be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income, and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search. Political backstabbing is the order of the day. The meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesn't scale. Ask anyone who has been at Netflix in a leadership or cross-functional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings, and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done. And finally, if you do survive beyond the first year, don't expect pay progression. They will happily offer you more than whatever you are getting in your current position to bring you in, and then leave your pay stagnant for years if you were already ""over market.""

Fri Jul 07 2017,Anonymous,"Los Gatos, CA",Former Employee ,"Fun ride, fast pace and changes (including your job)",23,"- Good pay
The base pay is very attractive. While it ends up being pretty equal to other companies' total comp, it is enticing to get it up front in your base pay. No guessing on how the company will perform. But understand it is iffy as to whether you will make much more beyond your initial offer.

- Interesting challenges
They really are willing to challenge the status quo and test new ideas. Things are not always arrived at efficiently, but it is great to see innovation throughout the company and not just in tech groups.

- Growing company with solid successes
After being at some tech companies in a downward spiral, it was refreshing to be on the upswing and enjoy the possibilities that come with performing well.
","- Benefits are weirdly inconsistent
Amazing maternity leave but I had to pay quite a bit out-of-pocket for decent family health benefits, bizarre stock option plan, weak vision/dental

- The culture of fear is real in some groups
This is because it depends on your leader. Some leaders manage up well and hide their incompetence by constantly changing their staff. I was the 3 leader of my team in a 4-year period. Also leadership does not enforce the same ""stunning colleague"" standards for non-critical orgs. 

- HR is fairly ineffective (except staffing is great)
HRBPs enable incompetent leaders because they are dependent on them. If a leader gains new teams then typically the HR person gets bigger scope as well. If the business leader doesn't ""connect"" well with their HRBP, you are likely to see the HRBP get a ""generous severance package.""

- Your job can change fast, both good and bad
Be prepared that you can gain new teams and responsibilities quickly, but you can also go from being stunning to out the door in a matter of weeks. I think people get the high standards communication really well from the culture deck, but the speed with which your personal circumstances will change can be shockingly fast.
Advice to Management
Please apply the same quality standards to all parts of business leadership. And weigh a leader's ability by more than their ability to manage up. You know there are some weak leaders on your executive staff right now. Will you do what is easy for you (turn a blind eye to it) or do what is right and best for the employees?

","Everything else. If you want to work 90 hours a week, have no family life, and still get fired after nothing but glowing reviews, then this place is for you! In my case, I gave direct, actionable feedback about a colleague, and that led to my dismissal. The culture deck says feedback is never used to retaliate - but that's not true at all. So fair warning - if you give someone honest feedback about how to improve in their position, be prepared for that to bite you later on. Politics is real here - people are retained or promoted based on who they know, and people are so routinely fired here, regardless of their performance, that everyone is numb to it.

Advice to Management
I was contracted for netflix as a CSR . During my time there , I worked as hard as I could because I genuinely loved my job and where I worked . This specific location in clearwater is nice because they do give you a lot to do while on the phone and during idle time . There's foosball , a ping pong table , and a "" NRD lab"" where they have probably 8 tvs on the wall where they play different netflix tv shows and movies ( Supposed to be SFW but sometimes , especially very late at night we could watch whatever we wanted) There were also multiple tv's across the floor in about half of the pods and sometimes they would put on sports games and things to keep us happy . If you take all of that into consideration it sounds pretty great. All in all , I think most people there genuinely want to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible . The biggest issue they have is the people who are put into management . Even before I was there , there had been a line of people who all had been promoted purely because they were close with the right people . When it came to promotions ( To either CSR II or TL ) there was no rhyme or reason really what so ever. When you were put up for a promotion , they would tell you that it was going to be based off of stats, attendance, and professionalism . That is not usually what ended up happening . In my experience there the person that had some personal tie to either a specific TL or OM would always be the one to get the promotion . It was this way for absences as well . The attendance policy is on a rolling 60 day timeframe . That means ; you may not have more than 4 ""Occurrences"" in 60 days or you would come up for review . When occurrences were actually given was definitely not regulated. The way around this is just basically to take 3 days off in a row if you're going to call off . People would apply for a weekend off and never be able to get it because they didn't allow very many requests those days . So the solution that they came up with is that if you were close to a TL , you could get them to put you on a MLOA or a PLOA . Better yet , be friends with an OM and you can literally just call them like your personal attendance line and get VTO (Voluntary time off) . Favorites WERE played. Now , there are some GREAT people there. I met some really really great friends there . But the problem is that they don't have a great way of dealing with anything . If something went down , there was no uniform way of dealing with it .

Helpful (6","I was contracted for netflix as a CSR . During my time there , I worked as hard as I could because I genuinely loved my job and where I worked . This specific location in clearwater is nice because they do give you a lot to do while on the phone and during idle time . There's foosball , a ping pong table , and a "" NRD lab"" where they have probably 8 tvs on the wall where they play different netflix tv shows and movies ( Supposed to be SFW but sometimes , especially very late at night we could watch whatever we wanted) There were also multiple tv's across the floor in about half of the pods and sometimes they would put on sports games and things to keep us happy . If you take all of that into consideration it sounds pretty great. All in all , I think most people there genuinely want to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible . The biggest issue they have is the people who are put into management . Even before I was there , there had been a line of people who all had been promoted purely because they were close with the right people . When it came to promotions ( To either CSR II or TL ) there was no rhyme or reason really what so ever. When you were put up for a promotion , they would tell you that it was going to be based off of stats, attendance, and professionalism . That is not usually what ended up happening . In my experience there the person that had some personal tie to either a specific TL or OM would always be the one to get the promotion . It was this way for absences as well . The attendance policy is on a rolling 60 day timeframe . That means ; you may not have more than 4 ""Occurrences"" in 60 days or you would come up for review . When occurrences were actually given was definitely not regulated. The way around this is just basically to take 3 days off in a row if you're going to call off . People would apply for a weekend off and never be able to get it because they didn't allow very many requests those days . So the solution that they came up with is that if you were close to a TL , you could get them to put you on a MLOA or a PLOA . Better yet , be friends with an OM and you can literally just call them like your personal attendance line and get VTO (Voluntary time off) . Favorites WERE played. Now , there are some GREAT people there. I met some really really great friends there . But the problem is that they don't have a great way of dealing with anything . If something went down , there was no uniform way of dealing with it . When controversial topics would come out we were basically told not to say anything conflicting or anything that could get us or them into trouble. But when it comes to people calling screaming at you about a show called ""Dear White People"" calling you racist and asking RIDICULOUS questions , the ""No comment"" thing doesn't really work .

Wed Mar 01 2017, Senior User Experience Designer,"Los Gatos, CA",Former Employee ,"Fast paced, high performing, high turnover, engineering-first",30,"I really enjoyed my time at Netflix, it's a bold company to work for and you are surrounded by people who are passionate about what they do. I always say the health of the company starts at the top and Reed Hastings is someone I highly respect as he can see through people's BS and keeps those around him honest. He's the kind of person that will give you personal and professional advice even at an all hands with hundreds of people in attendance. The work will feel like you're being 'thrown to the fire' due to the culture of high performance and no subscribed process, but if you know what you're doing and stay dedicated to your team's goals in a productive manner, you should be fine.
","While there are incredibly bright and talented designers at Netflix, I learned through my time there that this company was an engineering-first company. I mean, look at how long it took them to change the logo and get some design standards going. Design often times felt like a luxury than a necessity and there was a bit too much dependency on A/B testing to make decisions. I swear, I heard ""have we A/B tested this yet?"" in my dreams. A few times, I would point out that the results of the A/B test resulted in bad design solutions. It just seemed like upper management didn't understand design. As long as people are watching content and streaming patterns are on the up, then don't rock the boat. Also, watch out for those who play politics, sometimes the drama that plays out on projects or team dynamics is just unreal and some people just want to be the hero and get Reed Hasting's blessing. Unfortunately, there are some ""brilliant jerks"" in the company, learn to work around them and get stuff done right! Lastly, if you want a more life/work balance, this is probably not the place for you. I had some coworkers who didn't see their kids for days.
Advice to Management
Everyone looks so serious at work, address this lack of fun or effect on morale. Also, make design matter more to the business.

Sun Apr 02 2017, Senior Software Engineer,"Los Gatos, CA",Former Employee ,Best company culture I've experienced!,8,"The company culture was extremely empowering - as an employee I really felt like I was listened to and had the freedom to do what I felt was best for the business. Knowing that management wanted employees at every level to understand the long and short term business strategies so that they could themselves make the best decisions for the business was extremely empowering - this kind of transparency is rare in companies. Coworkers were really smart and passionate about what they did. Management was self reflective and introspective. The company was constantly innovating and looking for ways to improve, so you never felt like you were sitting still. Perks and compensation were also the best I've experienced in my career.
","Due to rapid growth over the 4 years I was there, perhaps a little bit of the culture was lost or watered down, mostly in terms of feeling like you perhaps knew fewer people as the company grew. No opportunities to work remote - when I moved out of state I would have loved to have continued to work for Netflix (at the same time, I understand why they don't want remote employees).

Fri Jul 08 2016,N/A,"Los Gatos, CA","Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA","The best job I've had, and at times, the worst job I've had",137,"Netflix has some great pros. You'll be working with mostly extremely competent people. Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and don't accept jobs with teams that you don't feel excited about being part of.
","The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.
This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off. If you've never felt this, it's a rotten state of mind, and you will feel it quite a bit here.
Many times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.

Moral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place. Adjust for your standard of living appropriately so you can keep your head above the circus fray, and don't get used to the good things.
Advice to Management
More communication with your teams is absolutely essential if you want to retain good people, but you don't need a Glassdoor review to tell you that. Empower your HR teams to instill the idea that taking time off is a healthy part of working here, and no one should feel nervous about taking time off. You will need to say this many times before it becomes part of the culture.

Ensure that teams are not competing against each other, specifically in the Engineering department. We are not here to throw each other off our respective ladders, but to learn, and to help the company grow as a result of what we learn here. Cross-collaboration between teams should be of the utmost priority, not working at cross-purposes as is the case with many teams now.

For the most part, this is a good place to be. Make it better, and make more of an effort at every level to keep the organization flat. We already have job insecurity, we do not need hierarchy to make it worse.

The chat team was dissolved, and then they shifted my hours to meet 'business needs' which took away the last bit of faith I had that they care about the employee. Supposedly you can choose from set shifts, but the time you pick is randomly assigned, meaning if you're randomly assigned to pick last, then there are no good options left. Could also mean that you work there for 2.5 years like my coworker and never get to have a weekend day off. 
In training they told us over and over again that top performers were promoted within 3 to 6 months but there have literally been no opportunities. They said numbers didn't matter, they promised unlimited time off, and a whole host of other perks. That has all been blatantly false, the entire job is a numbers game, you sit glued to your desk waiting for a coaching or meeting to break up the nightmare of the day but those keep getting pushed off to the future, which never happens. Unlimited time off was taken away, and you could be fired for a whole host of silly reasons, I myself have seen multiple coworkers walked off the floor for minor infractions, and the new policy of only 3 tardies (which could be 1 minute late) per YEAR is punitive. Even the free drinks are slowly being taken away, we have stupid lemon water options now or espresso, which I can't drink. This job has given me anxiety, I am actively looking for a different job and will quit the moment I'm able.

Don't lie to your employees, hire enough people so that you're not glued to the phone with back to back calls all day, promote an option of breaking up the work day instead of sitting stuck in the cubicle.

I was told CRS2 would be avaliable August of 2016, that got pushed to January of 2017, then March of 2017, and now maybe 6 months into the future. That's ridiculous, and it has created a dead end job culture that there feels like no escaping from.

","You will literally quit a decent job to come here thinking you have found something great only to find that you have stepped in front of an immature high school firing squad. There is no obectivity to the termination process so any of them could terminate for unethical reasons that are summed up in the phrase, you are not a high performer or you weren't a right fit. There constantly breathing down your neck and watching you looking for you to do something wrong. THeres little warning. Generally you get one. If your lucky or buddy buddy with with management or the supes you might get a bit more slack, maybe a lot more. If they dont like what they see they could be rid of you in less than a month and they openly joke about terminating people and about how expendable you are from day one. I read the reviews on here and went in and smellled the fish immediately. FIrst off they bring on a ton of people all the time for an amazing job so where do they end up. All of this is contingent on whether they decide if you are fit for production. You could be let go at the end of training and they dont give you any metrics on how that decision is made.
Advice to Management
Remember that you are giving skilled people an amazing offer that leads many to leave stable employment. By making impossibly high expectations with no metrics applied to the termination process the vast majority wont hit the mark and office politics will govern the termination process. Luring people into a firing pit hurts them and there families and puts a dent in there career. Remember that. Your hurting people.

Wed Jan 11 2017,N/A,, ,Experience totally based on supervisor. They have too much power,15,"Good work, good pay. Energetic environment. New technologies.
","Experience in Netflix totally depends on the supervisor. If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX. However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day. He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He 
will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could. He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical ! He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that. I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry. The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me. 

I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place.

I've been very diligent in updating the HR coordinator over leaves about what's going on after each appointment, to which I rarely get a response. Then a few weeks after my last check up email that I sent to this HR Coordinator I get a response that's basically threatening my position as I'm not getting better fast enough, demanding I bring in proof of extention by the end of the week. I have no problem with providing documentation for them. I do have an issue with when I ask a HR Coordinator if they have a fax number that I could send this to as traveling is a bit difficult for me at the moment or when I ask about the process of maternity leave I get a three sentence email basically saying I don't know and text me if you have questions. Then when I email saying I'm unfortunately phoneless at the moment til I can get it repaired can I just email. I get no response at all! They say they care, they don't. They treat you like you're lying about everything. They are extremely pushy and have no communication together. I have no doubt she's trying to fire me as with every email she makes it harder for me to comply to her requests. They also refuse to work with scheduling and always have negative feedback. I am a great agent and found the calls to be easy, however due to their pushy you aren't like us or good enough ways I have feared for my job since the second week of training. For example I was couched because my reassure statement had the word absolutely on three calls.

When you ask ""what is the right way to do it?"" They say there is no right way. (but there definitely is a wrong way!) If you don't get it right after the lecture they just fire you.

But the way folks discuss their work, you'd think we were working at Space X. Good thing engineering management is clueless and arrogant, and more interested in engineering by powerpoint than solving real problems. In general, there's a 'not invented here' syndrome which permeates groups, and so a lot of reinventing the wheel. The compensation is bloated, so people are trying to maximize their paychecks. It leads to poor behavior- personal branding is more important than solving problems and petty personal politics and territorial struggles are more important than collaboration. All in all, a great place to get a fat paycheck, but day to day, the work is uninspiring. If you want a real engineering driven culture, led by engineers I'd suggest going to Facebook or Google.

The second part I don't see happening - the women's groups here seem more focused on hiring new women and not as much on helping technical women grow their careers and leadership skills here. This is really a statement on the technical side, because there are lots of women (including visible leaders) in more ""traditional"" female roles (marketing, recruiting, business operations, etc.).

Freedom and responsibility is definitely practiced here. No one will hand you a project, deadlines, and a specific way to go about doing your work. They trust that they've hired the best people to do the job and they leave it up to the individual to identify problems and figure out how to solve them. This sort of environment is not for everyone, because you have to build strong enough relationships with your coworkers so they'd go to bat for you on your projects. Team-building isn't a company-mandated activity here. It's an everyday practice and an integral part of the job.

Feedback is candid and immediate, so get ready. There's no sugarcoating here. To be successful here, you have to be open to criticism, no matter how direct. This, again, might not work for everyone, but it makes your next course of action very clear, as opposed to sugarcoated feedback that leaves you confused as to what you should do.
","Netflix gets a bad rap, because it's not for everyone. The fact is, that's not necessarily a bad thing, and there's no shame in trying something out and seeing if it works out for you. What appears difficult about Netflix is exactly what makes it a great place to work. You have to be able to manage yourself, no one will manage your time for you.

While the company is not as diverse as it could be, the commitment to diversity is something I've witnessed first-hand from leadership and employees alike. The tone is set that diversifying the company is a part of everyone's job at Netflix, not just the recruiting team.

If you need someone to manage your time for you, need your tasks to be very clear and outlined by a manager, or you can't handle feedback, then Netflix isn't for you.

","When the center first opened there was a very employee-focused vibe, and it created a comfortable, positive space while we still did our jobs. While the center is still miles better than your average call center, there's been a big shift to being numbers and metric focused (something we were promised from day 1 of the center opening would not happen) often at the expense of employees and floor support. There's a major disconnect between HR/WFM and what actually happens on the floor, and often we are given no context as to why decisions negatively impacting us are made.

The center here in SLC has also stopped promoting people internally- a majority (if not all) of the supervisors in the last several months were hired externally. This is another example of changing values at Netflix; rather than giving current (well qualified) employees opportunity for growth, they hire people unfamiliar with the process and product, which further impacts the floor negatively.

Wed Feb 03 2016,N/A,, ,"Not high standards, high conformity",33,"Many of the engineers are genuinely good within their bounds. They exhibit a desire to get work done. The tooling is excellent, deployments globally are a breeze, and one can gather great insights from the metrics.

Pay and benefits are amazing.
","Please stop firing amazing talent. Other posts here paint the wrong picture -- that those who survive at Netflix are the best. It is inaccurate at best. The quality of many of those let go is not in doubt, but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability. Many who stay are very bright, but many who are let go are as well.

If you do not tow engineering's backwards line you are looked down upon. People live in constant fear of being canned and this causes them to behave in an immature fashion painting their peers as less than they are. Some seem to delight in the plight of others who are let go -- a mentality of ""better him than me."" It is not survival of the fittest, it is a blind thought police, who speak openly about wanting to hear others' opinions (as long as the opinion agrees with theirs) and then balk when they are actually given. Alternatives are not actually wanted, obedience and maintaining the status quo are. If you are to be disruptive, you must be disruptive in their way. If that makes no sense it is because it is truly illogical.

One can hope this is not so pernicious as to infect every team and I would dare to say that it isn't. But do your homework and know what you are getting yourself into.
Advice to Management
Look inward to a policy and culture that perhaps on its surface appears attractive but hides an ugly story of fear and a need to conform which stifles creativity and achieving quality work. Quality need not be continually sacrificed in the name of ""getting sh** done.""

You were a once great company with great engineers. Stop it with the culture of fear. Just stop it. It does not encourage making the right decisions, people do things to protect their job and high salary, not because it is the best thing to do. It is poisoning the work and you are and can be better than that. Also do not fool yourselves with those who pay lip service to the culture in public -- in private, I have found, they lambast it. Perhaps a retrospective on your culture is in order.

","While one of the plus sides of the debate culture is gathering multiple perspectives on your work, the downside is that you can get slowed down by the need to accommodate a myriad of stakeholders. Marketing leadership also hasn't quite found the right balance of art and science. While Netflix has become an entertainment brand, it should be careful to not set up an organization that acts/looks/feels exactly like a Hollywood company.

Sat Dec 26 2015,N/A,,Customer Service ,Great Product - Great People - Great Culture,8,"The Salt Lake City, UT site is an inbound Call-Center where both Chat & Voice agents help customers with general product questions, troubleshooting and resolving Netflix issues (Accounting and Technical) with english speaking customers only, from all countries where Netflix is available.

You are challenged daily to become better at your job, and you're given the tools and the training to do exactly that! You're coached weekly and your leaders are great motivators and great people to interact with. It's like everyone gives a damn about their careers, and their own personal growth as well as YOUR career and personal growth!

Other Perks: Great wages, 401k, very affordable Health Insurance (after your temp agency contract is over and they convert you to full-time Netflix). The building I work in is pretty great. It's a fun and colorful atmosphere with a lot of 20-and-30-somethings working hard and having fun! Around every corner is some kind of Netflix branding that's related to one of their shows, like Orange Is The New Black, or House of Cards. There's a cafeteria that cooks fresh food for you during the day (Vegetarian options included!). And Netflix covers half the cost of the meals so you can get really great lunches on the cheap! Free coffee (there's even an espresso machine to make your own lattes - also free!). And there's occasionally Netflix swag given out, like windbreakers, water bottles, even Netflix labeled sweatpants! It's easily the best place I've ever worked!
","If you don't give a damn about your career or your own development, you won't last long. The talent pool is also extremely saturated with highly skilled people, which makes it very challenging in terms of promotions. 

Because it's a call-center, there can be a bit of turnover with the staff. This is pretty common for call centers in my experience, and terminations always seem to happen for the same reason: Attendance

If you get terminated for attendance, it's because you were prone to missing work frequently. They will also let you go if you're a tool to your customers on the phone calls you take. A good rule is don't swear at, or start freaking out at them. Follow this and you should be fine. You're graded on your Customer Satisfaction levels and how active you are at putting in the practice to get better. If you're not getting better at your job, or you're not working on the areas where you need improvement, you'll get let go. But your Supervisors are pretty good at telling you exactly what needs work, and they work with you to get to where you need to be. And if you're in any danger of getting terminated, either due to your performance or your attendance, your Supervisors are pretty upfront about it, giving you plenty of fair warning as well as an opportunity to turn it around. Generally speaking, if you get fired from this place, it's because you either didn't care, or you didn't show up.

Mon Aug 17 2015,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Best place I've ever worked,16,"""Freedom and Responsibility"" rings mostly true, although you'd have to be stupid to not realize it isn't 100% true always and in everything. Simple, indisputable example: you can't decide how much you make, yourself. That's an obvious statement, yet it proves there definitely are no-goes and as such, gray areas. In practice, it hasn't been an issue for me--just clarifying. You want X number of monitors, Y super-amazing-computer, come in at 11am, leave at 4pm, take numerous vacations, ask (and receive a real answer!) dang near anything about what movies/shows they're secretly bidding on in Hollywood, etc, etc. Not only things a reasonable person would want to do/have, more like a well spoiled person. This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above average--Netflix does *not* knowingly hire junior, mid-level, or wannabe-senior engineers. I haven't personally seen a bunch of people get fired, but of the one or two I've seen, it was not surprising. I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others.

Like any company of a decent size, not every team has exactly the same culture. Mine was absolutely wonderful day-to-day. My managers help you and coordinate, more than ""manage"" me, which is huge just by itself. To this point, most engineering managers I know of aren't really programmers, which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details. That said, they are ALL very very technical and can fairly trivially smell BS.

Salary: you'll be more than happy as far as I've heard from co-workers. For me, they made it impossible for me to ever even consider leaving because of salary. Almost every place I've worked prior, I had at some point felt underpaid. Not here, I felt very much appreciated and paid as such.

Summary: YMMV, like in every big company, but seriously that's super important to understand, but my experience was amazing and by far the best place I've ever worked, all things considered. I left for personal reasons that aren't related to Netflix--wife/family stuff.
","If you're not a high performer, but you manage to sneak in, the fear of being canned could certainly be real since YOU WILL inevitably be discovered. But don't second guess yourself. It should be obvious whether or not you are a high performer.

Sometimes discussions on the Freedom and Responsibility culture turns sort of cult-like. With a select number of people, questioning its real-world implications has been met with very clear disgust, almost denial. Very rare, though. For me was trivial to brush off.
Advice to Management
Do: continue soliciting feedback both positive and negative/constructive. Do continue to hire top-tier talent only. Do continue tweaking the culture.

Don't: continue having 360s, some how foster year-long feedback instead. Don't use terms or policies defined as ""unlimited"", which is in practice about as ""unlimited"" as AT&T's data plans were in 2011. It makes almost every coworker I talked to uncertain about what it means in practice and of course made things vary among teams.

The culture is all about honesty and really caring about your customers and you can see that. They pay you very well and your paychecks are always consistent. You get five weeks paid vacation, incredible insurance dental and vision, free Netflix and Netflix swag, and so much more. You are treated as an adult and get to work around a lot of positive good quality people. Netflix cares about who they hire, and sometimes those people will lose their job because they aren't the right fit, thus those people come here and leave 1 star propaganda type reviews. If you aren't going to bring something positive to the work place then why are you even there? It makes it amazing to work there because the people who are there are really amazing, high quality positive people making this an extremely great environment . I'm never dreading going to work, the supervisors, agents and even operations management all talk to each other on a human level and no one is snarly or stuck up. Its an extremely chill environment with high expectations. You are expected to do your job and be an adult, and everything else is extremely relaxed.

They have a lot of games and videos, as well as devices to occupy your free time. It is extremely DIFFICULT to get fired. Which means that if you do get fired then you SERIOUSLY and imaginably screwed up.
","Your base PAY as of 2014-2015, as you are contracted out and paid by 24/7 is at the most 12.00 an HOUR! I do not know how Glassdoor came up with $15.

You are verbally abused everyday by the customer. The technology and the Knowledge base can chance on you, so you need to be extremely adaptable.

If someone starts calling you names, you can not hang up and you can not make outbound calls.

You are held to metrics and those standards are extremely difficult to maintain unless you have been working in a call center for 5 years. If you do not perform you will be written up.

One of those metrics is your call back rate, handle time (less than 5 and 1/2 minutes) and DSAT's (less than 4%) which translates into 1 NO in the survey.

Attendance is non-negotiable. I was sick for 9 weeks (I had my voice for less than 25% of the time) and I even brought in a doctors note explaining my situation and I STILL got written up. 

They have shift bids, which means that every 6 months you can bid for a new shift. If your metrics are mediocre or bad, then you will be moved to what every shift they give you. Most places try to put you in shift according to your requests and needs. This is not that place. You can bison your own shift...and possibly keep it. My call center lost half of their work force due to the previous shift bid. They said they were going to try and change it to make it more ""fair"", but when I left, they can completely removed my shift time.

They did NOT tell me about shift bids when they hired me.

If you try for CSR 2 and don't meet the standard by day 90, you will lose your job. You do not go back to CSR 1 or given another chance.

iF YOU want to TRADE, then the person you trade with has to be approved by your team lead and theirs...and vise versa. I switched shifts with someone else, I put up 3 people before I found someone acceptable. The shift took 3 months to process due to a lack of organization.

","There's a reason the benefits package is so great. You will be afraid and you will stress about your job constantly. If you're lucky, you'll be in the right department, but more likely you won't be given really any training. If you do make it past the six month mark without being let go you will only last to about a year or so before you will need to move on. Most of the people you got hired with will be gone within two months and they were all excellent workers. Not okay - scary.

Definitely take the job so it gets on your resume. It will open doors as other companies are starting to pick up on the fact that Netflix is awesome at recruiting (every excellent candidate on a job hunt knows the name and applies), but this company is BAD at keeping these people.

Tue Nov 18 2014, Senior Program Manager,"Los Gatos, CA",Current Employee ,An incredible environment that will definitely make you grow as a professional,21,"I have worked for Netflix for 3 years. As most of reviews say, it is incredible to see how open and honest the culture is. The company is still pretty flat for its size, and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on. Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative. Multiple 6-month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks.

I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment. Yes, there is a lot of work, but I do not feel people get let go all the time, or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason. People do not get let go without fair warning. Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company. I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome people's fears in that aspect. And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined. 

In short, it is a remarkable, fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years.
","I agree there is no career plan or defined development, but then again, this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path.

That person who was new to the company gave me a bad review last year and that's the reason I lost my job.

From my experience, few things have differed from the information available publicly. I was concerned that there would be a 'culture of fear' before I joined but it has not been so.
* Exceptional senior management. They keep the company on course, share information freely, are incredibly knowledgable, and open to answering any employee questions. I have never been more impressed with a senior management team.
* Comp and benefits are outstanding. I started about a year ago and since then the company has increased my salary by over 50%. Having had recent, competitive offers, it is truly top-of-market pay.
* Good work-life balance and unlimited time off.
","* No formalized training or advancement. If you want to try out different teams or roles this isn't the place.
* No long-term career objectives. Nearly every single engineer has the same title so there are no career goals to work towards. This also means no promotions (unless you're in management).
* All engineering positions are based out of Los Gatos. If you live elsewhere in the Bay, commuting is a requirement.

The company values of freedom and responsibility are really like treating employees like adults and trusting them to execute the best overall decisions for the company, which is effective when enough context is given. Innovation and experimentation is rewarded well and many opportunities for ongoing education are offered.
","Internal politics. Lots of blame game behavior played as subtly (yet transparently if you pay attention) as possible. Some managers spend too much time in the code instead of managing their team. I had the experience of offering many recommendations for improving team performance and not having them implemented because the culture here is to just do what you want and either get rewarded hugely or sacked. Management coaching appears to be improving, but inconsistently applied. I've seen people who need to be let go stay on for a long time with many opportunities to change and people who were very competent let go without much warning that they need to change something. I've also seen projects executed that solved the business problems presented but were dropped because management didn't like it rather than some other specific reasons.
Advice to Management
Management is not about process, I think Netflix has that correct. Excellent management is about getting problems out of the way of employees so that they can excel and about managing interpersonal conflicts so that a team can leverage one another's strengths to push the team higher than before. I think this element is missing on some teams at Netflix and that there is too much emphasis on daily high performance (important) and little building of loyalty or camaraderie.

Thu Dec 11 2014, Senior Engineering Manager,"Los Gatos, CA",Current Employee ,"At Netflix the technology is the WHAT you do, providing great content for subscribers to enjoy is the WHY",8,"Netflix is singularly focused. They want to provide great family content for their subscribers to enjoy. By doing that, people feel they are getting the most from their monthly subscription. They have a robust service that is well architected, and they have discipline that has been honed for over a decade to become the best at what they do. As so many leadership books say, you can tell way more about someone by what they say NO to, and how well they can say NO. Netflix doesn't do ads, pay-per-view, purchasable content, or porn. Just thoughtful, edgy, and family programming so you can enjoy your subscription. They're bigger than people perceive, around 3,000 at time of this writing, but still have that startup feel of ""just get stuff done."" They get rid of all unnecessary process, so even in management, I can spend most of my time focusing on adding value to our customers instead of administrivia.
","Netflix prides themselves on hiring super senior people that are like a pro team. Everyone is treated like a professional. You won't find any interns at Netflix. You'll only be working with people that have been in the industry and are smart at what they're doing--but that doesn't mean they're smart at everything. So some coordination and challenging of each other is necessary for success. If you're more introverted and don't speak up much, and not much of a self-starter, this isn't a good company for you.

They encourage personal responsibility, so you're allowed to work the way you like to work as long as work is getting done.

- All teams appear to be very clear and transparent with regards to strategy. I knew exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it and what the overall objective was. Lots of clear communication and collaboration. You think this would be a no brainer for all companies, but this is increasingly rare so it's great to see Netflix embrace communication.

- Plenty of parking in the Beverly Hills office. 

- Catered lunch EVERYDAY.
","-Lack of new employee onboarding for your particular role. When you're new, everyone is really busy so there is rarely time for you to sit down with someone and learn the processes for your role that are specific to Netflix. A lot of it is learning on the fly and asking questions as they come up. This is fine if you're a fast learner or have a lot of experience for your role, but for others this can be a very difficult roadblock that can affect campaigns early on and stifle rapport building within teams

Wed Feb 19 2014,N/A,, ,Culture of fear...and (possibly) loathing,15,"Relative to some Bay Area companies, Netflix pays about 10% to 20% better. Meaning, if you're unqualified, you'll get better pay than someone who is more qualified doing the same job in another Bay Area company. Altho, I hear this is changing and Netflix will only give you a raise if you can find someone in the Bay Area with the exact title and responsibilities who make more. Contrary to the buzz about Netflix being a tech innovator, it's become a ""Hollywood"" company. What drives Netflix is the Netflix ""produced"" shows; not the ""innovative"" streaming technology - Hollywood runs Netflix; not Los Gatos.
","Since many people are only at Netflix for the higher than average salary, there is a culture of fear whereby people are constantly worried about their employment status in the company and will, unfortunately, submit to their baser instincts to do whatever it takes to keep their job. As for a high-performing culture, I guess it's relative but I've worked with much much more talented people elsewhere. Netflix is a great place if you are average and are able to keep upper management for figuring out that you are just average and are willing to do whatever it takes to keep up that facade. It's a less than ideal place if you are truly innovative and want to do amazing ""new"" things. Again, the new thing at Netflix is producing new shows; not technology.

","The Hillsboro call center is shrinking dramatically. Management puts as much spin on this as possible but the reality is, opportunities to advance do not exist.

The ""Netflix culture"" is hyped constantly but is not actually practiced. You will survive if you can speak the buzz words fluently while shamelessly self-promoting yourself at all times and never questioning management. 

Everyone is under tremendous stress to protect their position for as long as possible. Success in Hillsboro depends not on the quality of your work but upon your ability to spin the truth and play politics.

If you didn't do it before hand and decided to work for Netflix and were shocked at its fast pace and rapid change then shame on you. The company is exactly what it advertises itself to be. 

I completely enjoyed the team I worked with and all of the challenges we faced. It has almost been a year and I can honestly say it was a great experience and I miss the folks I got to work with. Netflix has chosen a unique path in regards to customer service and is willing to take new and or different approaches. It is a rewarding experience to generate an idea and have that idea implemented within the same day. Not everything we tried worked but many of things we utilized did work and were very rewarding in there success. If customer service is your chosen profession you can learn a lot from working with this company and gain insight into what would improve an industry that has chosen a path of mediocrity and failure.

","Every call you get can result in a survey with either a ""yes"" or ""no"" if they were satisfied with Netflix.

Anything from people not remembering their password to the website to death threats. You had just 4 minutes to try to make them happy somehow and get them off the line before you got an instant message asking what the problem was. If you had to many ""No's"" you get fired on the spot. Call time too long? Fired. People came and went so much I didn't want to get to know them well because I knew they'd be out the door shortly. I had an incredible team coach that had a lot of faith in me which allowed me to persist in this enviorment. When the whole ""separate dvd shipping and online streaming"" failed they fired him and many, many others. I hung around for 9 months before I quit, the pressure to make metrics was savage and it was estimated that only 5% of the employee's would make it to a full year.

At my youngest, I was a Merry Maid and I even found that much more enjoyable then slaving away to constant surveys, unintelligent callers and unrealistic expectations. Forget about taking vacation- embrace ocassional, mandatory over-time. Expect callers to personally threaten you and your family. Schedules constantly change to odd hours- no matter what your ""ranking"" in the center is. Little or no promotion within.

The survey asks about the company but it's answer is a reflection of the customer service and high DSATs effect job performance. We're expected to convey a relaxed, friendly attitude and build a personal rapport with the customer, but with pressure of the DSAT it's hard not to make everything sound forced and phony because you want to really turn it on to try get a yes out of the person. I'm an introvert so faking conversations and trying to think of chit-chat was hard for me. Do not take this job if you're sensitive and don't have strong conversational skills. You must get to know the person. It is required. I also wanted to add that the schedules and team leaders are constantly changing. It's extremely frustrating.

- Constant threats of firing, a culture of fear and throwing other employees under the bus to save your own skin. The threats of firing lead to crunch and absurd stress levels.

- Employees aren't as intelligent as other high tech firms, they're hired more for the ability to play corporate politics than technical skill.

- To follow on the above, the average stay here seems to be about a year.

Tue Oct 02 2012, Customer Service Representative,"Las Vegas, NV",Current Employee ,Customer Service Rep--definitely NOT Customer Care,2,"-Free Netflix (streaming plus 8 dvds at a time)
-Comfortable Location
-Call center environment laid back so you can wear what you like
-Fun is encouraged (but not easily attained)
-Good Pay
-Excellent fun and Training
","-3rd Party Call center expectations-with Telus International as the client. (Telus is not as ""laid back"" as Netflix proclaims to be so there is a bit of a disconnect there).

-Changes made quickly after start so some training tools were useless such as:
-Have to keep up with 3 different metrics--which is fine except for the Average Handle Time is 5.5 min--which in training was not an issue. This metric supports customers who know what they're doing such as: how to use a PC, know what kind of PC they have, IF it is in fact a PC, aware of any info on their devices. In other words a lot of elder cust may feel frustrated that agent is more worried about handle time instead of providing best cust service experience. Double Digits are not your friend. So trying to troubleshoot a technical issue with someone who is not very tech savvy in under 9 minutes or calming an irate cust because the system charged them even though they deserved a free trial or the NUMEROUS calls for payment authorizations which cause a lot of cust to have to keep double the amount of their service cost on their card at all times

-Technical training is not a requirement but you'll notice most of Team Leads or CSR2's are very techy--which makes for satisfied cust because they may be able to explain why their internet may not be working properly in a confident knowing manner. Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this. 

-You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based. 

-Telus very strict scheduling environment. Make sure your attendance and adherence are on point
-Recording phone calls and allowing you to listen to all your mistakes or rather having a supervisor point out things you did wrong (not much Pos feedback) and write you up for it is supposed to be a method of ""coaching"" but feels more like Big Brother. The threat of being let go is constantly hovering over your head. 
-The position itself seems highly energetic but is unstable--no career focus there
-Turnover is atrocious. which leads to back-to-back calls with no breaks between. Being late or absent on weekends is double the penalty. And the schedule can change without notice.

Also, don't lay off good employees the week they are supposed to be converted. It gets their hopes up and I felt kinda blindsided because I was continually getting positive feedback and was told my conversion was pretty much locked in.

the work was too much but i thought they are paying me more so i worked hard at it.
turns out i had 2 slight disagreements with a member in another team and bammm .....i was gone....

the company has a very simple philosophy....if things are not 100% perfect ...fire and hire ......rinse and repeat........

dont make the mistake i made....dont leave your stress free environment for 10-15k etc because you going to end up being fired the moment your performance falls below 100%

Tue Apr 10 2012,1,"Hillsboro, OR",CSR,The cracks start to show pretty quickly.,6,"Well-paying for a call center, free fruit, cheap soda, a nice building, free Netflix.
","Your work experience almost depends entirely on your manager, and your manager may or may not change every month. Things that one manager may not care about (and tell you not to worry about) will be brought up against you six months later as a final warning. Sometimes policies are suggestions and other times they are concrete, and this will change at random and get you terminated. This isn't just on the ground floor either, one day everything's fine and the next ten managers are let go and their teams dispersed amongst the remaining set (but everything's still fine guys, don't worry). There is almost zero room for advancement, managers are hired in from the outside and the best anyone hired at entry-level can expect is to become a CSR-2, a position that doesn't actually pay more. Anyone and everyone competent seemed to slowly leave for better jobs in my time there, and at first I wondered why when they had so much going on, but eventually I figured it out.

Decent pay if you can stick it out, but way more stressful than it needs to be, and I'm not talking about the customers; an old man yelling at you for thirty minutes because his blu-ray stopped working is nothing compared to not knowing if you're going to be fired that week because you had a sick day three months ago and your calls aren't short enough.

Treat all of your employees equally. There are currently 2 internal sites, one runs using the original Netflix values, the other is run like a typical turn and burn call center. Allowing some flexibility in schedules puts less stress on your employees, also vacation pay and allowing time off would help reduce the amount of turnover that happens and would also keep employees happier and more productive. This would also reduce the cost of having to train more employees. Also taking feedback from your employees about conditions would also improve morale by making your employees heard.

Wed Apr 04 2012,N/A,"Hillsboro, OR","Customer Service Representative in Hillsboro, OR",Absolutely terrible and soul-crushing,10,"Free bananas, apples, coffee. Low priced soda. Free Netflix account. I worked with (not for!) some amazing people. If your supervisor likes you, you will be treated very well and have some degree of leniency when it comes to meeting stats and time spent on the phone.
","Pretty much everything else not noted above. Most days the ""What's working?"" list is shorter than the ""What's broken?"" one.

No communication between departments. Customer service is forced to make things up because the Netflix ""engineering"" or ""research"" teams don't give any sort of information to the reps regarding estimated time to service restoration during outages. I put engineering and research in quotes because, as a CSR, you never actually speak to them. They are merely referenced, like mythology or fairy tales.

Reps are given goals that are nearly impossible to consistently meet, in what I believe to be a fairly obvious system that gives Netflix an opportunity to fire virtually any employee for not hitting their metrics. You basically are there by the grace of your boss, if they want to find a reason to get rid of you it will be fairly easy for them to do so.

The customer dissatisfaction is worded in such a way that many people are leaving feedback on Netflix, not the individual rep, but this DSAT number must be below a certain percentage or you risk losing your job. You are basically encouraged to burn through as many calls as quickly as possible, placating the customer or flat out lying to them (blaming their ISP, home network, or device manufacturer) enough that they'll be compelled to say that they're satisfied after you say ""please stay on the line for a one question survey"" and then promptly hang up on them. 

There is absolutely no way that you are going to have consistent, quality interactions in 4:30 minutes or less, ESPECIALLY after the missteps that Netflix has made this year. But if your numbers drop, or you spend too much time trying to help out, be prepared to be ""coached"". 

Coaching is such an absurd term, because it implies that there is a sort of team camaraderie or human aspect. My last coaching session with my boss involved being told that I was not giving my all. I was only supposed to be a contractor for 59 days. I was supposed to have health insurance by now, and some security as an employee. Instead we are told that they can only afford to hire on so many people, and better luck next time, but you're welcome to stay on as a temp if you like! So yes, I don't really feel like giving my all. Despite putting in consistently good numbers, multiple people on my team have told me (independently) that they are afraid of being fired at any time.

I get the feeling that many people are there only until they find something else. Netflix was actually a considerable pay cut from my last job, but even if the pay was higher the way they treat their employees is at the top of the list of the worst employers I've ever personally experienced. Work / life balance is non-existent. While going through some personal issues in my life, my supervisor told me to ""leave it behind me"" when I walked in the door, not offering anything close to a compassionate response.

One last observation: the people I've noticed who seem to be TRULY happy there are the ones who are too young to know any better. I'm not old by any means, but I'm also not an 18-24 year old kid who doesn't realize that jobs don't need to be like this, that you can actually be treated like a human being and be *inspired* to perform, rather than doing it because you fear for your job on a daily basis. Eventually Netflix will chew them up and spit them out, too. Ask yourself why anyone should give loyalty to a company where an employee celebrating a 6 month anniversary is considered a veteran? 

Also, the positive reviews on here are probably left by Netflix management. It cites things they don't even offer anymore at the Hillsboro facility (like free mac&cheese, and, oh I dunno, BENEFITS for most of the people here). You will most likely be a temp with Netflix (meaning no benefits) until you quit or get fired.

I've been lucky enough to work for some truly amazing companies, and Netflix is definitely not one of them.

I was lured by the supposedly high talent density, solving great customer focused problems and bringing entertainment to people around the world at an absolutely unprecedented scale. I thought that technology would be used to solve difficult problems but in the end the problems to be solved are all around content, content, content. It is fun, though, to work at Netflix. The company is extremely open and transparent with data, decisions and the overall direction of the company. There are no secrets. It is very refreshing to see such an attitude; compare that to Apple.
","Yes, there are interesting things to solve in cloud computing but discovery, search, personalization, and the overall architecture of the Netflix website can only be described as patchwork. The people who are working on these services are stuck in their ways and are protecting their personal little kingdoms. Netflix used to be leading when it comes to personalization and other discovery mechanisms. It has lost its ways and now those areas are a few years behind the competition. 
On a related note Netflix praises itself to have extremely talented people. This might have been the case but the talent density is certainly not the same as it used to be. A lot of the good people left recently and a lot of the deadwood hangs around because they will never be able to get a comparable salary elsewhere. There are the occasional firings going on but that is just scratching the surface. Because Netflix does not believe in career development (active or through mechanisms like 20% time) for their people it is hard to keep up with the competition.

Mon Aug 15 2011,N/A,"Hillsboro, OR"," in Hillsboro, OR",Networking + Not Screwing Up = Another Paycheck,5,"Pay for the qualifications is above average, upper management does a pretty good job of taking executive initiatives (not in sync with reality of call center at times) and implementing them to meet goals with minimal moral-related blowback given the abnormally lofty expectations at Los Gatos. Opportunity to advance and stay challenged for a call-center environment is above average...catch 22 of this is listed below.
","In this company, what you know and who you know go hand in hand. Floor management is given independence to run their teams their way, provided they hit goals and don't draw too far outside the lines. This in some ways creates a public school environment: Some teachers inspire their students...some make them want to drop out entirely. From the top down there is a constant but rather inconsistent level of pressure to perform or face termination. When there is a lull in customer volume, employees are given adequate time and support to develop their skills...if the volume spikes unexpectedly however, external pressure related to the bottom line overrules, and suddenly everyone in the center is under the guillotine again. As an employee that has seen 80% of the center (now 900 strong) replaced with fresh meat in only a years time, and a large number of those let go having equal or better performance than my own (networking is key), it is frustrating to see so much talent go to waste on a regular basis as a result of a supervisor's<team manger's<director's<corp exec's own stress to perform-or-face-a-similar-fate mentality. Going back to the Pros, you can advance rapidly if you make people notice the positive things you do at the right time, because every level in the hierarchy drops like flies.

I made them aware of the fact that I was in school [college, obviously] prior to being invited to the interview, and they said that was fine & they'd work with me (I found out later that this is a complete lie). I went through training and everything with positive feedback. Only after that did it become an issue, and I was constantly pulled aside and berated. I am not going to quit school to slave away at a job that will last less than a year. They pulled me into random rooms around the call center and told me my ""internet browsing privileges were being taken away during my breaks,"" because I looked up Netflix reviews. I was told that my face looked ""sad and depressed."" Well, of course it was after you pulled me into a room 3 times in one day trying to make me feel bad about going to school.

This is by far the highest concentration of smart people I have ever seen at one company and I have worked in Silicon Valley for over 20 years at large and small companies. In addition, not only are they smart but also very helpful and ego free. I read the culture slide deck before I started but wondered if they actually ""walked the walk"". I've found the answer to that question to be ""absolutely"". 

If you are not a really smart, driven person who can operate completely independently and with little direction from management, then you will not be happy or successful at Netflix. There is no hand holding, and expectations are high. But if you are the kind of person that craves lots of freedom and responsibility than you will love it.

In the period of time I've been here, I have personally seen several people get promoted from engineers to managers and from managers to directors. There is a lot of career growth as the company is growing like gangbusters right now and if you are great you will love it and thrive.
","If you are looking for safety and worried that you won't get another job somewhere else, Netflix is not the place for you. Basically, Netflix operates like a Startup company. There is no hand holding, you have to make lots of important decisions on your own, you have to be proactive about seeking out help and information, and the culture is fast paced and filled with lots of people who would be the smartest guys in the room at other companies.

4. A number of smart people get hired.
5. The industry is growing very fast. 
6. Well known brand with instant street recognition. 
7. Facilities are pretty good.
","1. Look at the comments on this site around turnover, treating people poorly, sick culture, and weak senior leadership. These are all very accurate.
2. No training, management training, or development. The philosophy is if you don’t have what we need, we will replace you (i.e., fire you for not being a “good fit”) with someone from the outside who has that. 
3. Hourly jobs in particular have stagnant pay. 
4. There are no bonuses or incentives.
5. The culture has serious problems. 
 a. You will see countless references on this site to a “culture of fear”. This is widespread in every department and division. Even executives laugh that their time is numbered. A company that functions on fear is not a place for the long term. When everyone in a room is asked do they fear being fired and everyone says yes, that is a big problem.
 b. A culture of watching your back and stabbing others in the back. Many employees, including C level people, participate and have learned that tossing others under the bus, keeps them safe. They see this as a way to protect themselves from scrutiny from above. Employees and managers are all too comfortable talking about what is not working with a person. The 360 review process reinforces this. Those who have been there the longest are almost soulless with regard to firings. They have fired or seen so many people let go that they don’t really care anymore. 
6. You can be fired without warning, feedback, or any coaching. Most employees don’t bring any personal belongings to work as they could be let go at any moment. It is often a surprise.
7. Do not move for a job with Netflix. If your partner or spouse doesn’t work, you could be risking your families financial health. There is no job security regardless of how good you are. Performance does not equal security at Netflix. 
8. Managers have a 1 year shelf life before they get shown the door. Directors and VPs are constantly evaluating managers, so anytime you make a mistake, are perceived not to be cutting edge, it could be your turn.
9. HR’s job is to hire and show people the door. HR brags about how good they are at firing people. They don’t help employees, nor are they there to help employees become better. Their role is simply to ensure the company doesn’t get sued and headhunt for all the people that are turning over. 
10. Managers main role is making their team better through constrantly looking for their weaker employees. Leaders are asked could they hire someone better. Of course the answer will always be yes.
11. No severance package is enough to compensate you for disruption in your career, moving, or the stress that comes without having a job. 
12. The recruiting function will hire you fast. The idea is to keep you excited, but if you are reading this don’t get caught up in the Netflix product of movies—look at whether this is actually a place you want to work.
13. It’s incredibly stressful and life-shortening for you and your loved ones. Why work at a place where people, including your hiring managers, treat you as completely disposable?
Advice to Management
1. Change out your HR leadership. They are in love with the culture, but they are creating an unhealthy long term environment. Once the economy picks up you will not be able to treat people as poorly as you do.
2. Change the culture of fear. Install real coaching, feedback, and performance reviews so employees can feel comfortable doing their jobs. 
3. Do some employee surveys to learn the real thoughts of your front line team. 
4. Stop the turnover that is higher than comparable companies.
5. Reed, if you are not a people person, hire some people who are. You will get better performance from people who are not in constant fear of being fired. You can still remove weak performers, but don’t make even your best employees fear for their jobs.

Thu Oct 28 2010,N/A,"Hillsboro, OR","Customer Service Representative in Hillsboro, OR","Netflix as a service is great, but I don't recommend them as an employer, at least, not at the Hillsboro call center.",19,"Like many of the reviews have already said, Netflix does offer some nice employee benefits, especially the employee stock purchase program (take a look at what Netflix stock has been doing, the last couple of years - you'll wish you'd bought in 2007) 

I've met some great people while working there, both peers and supervisors. 

For the most part, customer support is incredibly easy, because the service itself works pretty smoothly. When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.

Unlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome.
","Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros. I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.

Netflix treats employees like they're completely expendable. I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold. The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.

For CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our ""worthiness"" is the DSAT. Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: ""Were you satisfied with the call?"" A ""no"" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play! Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!). Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy. This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps ""gaming"" the system to avoid ""no"" responses. 

Netflix does not give raises. Period. Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance. I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time. So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly. I have *never* gotten a raise. Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.

No paid time off. (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)

Mandatory overtime during the holidays. (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter. And the winter before.)

Extremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.

Narrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position. If that position goes away, so does the person. There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.

TRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far. TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues. They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue. Reps have to tell customers ""someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days."" What happened to ""one call resolution""? There's a guaranteed ""no"" response for my DSAT. Thanks a lot.

Workforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed; we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts. This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.

Speaking of Marketing, they don't seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations. The ""no credit card necessary for a free trial"" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions. 

The same can be said about some of the ""tests"" that Engineering sets up on the website. Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out? I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a ""test"" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the ""test"". Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid ""test result"". There has to be a better way.

The Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion. Many of the calls we get from Canadian customers center on the lack of content, especially newer releases. The Canadian streaming library will grow, just like the US library, but that's not a satisfying answer to Canadian customers. Thanks for another ""no"" response on my DSAT, Marketing department!

The service works so well. Figure out a way to make your human resources department work at least half as well. You are losing good employees at a ridiculous rate, which is going to start affecting customer satisfaction, and ultimately, your bottom line.

There is no clear direction and even though they talk about coaching their people it is not true. The coaching has no impact and people are fired due to not being supported properly. 
There are so many other Supervisors looking for jobs because they cannot stand it there. I cannot wait to get a new job. 
Attrition there is so high. You can see new people brought in and the next few months they are gone. I have never seen a place tat makes so many snap decisions on people which supports the fact that Netflix does not focus on people development.

There is no career growth in Netflix. What you are hired for is more than likely what you will be doing for your stay at the company which on average is only a couple of years. There are cases where engineers / managers morph into something different but it was very rare.

Box lunches are provided but they are terrible. That food is not meant for human consumption. A variety of vendors would be nice.

The unlimited vacation policy is touted as a key benefit but watch out. Constantly changing priorities and short deadlines along with no job overlap means you are going to be able to take that nice vacation to take.

The compensation is skewed in that there are no bonuses or stock grants for the rank and file employees. Insurance for anything beyond the employee ( significant other / family ) will be passed along to the employee. In many cases I've heard this can pretty expensive.

I will say that I did have some good times at Netflix. If you are considering it as a company do your homework, ask the right questions, and make sure you weigh the pros and cons of the environment.

On the next break, she was taken aside by the supervisor (supe) who said, ""I noticed you made it back from break just as I was shutting the door. I just wanted to let you know that's unacceptable. You need to be back from break several minutes early."" (In other words, you really don't get your full break.) She apologized, saying she'd been there five minutes early but had an emergency. He said, ""I'm sure it won't happen again.""

One girl had to call in sick because her child gave her the flu. They forced her to speak to three different people who scolded her, the last of which was the call center manager himself! He said he was going to give her the opportunity to come in for the rest of the week. 

Another girl simply asked her neighbor for a pen during class. She was pulled into a conference room afterward and told by two different supes that talking during class was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated. 

Netflix has a zero-tolerance policy for what they call ""push back"". They touched on this very briefly in class during our second week of training. The example they gave was this: ""If your supe tells you to change something and you say, 'I don't feel like it, so I'm not going to', that's considered push back and will not be tolerated."" Basically, it's outright insubordination. My supe said I needed to work on verifying every account. When people call in, their account auto-pops onscreen....unless they don't give their service code to the automated answering service before they're transferred to a live person. This happens about half the time and it's mostly people who don't have accounts and are just asking about the service. So I asked my supe, ""Is that even when they're just calling with a general question about the website?"" He said we needed to at least ask for a name and warned me that what I'd just said was considered push back but he'd let it slide this time. I was baffled but just said, ""Okay."" The same supe told me he liked that I was resolution oriented because that was a good thing. An hour later, he took it back saying it was bad and I needed to focus on empathy. When I was let go, they gave me the opportunity to give feedback. I mentioned the contradictions I'd noticed and also that I didn't understand how asking a simple question during training was considered ""push back"". I was told that it's all about perception and I just wasn't a right fit. They also said this sort of thing happens often.

Before you go to work for Netflix, ask yourself this: if the pay is excellent and the benefits are great, why is the turnover rate at Netflix so high??? Why are there so many bad employee reviews out there? Notice the recurring themes in the reviews, i.e. lack of respect, no job security, fear based business, no career growth opportunity, etc. There comes a time when the realization that it's not everybody else, it's the company, has to set in.
Advice to Management
Be more reasonable with your employees. Maybe if you applied the same amount of empathy you insist on for call flow to your staff, people would be more inclined to stay with you.

Even during my firing she was on her phone texting. I was given no information outside of a prepared packet and was asked to sign zero paperwork.

Speak to your employees! Don't treat adults like they are children. TM's should give Supervisors the ability to make decisions about their teams rather than having to go through multiple people to get an answer. Give good feedback along with bad. I only received praise about awesome statistics when I brought it up to my supe. Realize that the pool of people in Portland is dwindling and people are aware of how bad the conditions really are.

Customer Service is not simply a game of numbers. As a Customer Service Representative, and as a former Customer Service Manager, and trainer, with a reputable company, who Netflixs' own Michael Osier, vice president for information technology operations and customer service, based the Hillsboro call center after; my advice is to focus generally on the broad customer service experience and not sweat the small stuff. A good former CEO of Southwest Airlines once said ""We can't take ourselves too seriously"" If you're not having fun, and treating your people with decency, the you will have a poisonous atmosphere that is impossible to come back from.

In addition to the above, I found the people there to be extremely unhealthy. Netflix offers food in the break room, but all of it is cheap with high sodium levels and MSG. simply add water, heat and serve. I'll pass.

The drawback is there are absolutely no benefits to speak of (no health benefits, no training, no daycare) so that above market pay gets eaten up pretty fast by real world needs.
","A total fear of failure permeates the ranks. Netflix basically gives you a warning on your first mistake, and then fires you after your second mistake. This is why the annual turnover rate is well over 20%. Since there is an entirely new set of employees every few years, nobody knows what process to follow, and everything is chaotic. HR solves this by saying ""there is no process for anything! Make it up as you go along!"" Sure, if I fired all the employees every few years I'd stay away from process too. 

The key problem is that with all the firings most employees spend the day simply trying to find cover. The ass covering at Netflix is legendary. Nobody wants to innovate. Nobody wants to reach outside their comfort zone. Netflix has created a culture of fear, and the way in which they manage terminations reinforces the culture of fear (they immediately demonize the terminated employee, and try to make the termination serve as a lesson to others). 

The culture of fear is so ingrained in Netflix that many managers only have one tool for managing their directs, and that is to threaten to fire them. There simply is no other process for managing poor performance (remember, there is no process - they will admit this to you if you ask).

And finally, the last thing you should be warned about is their ""high performance"" culture. Their justification for all the firings is that the fired employees weren't high performers. But since there is no process, no record-keeping, there is no objective measurement of performance. So ""high performers"" end up being the employees that get along with the boss and keep a low profile. ""High performers"" at Netflix are not employees that take risks, interact with outside groups, or produce a high volume of work. 

Netflix loves to talk about high performance but they have the lowest standard for high performance that I've ever seen. They are completely happy to manage with fear, however. If you put those two insane concepts together you end up with a rather hysterical environment.

You really need to find the groups at Netflix with the highest turnover and keep those managers away from the streaming business.

As much as you love to say that firing and hiring is what management is all about, you could not be more wrong.

Netflix makes no secret about it's high performance culture, which results in a very high turnover. Average life expectancy in this office is about 2 years, which means very often the main knowledge base of a department exists when an employee is terminated (not always for fair reasons) or chooses to leave since there is no room to grow. There are conflicting values and many managers don't practice what Netflix preaches. If you associate with the right people, this can help your career, but it is disappointing that office politics factors so heavily into a company that preaches how different they are from other corporate cultures. Yes, it's great we all get Blackberries or iPhones (and are reachable 24/7) and have a liberal vacation policy, but the aura of paranoia that invades the office due to the frequent restructurings is not conducive to successful business practices.

Terrific esprit de corps.

The emphasis on corporate values is commendable. 
Customers love Netflix and will give you positive strokes when they find out you work there.

","Follow some of the highly promoted corporate values at your peril -- pure selflessness and candor will get you in trouble during 360 review time. The 360 process is supposedly intended only to help you by providing valuable feedback, but it is used to cull the pack. Elicit feedback on your own well before the review process begins so you have time for course correction. There is high turnover, especially during the few months after the 360 reviews are published. Many are shoved, but many top notch people leave of their own volition. People who seem to be highly valued and an integral part of the work culture will one fine day simply disappear. They hire mostly specialists and maintain a very lean team. Competency alone does not suffice for job security. They will let people go once their project is completed if there is no immediate need for their specialty. They pay very well, but load engineers with high amounts of work. Because the dev team is kept so lean, there is little opportunity for moving to a different group and there are few growth opportunities. It is highly political in the management ranks and lots of jockeying for position, surprise surprise. That is par for any billion dollar company.

Cons
The Call Center is constantly changing. The people driving these changes will try to convince you that it's positive, innovative, progressive. I say those people are just coming up with ways to make themselves look like they're working hard.

Granted, there have been some positive changes. But the recent reorganization that occurred with the latest shift bid? I used to have a competent supervisor who would help me when I needed it and who knew I was competent enough to handle most things. Now I have a supervisor who knows that I've been here two years and that my scores consistently put me in the top 50 performers ... but she tries to get out of taking escalations by giving me ""tips"" to de-escalate and telling me to go back to the customer with some compromise they've already declined. (Gee ... I think I have a good handle on how to de-escalate a call by now. If I'm asking my supervisor to take the call, I've done everything I can and the customer has asked for the manager. Just take the flippin' call, because sending me back onto the phone will just make the customer angrier and make sure they give a ""no"" response on that customer satisfaction survey. Awesome.)

This latest re-org seemed to be completely geared toward shaking up teams that had just gotten into their groove; my old team had great combined scores and even though most of our shifts didn't change all that radically, we all got split up. It seems truly unnecessary.
Advice to Management
If it's not broken, stop trying to ""fix"" it. Change for the sake of change is a waste of resources.

Stop treating your front line employees like they're expendable and they'll become more invested in their jobs. You've got some great performers in Hillsboro who get treated like trash. Give them a reason to stay with Netflix once the economy turns around again, because right now, I'm betting most of us would snatch up any other decent job offer that comes along.

","Netflix is an HR driven company. As far as I am concerned they are the ""bullies"" of Netflix. Nothing is confidential.

Senior/Executive HR staff is crass and they seem to think cursing in front of others and telling lewd jokes is appropriate workplace etiquette.

No-vacation policy (As far as I am concerned, it is a scam). They work you so hard you feel guilty about taking time off. Between the blackberry they ""give"" you as soon as you walk through the door, and the laptop you will receive, you are never off the clock.

The revolving door in this place will literally make you dizzy. During my time at Netflix I can't even begin to count how many employees were terminated or resigned on a daily basis. Senior management even seemed to be desensitized to the large number of terminations. 

No job security. You can be doing a fantastic job one day and the next day you are ""re-structured""

Netflix hires very specifically for each position. They don't want folks to move around within the company trying out different departments - they'd rather hire experts in each area. If the business changes and your role is no longer necessary, you'll leave - they won't try to slot you into something else where you're not the perfect fit, even if you've been there forever and everyone thinks you're great. They don't want to hire an Analyst and see if they can grow into a Manager role - if the role calls for a Manager, they'll hire one in the first place.

This is different and a little more stressful than other non-tech companies I've worked for. But the company is completely upfront about these policies to begin with - there are no surprises. Work hard and enjoy your perfectly qualified and committed coworkers, but keep your resume up to date.

The entire company is very open with communication and treats you like the responsible adult you should be. You will know where you stand at all times and what you need to work on.

Freedom and responsibility is self governing, there is no one looking over your shoulder making sure you are doing your job or tracking how many days off you take. If you get the job done and do it well, you are fine and don't need to worry.
","There is a lot of pressure to always be at peak performance. If you think you're great and you strive to be the best in everything you do, I would highly recommend working here because you have the opportunity to have a huge impact on the business. If you are just looking for a job that you can secure and coast this is not the place.

Use of the eight out at a time membership plan while employeed with Netflix,
Hand sanatizer readily available.
","In May 2009 Netflix took away sick/vacation hours and provided employees an additional dollar an hour pay and then advised all employees to open up their own savings account to save for unexpected days off. Netflix does not have a policy regarding sick days so as to hold it against you when you cannot make it to work (even if you provide a doctor's note). In nine months I called out sick twice and still received warnings not to miss work. Netflix promotes itself as striving to have the best customer service, however has reduced it's training too only two weeks. One week in classroom and the next week on the floor taking calls. The training is insufficiect which leads to inconsistency on the call center floor and the information which is relayed to customers. The turn over rate is ridiculous. I managed to work there for nine months before my part time shift was taken away and forced to go full time. I was not able to work full time due to childcare needs and was told that either I take the shift I am given (which is based on call volumes and business needs only) or I can quit. Netflix refused to work out a schedule that would let me keep my job there and work with their needs as well. Netflix anticipates doing a shift bid every six months, which means there is no gurantee you will be able to stay at the shift that you are hired for, and no room for disscussion. So if you have small children or attend school this is not a suitable job. Netflix promotes a no policy policy environment, which gives each individual team manager and leader to do as they see fit. One day they will tell you you are doing a great job, the next you will be let go. Netflix call center fired employees for not being able to make it to work due to snowstorms that hit hard in December 2008. Roads were not plowed, public transportation was not running, and yet you were let go. People were in accidents trying to get to work. Other's they put up in a hotel to make sure they would make their shift. Netflix had random mandatory OT in some cases without any notice. It wasn't just that they required a set amount of extra hours from everyone, they only had specific hours in which had to be filled. My husband had to take days off work so I could meet their required OT. Again no flexiblity with regards to family needs.
Overall it's just really sad because this job was and could be fun. It's about movies and tv shows and all the great changes that are happening with the internet and instant streaming. Still it is a call center and those jobs aren't always the best, however when the entire company is working so hard against their own employess, the job is terrible. It's not even something you can count on because you don't know when they will fire you and for what.
Advice to Management
Invest some more time in actually keeping decent employees instead of degrading everyone who works there. Most of the employees have college degrees and years of customer service experience. Netflix is known around the world for it's great service. Great numbers and feedback come from happy employees, not from those scared every moment that they are going to be fired next. My answers would much more positive had management, hr and everyone else cared about those that work there. This is one company not hurt by the economy, so there is no excuse.

Thu Apr 16 2009,N/A,"Los Gatos, CA","Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA","Like a good drama: A flashy young company in a nice setting, but with lots of tension under the surface",24,"Netflix has nice, fancy offices in Los Gatos. They have good snacks. They pay a pretty high cash salary. You get to claim that you're in the movie business.
","Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.

Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.

It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.

Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.

Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them.
Advice to Management
The key problem with Netflix is in their HR policies. Netflix needs to establish formal job responsibilities for all employees, establish goals for individuals, and measure employee performance against those goals.

The sense of ownership is big, the challenges are big, and the work is very engaging.

In my experience Netflix has an outstanding team of rockstars, a very motivating group to get to be a part of and work with. 

The culture puts high demands on everyone, and imparts great freedom and ownership in return.

Very data driven, customer focused, innovation oriented.
","The company is very focused, and so brand new areas and opportunities come rarely. There are not a lot of ""arms and legs"" positions, so most roles have both a hands-on and a strategic component to the work.

I wouldn't agree with a review that says long hours are expected, but I do think amazing productivity and results are expected. I view this as more good than bad, but it can feel tough to measure up at times.

Promotion opportunities are rare but they do happen. Most growth at the company comes as growth in ownership, rather than in title.

Worth working for.",3,"You are part of a team that is at the leading edge of a cool entertainment paradym. Reed Hastings, the CEO, is probably the CEO that I have most respected in my career, and I feel he pretty consistently makes good decisions and moves the company in the correct direction. 
Netflix has a very quantitative approach to almost everything, including detailed user testing for their products, so there is a lot to learn about that. The other employees are generally cool people, and fairly smart in general. The user interface aspects of the website are strong, so again, there is a learning opportunity. The company wide meetings are fun, and entail good communication.
","In the website development group, there is two week development cycle. That means that there is a push to the website every two weeks. This has a few consequences. One is that there is a high percentage of overhead (testing and release stuff) compared to actual development time. There is not much time for software design in such a scheme, there is always a rush to hit the next two week time click. Longer term projects are tougher to schedule and short term thinking dominates. 
The performance policy is that anyone who, if they quit, would not be attempted to talk out if it, should be fired preemptively (a hair trigger threshold for firing, basically). This creates a chilling effect in my opinion. I have seen fairly senior management that disagreed with their boss being (farily apparently) fired. This creates a bit of a yes man environment, something that Netflix would deny (perhaps even to themselves). There is very little empowement of employees in real decisions, and decision making is very top down, with the resulting motivation hit that entails.
Advice to Management
Even going to a three week release cycle would help things a lot. The counter argument is that that would lead to more pressure to have inter-release ""patches"", but I think the overhead percentage would drop a lot (like 50%) and that owuld make it worth it (if you don't patch a bug for a 2 week cycle, do you really need to patch it for 3? I think the culture of keeping decision making in a very few hands at the top is working OK because Reed makes the right decisions, but it may prove poisonous if he ever leaves, and it will be too late to turn the cultural tide.

","A career at Netflix can be rewarding and enjoyable, dependent upon whom you work with.

Some coworkers, especially those who have been at Netflix for a longer time are difficult to work with due to stubbornness or hubris.

These attitudes affect the stability of the Netflix service because engineers often do not follow standard operating procedures resulting in multiple outages.

Additionally, some employees make racist and sexist comments and management takes no steps to correct this behavior.

Mon Nov 17 2008,N/A,"Los Gatos, CA","Senior Web Engineer in Los Gatos, CA","Netflix! The good, the bad and the ugly!",8,"Netflix is a place where you are surrounded by some really great minds. I wouldn't even say that SOME of the people are good while others somehow seemed to 'slip' in. If you aren't one of the best in your line of work, I don't think you'll ever get in the door here. I've been here for a number of years and have had the privilege to work with some extremely bright people. As an employee (and part of a team), its good to know that whatever you are working on is going to be top notch because of who is working on it.

Netflix also encourages you to learn and explore new technologies and expand your own knowledge base. At past companies this was always a problem. If something didn't directly relate to what you were working on... well you had to make excuses and come up with reasons why you wanted to try something new. At Netflix, they not only encourage it but really urge you to try to broaden your own skill set.

Our paid time off policy is not to be beat... Netflix has none! No two weeks a year or so many days off for personal/sick leave GARBAGE. Instead, you just tell your manager that you wanted to take three weeks off next month and he says, okay have a good time. We'll see ya when you get back! How cool is that?

Its all about Movies for me. I used to think I was a bit if a movie buff. Yeah, that was until I worked here and met real movie buff's. Meetings are filled with references to movies. In one of the team meetings I go to every week, you can count the number of Ferris Bueller's day off lines.

$$$ Show me the money. Netflix really does pay well! I left my old job doing the EXACT same thing I do here.. the only difference is, I make X2 as much! 

I'd like to write more, but those reasons alone are pretty good.
","When I first started, the head of HR said ""Netflix is a high performance environment."" Often, I feel like they have confused ""high pressure"" with ""high performance"", and believe me, there is a difference. Sometimes I feel like they overly eggagerate the importance of SOME features. I mean, no one is going to die on the table here guys.. its just a movie rental company.

Our medical/health benefits are mediocre at best and HR doesn't seem to care that the majority of employees are totally dissatisfied with the offerings. After constant employee complaints on how high our benefit prices are, HR comes back with even higher prices this year while having even less coverage. I'm not buying the line they fed us either ""benefits are more expensive everywhere across the country."" Whatever.. if I gave that as an excuse why I didn't get a project completed on time, I'd be ""talked to"".

Every year, we have this total JOKE of a per review process (360 reviews). You HAVE to rate your peers and get ratings back from the people you asked to rate you. From my experience, its totally pointless and a huge waste of time / energy across the company. If we spent even a quarter of the time and money it takes to run, manage, and maintain this 360 review process, we'd have double the amount of movies in our Watch Instantly offering.

Don't come here thinking you'll rise through the ranks! That just doesn't happen here. Yes, there are a few people who have started out as individual contributors and risen to the higher ranks but for the most part, I've watched very talented people leave Netflix to get management positions else where and Netflix doesn't really care. When you accept a job here, it will most likely be in the same position for the rest of your time at Netflix.

There is also a very big brother feel here.. Netflix HR is watching you. But maybe that's just me! People seem to 'disappear' sometimes!

At Netflix, many decisions are data-driven. Collecting data to be able to be smart about the business is so ingrained into the culture and so obviously right that, after a while, one is amazed when friends or business partners in other companies tell you that it's not how it works in their world.
There is a great sense of mutual respect among the people who work there. 
Things do change fast, and that can be a bit disconcerting if you don't like the thrill :-). On the other hand, hard, but necessary decisions are made promptly.
If you're at a stage of your life where you want or must take it easy for a while, Netflix is not for you. The pace here does not allow for slacking, and you'll either stand out like a sore thumb, or you're pulled into the race.
","You will be spoiled by all the common sense that wafts through the hallways. 
Netflix is probably not right for you if you're looking for a big title (e.g. ""architect""). The organization is very flat, and there are not a lot of traditional career growth opportunities. However, you will grow personally and professionally even if your title stays the same for years.

Thu Aug 07 2008,N/A,"Hillsboro, OR","Support Staff in Hillsboro, OR",Netflix is Great! ...Just Stay Out of the Call Center.,9,"The upper management of Netflix really does seem to want to take a different approach with how they handle their employees, and accepts the fact that as an adult, you're able to get your job done. They appear to be very with it. The call center attempts to echo that sentiment, and provides many perks that make work an alright place to be. From the free coffee and refreshments in the cafeteria to the free rental plan, great benefits, and competitive pay, there is a great ideal that the company attempts to live up to - that the people populating the center are worth the extra buck or two. It was refreshing to work for a company that was capable of identifying problems, and instead of sweeping them under the rug, took the initiative to change the problem.
","Specific to the Hillsboro location, the middle-management is hit-or-miss with whether or not they treat you like a valued member of the team. Many of the team managers do not communicate clearly with their teams - as a member of the support staff, it was evident which managers were taking the time to coach, train, and encourage their teammates, and which were not. Many reps who were extremely good at their job were let go for seemingly innocuous reasons, veiling the manager's personal dislike for the individual. The Hillsboro center has been open since September of 2006, and very few (if any) original cast members from the first three training classes exist. The management of the call center was not in any way stable; the entire team had been replaced once over, and in the less-than two years, they've gone through two site directors. With all of the management, quality, and training staff adjustments, many representatives felt as though getting promoted was a death knell to your time at Netflix. NOT that there were copious opportunities for advancement - quite the contrary. Team managers were hired from outside of the company, and rarely were promotions from within occurring. There were a handful of people who did move up the ladder, and, as previously mentioned, found themselves restructured out of the company, told that there was no longer work for them to do and laid off, or outright fired because they ""don't fit the way the department is going.""
Advice to Management
To the senior-most management in Los Gatos, I would ask that you send some sort of internal affairs mole into the call center. Hire someone to see what it's like from the floor's perspective, as naturally the team managers are putting on their best face for you. See what their day-to-day face looks like, and see how it compares. Because you very well might see that some of the individuals in places of authority don't seem to know, in the colloquial, their arse from a hole in the ground.

Now imagine the 5 best of those on one team. That's what working on a team at Netflix is like. Frankly, there are no stupid people here. None. Everyone I've met is damn sharp, very sharing of their knowledge and time, and enjoys what they do. 

You are treated like an adult. You are not told what to do. Netflix is laissez faire, not command and control. With that comes responsibility and the potential for failure. If you fail often enough, you will not survive. If you don't expose yourself to this risk enough, you won't survive. Some people might consider this a downside, you won't like it at Netflix if you do.

The Netflix time off/vacation policy is that there is no policy. They don't track how many hours you take. You take time off when you want to, you don't have to ask for permission or approval. This non-policy is one example of many of how thoroughly Netflix expects you to behave like an adult. I've spent many years at big name valley companies. Without exception, everyone of them claims that they treat employees like adults. All of them pale in comparison to Netflix in this regard.
","I'm a developer, and the code base at Netflix has warts that demonstrate its laissez faire culture. There is no architecture group with veto power, so the code evolves organically - I personally think this is great, but it can be frustrating. Luckily, it never stays ""ugly"" for long, but it frequently feels like a ball of mud.

There seems to be quite a bit of turnover. The first month I worked here, I counted at least 5 ""good bye"" emails. At least 4 of them were not voluntary. This can be disconcerting. But this is also not a company like Cisco, with regular annual headcount reduction quotas.

Wed Apr 23 2008,N/A,"Los Gatos, CA","Director, Product Management in Los Gatos, CA",High performance culture; freedom and responsibility within,9,"Freedom and responsibility. You're treated like an adult. You're part of a pro team that is highly functioning. The company is well respected and has a super positive brand awareness -- i'm never able to go anywhere without getting peppered with raves and happy customer comments, and i love wearing company logo gear when i'm out for this reason.

You matter at Netflix. There is no dead wood, everyone is doing something very important to the company or they wouldn't be there. What you are doing matters and makes a difference, and that feels good. You can really make a difference no matter what your role.

The company often repeats that as an employee, you're not on an olympic team -- meaning, you don't do this 24/7 with no life, with all focus on the gold. WE're more of a varsity team, playing to win, very good, but still have to balance with classes and learning. We need to have a good work/life balance and its very important to the company that we do. 

I think the best thing - and its subtle - is this no vacation/no holiday stuff. you work when you work. they seem to realize that everyone is working hard and all the time. nights. weekends often. a ton of hard work. so if you want to take time off for a vacation, a long holiday, a day off, whatever- it happens at your own discretion. you don't ask, you don't get permission. you just do what you have to do. no one is keeping track. i've never heard of this kind of policy and you cannot imagine what it doest for your morale, for feeling like you're being treated like a grown up. For that rule alone I think it stands beyond any other org.
","Netflix is not for everyone. You don't get ""direction"" so much as everyone shares a common understanding of company strategy and goals. You are free to work, and some will find this harder than just being told what to do. Netflix doesn't have ""average"" workers - everyone is high functioning, highly motivated and independent, and expectations are enormous. There is nothing like a career position here. There is high turn over, and its unnerving to many. There is an understanding: ""good average work and productivity does not get a modest raise, but a generous severence."" 

It's a pro team, and the team fit is also as important as the individual performance. You could be excellent, but if you're not HIGHLY communicative, cooperative, egoless, you can get cut just in the team balancing of moving quickly and effectively. 

you must be able and willing to share early and often about everything. projects that are new and forming get debated and you have to defend your position and hear critique well. recognizing that criticism is of the work and not you is essential -- a thin skin won't work well. quiet hard work doesn't work well (for some engineers perhaps); you don't ask permission, but you must be able to clearly articulate why you do what you are doing, and support this position. you must realize that ideas are not fragile, and only through debate with smart people who share your understanding of company goals and strategy will ideas be improved.

This is serious work. It's really fun, but make no mistake, it's hard and not for everyone.

Tue Sep 22 2020, Marketing,Amsterdam,Current Employee ,Amazing...and you will drown in work.,14,"- Amazing colleagues - hard working, smart, supportive
- Strong brand and fantastic content creators, Netflix truly lives and breathes entertainment
- ","antly striving to improve the way we work, extremely agile work environment
- Generous - high monthly salary, good bonuses (option program) and pension, maternity/paternity support, 'unlimited' days off, free food/drink at the office and much more
Cons
- Extremely competitive environment due to everyone being an overachiever. Work is never ending - 24/7 - on weekends, public holidays, during your vacation. I received emails from my manager on New Years eve with an expectation for me to respond.
- Unlimited days off sound great, but when you go on vacation you need to be ready to work. Every. Single. Day. Nobody will take over your work or help offload when you are gone, it's up to you to make your work happen. Since I started 2 years ago I have checked my email every, single day. Including on my sisters wedding. 
- At any moment you can be given a new position at the office, that you might not want or need, but it's part of the constant change that is Netflix. If you don't accept it, your services are on longer needed.
-...or even worse, you will be laid off. I've seen amazing people being let go because their manager didn't feel they were 'engaged enough' - as in, they wanted a life, disagreed one too many times or the reasoning was even more vague.
- It feels like most that work here just go with the flow. If they keep their job one more month, great, if not...well they made some money and it looks good on their CV. 
- Generally you don't have any work stability and you need to be ready for that i.e. never knowing whether you will have a job in 3 months or not. 
- Maternity/paternity leave for a year never happens - if you get 2-4 months without having to worry about your job then that's fantastic. 
- If you have a family, and children, have a good long think about what matters in life before accepting the offer. I am 'lucky' to not to have kids, just a very supportive partner, and I still feel like the worst person ever at least 1-2 days per week (as I just always cancel outings with my partner and/or friends because of work). I see parents struggling weighing the glossy work that is Netflix vs their love for their children vs being able to buy that fancy bag or car. It's heartbreaking at times.
Advice to Management
- You are amazing in so many ways, but please try to see that workaholism and pinging on public holidays isn't cool. 
- Sitting in a meeting while you are extremely sick (Covid/flu, vomiting etc) isn't inspirational.
- Telling your staff that 'being burnt out isn't real/it doesn't exist - it's just the staff member being lazy' won't make us work harder. 

Finding balance in work and life is what makes us creative, what makes us passionate and what makes us happy. Netflix has changed so much in the past couple of years and for me the journey we are on is to change the world with our streaming content, we want to engage and spark joy - all around the globe and without prejudice. Please don't lose sight of what's important, and the positive impact we have on society as a whole (including the well being of your staff), in the chase for money alone.

","Netflix as a company constantly says it is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, and do not tolerate “brilliant jerks”, or bullies. Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises, they would often side with the individual of higher rank. 

In my 2 years at Netflix, I’ve noticed that you don’t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company, you just have to be the loudest, and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones. 

Directors are often bullies and brilliant jerks, somethings sans brilliant - they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good. 

The director I am working for for example, often makes me solve director level problems. When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is “not my problem”. However if the problem was successfully solved, they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough. 

Netflix encourages weekly 1:1s with your cross functional partners and direct managers/directors, and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions. My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff, if too many questions were asked, they would be threatened with termination. 

Another issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job. Hiring of dynamic individuals is great, however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings. No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals, on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience. What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego, play politics, gossip, and take everything too personally. The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok, results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girls/boys culture. 

HR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it, but nothing ever gets done. In fact, employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues, because more than often HR would side with the upper management, brand the victimized employee a “trouble employee” and eventually they will be let go. And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work, which most of the time is completely false. It’s almost always politics and power play involved.

I have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant, hardworking and true stunning colleagues. A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening, their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage. 

How much you get paid also depends on who you know, and how much you know how to “charm” your bosses and the leadership team. I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors, because they are great with charming their bosses. How they determine how much each person gets paid, does not depend on experience, skill. It depends on friendships, and how well you sell yourself. 

The money and benefits are great, but they also come at a very high cost. If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment, then this is the company for you.
Advice to Management
It’s about time you put your words about not tolerating brilliant jerks, and your fair place work environment regardless of rank into action. Leadership often close their eyes on offenders due to them either being great at being part of the big boys/girls club or the fact they are of substantial rank. If this isn’t addressed you will keep losing your true stunning employees and be left with the ones who sound great but can they put their money where their mouth is.

","You can be scheduled to work late shifts 3 months in a row which is super exhausting and depressing (you’d finish at 11pm if you’re lucky)
Back to back calls on busy days, you won’t have time to take a breath and have a sip of water
If you’re late too many times, you’re fired
On coachings with your team leader you’ll hear only about areas where you need to improve, there’s a lot of pressure. They want you to be perfect 
They keep telling you that feedback is important and they care about it but at the end they don’t do anything with it 

Don’t get sick, don’t go on sick leave (psychical either mental sickness) otherwise your contract won’t get renewed. They will take care of you during your sick leave, arrange a reintegration plan, support you and tell you how good you’re doing and when your contract is about to end they won’t renew it. They will lie to you that your performance (you can check your performance yourself) was not good enough and let you go or even tell you that they cannot risk you’ll get sick again. They won’t even explain what exactly went wrong in your performance. They will offer you recommendations for future employers and even help with finding jobs. And they will add more to it, for example that you’re complaining about being scheduled for only late shifts. We have a special swap market for shifts since so many people are not happy with their schedules. 
Since Netflix switched to Majorel in April, a lot has changed. They are checking the average time of your calls and how many customers have called back after they contacted you. 
Basically, Netflix doesn’t like sick people, they don’t accept mentally ill. You need to be healthy, not complaining and always on time. Otherwise they’ll tell you you don’t fit.

You can change shifts with your colleagues 
You can watch Netflix during work 
Free Netflix for a year and longer if you stay in company
","There are days where you have a lot of calls so it might be a little bit intense 
If you don’t set your preferences or if they won’t get accepted you can work 3 months or more in a row only late shifts
There is a LOT to learn, the two week training prepares you for only the most common issues customers call about
From time to time you’ll get some abusive customers

You get a voucher for your Netflix account.
","The employee surveillance is beyond good and evil: there is a camera every couple of meters and you get an electronic key that you have to use where ever you go, so every movement you make is tracked. Although Netflix advertises itself as a company where you are encouraged to take responsibility and be innovative, there is actually no trust whatsoever that they put in you. You can only grow in this company if you sacrifice your dignity and act only in the companies interest. There is an atmosphere created that doesn't allow you to be direct and open. You can give feedback, but don't expect that anything will happen or change to your benefit. You'll be told ""That was great feedback, thank you!"" and then they keep following the companies agenda again. There is no transparency from the top to the bottom and decisions are often made with no consideration of the preferences of the employees. You will be expected to work different shifts and on weekends and you will see your weekend days being cut off when the schedule changes at the end of the month, so be prepared to work more than 5 days in a row without compensation for the weekenddays they have stolen from you. You pretty much don't have a life anymore. If you face sexual harassment or verbal abuse from the customers over the phone, which happens almost every day at least once, you may get 5 minutes to calm down, but there is no help provided for your mental health. You really start feeling like you're not a human being but only a number that has to be optimized. Most important thing if you consider working there: Check the work law of the country so you know your rights. 
Netflix seems to work a lot on their reputation but what they do inside the company is a shame.

Laid back office atmosphere
Assuming you last half a year you will obtain monk-like patience after surviving the coachings and meetings
","-Monotonous job. Seriously you will lose your mind after a month. It happens to the best of us.
-Difficult upward advancement
-If they could pay you less they would. For example, management finally boosted employee compensation to barely surpass their competing call center only after bleeding agents left and right to said competitor for months
- The management shoves company values so far down your throat but typically follow some and ignore others themselves when it fits the moment's narrative
- Very cliquish environment, if you don't spend your time outside work with colleagues you can forget a chance at a promotion regardless of your ability or achievements
- MASSIVE turnover. The requirements are fairly straightforward but after a month or two, colleagues begin to drop like flies
- Assuming you have general people skills and the ability to arrive to work on time there are no new skills or training provided to advance your career outside being a more efficient Netflix agent.
Advice to Management
Rather than hiring outside and spending months getting new managers up to speed, hiring from within selecting those individuals who demonstrate exceptional ability should be promoted. Seeing there is a chance to advance one's career would provide incentive to stay with the company longer thus reducing high turnover and a constant need to find and train new employees.

","As few people said before, don't treat people like toys.
Got hired for the ""dream job"" which became a total nightmare shortly after the training was done. Lots of coaching sessions are important for improvement, yes indeed. How about coaching makes you feel like the worst and useless person instead motivate you to improve?, you come back to home and you wonder ""what did i do wrong"" Improved everything and two days later you have another wonderful coaching session where you hear : You don't fit here, you are fired.

The best thing which happened to me at this company was getting fired with a silly reason like ""Communication skills"" (also can agree with a review, which was posted before here).

Well, from my side, that was the worst experience I've ever had.

- Use their values in order to push a political agenda. If you do not work 100% conform the values, you will not have your contract extended.
- Meetings go on forever. Everyone needs to have a say on a particular sort of topic without any concrete actions being taken away.
