* Co-workers are generally pretty nice. People seem to like the work they're doing. 
* Any equipments needs you have are met pretty readily. Software is slightly harder to get a hold of--but can still be done. 
* While pay is not the best, pretty generous bonuses. 
* HP is my first place, but I get the vibe speaking to others that the meeting load is pretty light here. Tend to prioritize people having the time to do their work rather than having them sit in long, pointless meetings.
","* Managers tend to set unrealistic deadlines. They don't expect people to work overtime to meet these deadlines, at least not that I see--but it does lead to a lot of unnecessary shifting and shuffling of schedules. 
* It definitely feels like there's a strong tilt towards male-identifying employees. Would be nice to see more gender diversity in the workplace.

","Little room for creativity, Large company, lots of corporate BS such as layoffs due to stock price fluctuation, progress is slow. Getting a good manager can make or break your experience. A lot of employees in their early 20s and 45+, but little in between. Get ready to be a powerpoint engineer. Heavily focused on a dying industry (printers) with little drive for innovation. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. HP Corvallis will often layoff engineers and hire them back as contractors for less pay, and they can do this because Corvallis has few other options for engineering jobs. Little respect for computer science and therefore the infrastructure is lacking.
Advice to Management
Pick the best employees for the job, not someone with amazing credentials in general who's experience doesn't fit the position. On the flip side, also hire people if they have the credentials despite them not having an engineering degree. I often heard managers talk about how if a tech wants to be an engineer, they really need to get an engineering degree, despite them having more than enough experience to do the job.

","In any large corporation (>5k employees), politics exist between lower and mid level managers.

The opportunity for free meals and incentives, from technology suppliers, no longer exist as there are now caps.

","The corporate environment is cold and abrasive. HR, for example is nonexistent. Everything related to you as an employee is what you see on a website or email. Need to talk to someone about your insurance or paycheck? It's all outsourced if you can even find a number to call. The current environment is one of constant offshoring and divestment in engineering capabilities. Closing down sites, outsourcing development. So sad to see such an amazing collection of talent get scattered to the wind. No hire back policy, so if you do get the short stick and get laid off there is definitely a voted off the island feeling, even though everyone knows it was mandated downsizing and not based on performance.

","Trainings are out dated and need updating to educate and correctly onboard. The gender wage gap is 100% real (same degree, experience, job title results in a difference in $10k in salary gap between men and women). Compensation for commission is a mess; at times, pay out for sales commissions don't hit your account for 3 to 6 months after sale is completed. When management asks sales how to improve strategies/tools/processes, the common response to any suggestion outside of what they want to hear is ""there's nothing we can do ,"" all the way up to director level. This site and the teams within just float, lacking any initiative to propel themselves forward, design anything new, etc. Toxic work environment, full of gossip and teenager mentalities; your manager won't watch the clock but your peers will on their behalf.

Tue Oct 20 2020, Software Engineer,"Boise, ID",Former Employee ,"Good work/life balance, low salary, concerning trajectory",0,"HP Boise had great employee groups(I loved participating in the Young Employees Network and Volleyball leagues). The work/life balance is generally good as you'll find the parking lots mostly empty by 6. The overall engineering culture is still quite good, especially if you get on a team working on a new exciting project.
","Unfortunately, there are quite a few reasons why I wouldn't recommend pursuing a job at HP right now.

There have been significant layoffs with various teams in the past few years. The company claims it's invested in Boise yet the headcount has been on a steady march downward. The high-end firmware, low-end firmware, and cloud(Roam) engineering teams have been gutted at various points, with work moving to Vancouver, India(""the Hub""), or Korea(ex-Samsung). This has also led to significant attrition of top talent. Of my entire ""generation""(5-10 years), almost everyone I know has left.

Simply put, you won't get the best salary at HP. Comparing salary notes with former coworkers, you can expect a 25-30% better salary with other companies in the area(Intuit, Cradlepoint, Kount, Micron, etc). 

The overall direction of the company is perpetually depressing. Let's face it -- printing is not a growing business nor will it be in the future. The trend is that every quarter the financials are either flat or declining. HP has already saturated the printer market. If you're not getting a great salary, why work somewhere that's on the decline?

Advice to Management
HP is not the company it pretends to be. To management: Look in the mirror, honestly see yourself as a company and either make the needed changes so the reflection is accurate, or tell people who and what HP really has become. 

This is especially true in the PC division, where 6-day work weeks with 12-14 hour workdays are common and ongoing. Endless slides and presentations go in circles and do not move the business forward. The politics are dirty and I've never seen such backbiting among employees, mostly out of fear. Maslow's hierarchy being what it is, people spend an inordinate amount of time managing up, sometimes claiming credit for ideas that aren't theirs. I have seen a large degradation of integrity and Open Door most certainly is dead. 

There has been little true innovation in some time, which is not surprising in these circumstances. The quality of HP products has been on a steady decline and I believe this is linked to the degradation of the culture and values. At some point, it is going to show in the products. I was stunned - in recently looking for a new AIO laser monochrome printer - to find HP way down the Consumer Reports list, at #12. 

The pay is fine and benefits are good, but there is little opportunity for advancement and work/life balance is non-existent. HP talks a good talk about diversity and I believe is really trying to bring in a diverse set of people, but it is only ""skin-deep"" without inclusion. By this, I mean a company may hire more people of color and more women, but once they're hired they have to conform to a certain cultural norm - a white, male, corporate culture norm. Cultural and style differences are suppressed to fit in. So no, you can't remotely bring your whole self to work, just pieces. I realize this is a very difficult hurdle and challenge, but HP pretends that it's achieved inclusion, when that is not the case. Again, time for an honest assessment in front of that mirror. 

Oddly, there is a strong bias against the Boise site and Boise employees. This was expressed by Carly Fiorina, when she mentioned roadkill in association with her trip to Boise, and many times since by people from other sites who seemed to think Boiseans were lazy and not very intelligent. Boise is home of the LaserJet, on whose coattails the company rode for a very long time. There are so many brilliant people at HP in Boise because that is where they want to live, not because that's where they could get a job. Writing this as someone with an Ivy League undergrad and high honors MBA from a top 10 US business school who could - and has - worked elsewhere but chose Boise for my home, that is narrow-minded and just plain...stupid. I have seen that unfounded bias grow in recent years. Inclusion, anyone?

I left for a position with another company, where I have found the differences striking. My creativity has powerfully re-awakened, my work is appreciated and I honestly love my job. To any job seekers reading this, please be careful and thoughtful about where you go to work, and I wish you all the best. You have a unique contribution to make in this world.

","Managers are selected for any other reason but what they contribute to their team. I saw three managers all get hired for either quotas, career brownie points, or because they were friends with the director. All lasted less than a year before being fired and a lot of people quit off of those teams that were competent employees. You also run into a culture where people don't care to work hard, it is easy to hide within the corporate conglomerate without contributing to the bottom line. There are a lot of egos at play and office politics is expected, you have to kiss butt to get ahead, certainly not a meritocracy. Also, and this is HUGE, they don't like to pay their employees in a timely fashion or accurately.

","Job descriptions today have lower overall requirements than the identical role demanded several years ago and salaries are lower than the average. If you're of the mindset that starting at a lower overall salary and working hard to build your reputation will set you up for an extraordinary, long-term career, you could be disappointed. 

HP values their shareholders. Lower wages across every category became a priority when former CEO Meg Whitman recognized that the company was an inverted pyramid, rather than a conventional pyramid - with fewer people at the bottom than near the top. 

The average wage in each category today is less than the same position paid in 1990. If you stay in a job role long enough to be at the top of the position's salary band, its very likely your job will be eliminated in 18 months or less.

You may also endure ""penalty for performance"". Quotas are not based on averages or pipeline likelihood but rather on the last six months plus management's agreed growth percentage - e.g., if you have a rockstar fiscal half, your next quota will be set at the record breaking sum plus an increased 9-15%. The reality penalty is virtually zero commission and an unattainable quota, leaving your employment stability vulnerable. 

There are only 500 Fortune 500 companies - beware if you have the ""good fortune"" of closing a double digit, multi-million dollar purchase. A closed ""special hardware project"" in one fiscal half on paper becomes the expected run rate computer hardware expectation.
Advice to Management
365 performance reviews are a good idea. My manager used input from my peers in my reviews where he had knowledge gaps. It would also be beneficial to use this review style to include team insights from team subordinates to grow management. 

Quotas need to be satisfying and demand challenge, however penalty for performance can be avoided when quotas are grounded in business intelligence, rather than last half number plus a growth %. Growth could be measured by new logos with business taken from the competition and run rate with new category adds and new product lines of business.

","Significant glass ceiling. They will fight you if you significantly over achieve comp. Toxic work space.
Operations teams worry more about following contractual terms to a t, rather than understanding and working customer needs. Customer sat matters.
Finally, internal cost structures are ridiculous, creating competitive contract pricing is stuck in HP Infrastructure of the 90's.
Advice to Management
Look to create diversity at all levels. Require Directors and Managers to move to new roles, empire building kills the business. Leadership stagnates. Learn how to develop internal tools in 6-8 months, rather than 6-8 years. Hire more people so the field teams aren't completely shredded. Go back to a customer first mentality. Actually care about and deliver on the customer's needs.

Advice to Management
HP is a slave to its high margin Supplies business and they have been unwilling to disrupt it - even a little. They have been so slow and unwilling to disrupt it that they would not budget properly to sell printers. And what happens when you don't sell low margin printers today? Yes, you guessed it. You don't sell high margin supplies tomorrow. And now those chickens have come home to roost. Layoffs of 7k-9k employees most likely on the print side coming in the next couple of years. HP has lost its way by hanging on to the old way of doing things. They don't innovate nor do they do what it takes to retain top talent. Fresh young talent is not offered stock. Get those golden handcuffs out, HP. Make it rewarding to stay and hard to leave. But without stock, anyone can be tempted to leave for nothing more than extra pay because we don't have to give up anything to go. By giving stock to everyone you will make it a lot harder to leave. These things should be obvious but only make HP look cheap. That's why HP is nothing more than a good company, not a great company.

Fri Sep 06 2019,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Good people, stagnant thinking, uncompetitive salary and benefits",2,"It’s surprising when you run into some very sharp people working at a stagnant legacy tech company, but really, there are very good people to work with at HP.
","For a company that has focused on essentially 2 things forever, it’s unsurprising that change is hard. However, with all the profit printing cartridges have rung up over the years, HP management and CTO really failed to ever invest in the “next business.” 3D print may become a good business over time, but it cannot be the only business. For a company that has the muscle and makeup for building hardware, HP has been inept at acquiring or home-growing any growth businesses.
Advice to Management
You have to make some calculated bets. 2D print is not going to return the same revenue and profit over the next 10+ years that it used to. Acquire a complementary hardware company in a growth area - is it a POS company, a media streaming company, an IOT play... I don’t know, but I’m hoping you do. Whatever you do, don’t go for anymore value plays - I.e., a company on the decline - palm was a garbage buy, Samsung laser printer business was mediocre. Be bold, be creative, let’s gamble now while we still have the chips rather than just die a slow death by 1000 tiny cuts.

Also, you really need to take a hard look at your management. People unwilling to change, stuck on the old ways, wanting to play it safe, cut them. Complacency is a slow-growing but fatal cancer that will kill a company. HP still has time, but that window is closing. Changing business structures isn’t addressing the issues, it is just kicking the can down the road.

Sat Aug 10 2019,N/A,, ,You’ll be just another cog in the gargantuan HP machine,0,"1. People. Coworkers were almost always great. 

2. Flexibility of work schedule. WFH and flexibility in working hours was great. 

3. Pay. I’ve yet to get a job that pays me even 64% if what I made at HP. 

4. Benefits Package. (PTO + insurance + retirement)

5. Company-provided equipment. (Laptops, monitors, etc) 

6. Empathy and compassion from management (depending upon your individual manager) if something tragic or traumatic happens. After the death of a parent, my boss let me take four weeks of paid bereavement leave that didn’t come out of my PTO balance.
","1. The culture created by management. You’re just a cog in the gargantuan HP machine. HP cares not about your hopes and dreams or your career advancement. Even if you push hard for something like mentorship, which is something they promote, your requests will likely be ignored or pushed aside. 

2. Adherence to the bottom line creates job instability for employees. Sudden and unexpected layoff occur. I was “let go” and given fake reasons why. What it came down to was that I was laid off without HP calling it a lay-off so they didn’t have to report it, which would have been detrimental to the stock price. 

3. If you get laid off or let go, you won’t see it coming. I had a one-on-one scheduled with my manager. As we were walking to find a conference room, we chatted like it was any other day. Just chitchat. Then we walked into a conference room in a different building and he immediately hit me with the news I was being let go. When I questioned why, he gave me a made up reason related to my performance. When I challenged him and told me he was incorrect, he fumbled over his words and gave me a different reason that was equally made up. 

4. Lack of interaction with management. In the nearly five years I worked at HP, I can probably count on two hands the number of times I had real interaction (something beyond chitchat) with the two different managers for whom I worked. 

5. Also, if you accept a severance package, as I did, you will never be eligible for rehire. EVER. After working for HP for 4 years and just shy of 11 months, my severance package was a half a month’s pay, but no one ever told me I’d never be able to come back and my severance paperwork never indicated as much, either. 

6. Favoritism. This is definitely a problem. My first manager took the words of another person I worked with as the God’s honest truth when that person blamed me for a mistake she made. My manager never even asked me if I knew anything about the problem created by this other person. She just automatically assumed the problem arose because of me. I was told “you set us back weeks” after this other person mucked up some data she was analyzing for a new metric. This other person had asked me to look at the data and run a test, which I did exactly as she asked me to. I ran the test on literally 100 rows out of 100,000 rows for approximately 15 minutes and didn’t save anything. My second manager played favorites and I felt as if I had been “left behind” (for lack of a better term) while the other new hires I worked with were brought along much more quickly than I was. The other two new people on the team were given special treatment and paid special attention that I wasn’t. It helped if you were an athlete of some kind or if you liked mountain biking. That helped you “fit in” with the little clique created by my manager. Apparently I didn’t “fit in” because I didn’t join them on their mountain biking trek or their whitewater rafting trip one summer.

","It's luck driven. If you are lucky to have good management, everything is great. If you have the bad luck to report under a bad management - good luck. Pressure is high especially when the external environment is bad - this leads to bad executive managers showing their lack of understanding of the business. Bad decisions then lead to very bad things happening for the business, for the employees, and then finally themselves. HP used to pride itself for paying amongst the leaders, no more. Previous hits like the audio oscillator, calc, hp3000, inkjet, laser, etc... will not drive the company into the future. The recent breakup into HP Inc, HPE, and DXC... not sure if that is smart. The HP way has been flushed down the toilet in recent years, especially in Asia.

","No snacks or drinks, no cups to drink water, free coffee that sucks, bad cafeteria, lack of motivation since they are slowly shifting everything to Houston and Taipei. Biased management - they will have parties on other site but ignore Palo Alto. Salary hikes are joke (1%-2%), bonus mostly 3%, if company does well (which is rare) then 5%. Minimum internal promotions/growth - they just hire people from outside to be managers, lots of layoffs every cycle. Extremely negative environment to work in - all my friends slowly got laid off with no replacement.

Bay area is the birth place of HP. Please try to preserve it. Value your loyal employees who have worked years for you, instead of laying them off with poor severance package and benefits.

","During my tenure at HP Inc.'s Vancouver office, I witnessed increasingly poor quality of employees and behavior that ended up making this the worst workplace I have been a part of. Although tolerable at first, it seemed like a variety of antisocial behaviors and ongoing harassment were commonplace and becoming worse to the point where I developed serious concerns with the ethics of the company. Based on my experiences towards the end I can't recommend anyone work for this company or support HP Inc. in any way, especially if you are differently-abled. I would not feel at all safe allowing my child to be an intern at the site I worked at and it scares me that people as young as high school age were being exposed to this environment. 

The workplace itself could be described as dingy, crowded, and cluttered which did nothing to help the generally poor environment. HP seems to have fully bought into the idea of a temporary workforce and what seemed like constant restructuring and employment thrash made this a particularly soulless place to be. The best, most talented, and generally nicest people tended to do their time and leave, to be replaced with ever-poorer quality people in a depressing race to the bottom.

Thu Apr 18 2019, Business Planning,"Spring, TX",Current Employee ,Current Iteration of HP (not HPE) has a great ethic and culture,0,"First, it's nice to be in a leading company in an interesting industry that is culturally relevant. Culture is very supportive and cognizant of inclusion and recognition. They also treat you like an adult, and as long as you get your work done nobody is really clock-watching and you have flexibility to manage personal needs with business ones. I'm an old timer, going back to the Compaq days, and the current work environment is the best I have experienced in my 20+ years with the company.
","No macro level cons, but as I am sure it is with any company, an individual job or role can have drawbacks: Some require extensive travel, since we are an international company some require calls at very odd hours, emergencies regarding product quality or supply issues can break out which can translate to very intense periods of long days until the situation is resolved. I'm sure there are some turd managers here and there, but from what I have seen they are not tolerated very long and get sorted out. But there are no overall ""Company Cons"" that come to mind (and keep in mind, I am an old Coot and usually pretty cynical, so for me to be this positive says something!).
Advice to Management
Keep up the good work. Appreciate and support the movement to try to bring younger talent in the company, but be sure to continue to value and recognize wisdom and experience of your experienced employees. I would say challenge your mindset on what business we are in....it should not be viewed as the ""printers and computers"" business....we are in the ""image and information"" business and so developing new products/services/opportunities should flow from that mindset(e.g. people haven't stopped printing as many pictures...people have new ways to view images. There are more new images created now than ever before...what can we do to make these accessible to people?). It is like the old standard that people don't buy drills, they buy the ability to make holes.

Also, working around some very talented people encourages growth. For newer employess, HP can be a great learning opportunity working alongside these veterans. After about five years, it is usually time to move on to another company where you can have some assurance of more steady career paths.

Upper management strives to provide solid financial stability to the company.
","Upper management treats the workforce as interchangeable cost units that can be moved from country to country. This means that you can be layed off (WFR) at a moments notice regardless of how talented or how much you contribute to the company. The depersonalization is such that people are not really called people by management they are called TCOW's(total cost of workforce -- permanent) and RCOW's (resource cost of workforce -- contractors). When the word comes down from on high to cut your TCOWs you have to do so regardless of how good the people are that are working for you. As you read the reviews you will notice a very different set of reviews depending which country the review is from.

Management creates quite a bit of PR about how they value talent within HP, but the lack of training and/or apprenticeship opportunities to develop people into new or changing roles is almost non-existent. It is pretty much limited to the occasional quarterly class on management processes or access to Linked-In learning. There is tuition reimbursement but it takes a serious commitment to a program before you can use it.

It is clear that the stock holders greatly out-prioritize the work force.

","HP has shown an increasing inclination towards outsourcing work to 3rd party houses or their China campus. Many jobs are being sent overseas while qualified Americans are being caught up in ""workforce reductions"".
There is no stability in HP. In the 10 years I was there I went through multiple restructures and mass layoffs. HP has a tendency to alternate between contracted labor and permanent employees with layoffs in between. 
If you are contract, be aware there is a forced 3 week unpaid shutdown during Christmas.
If you are perm, be aware that if you are caught up in one of HP's workforce reductions, there is a strict no-rehire policy. In my case, HP just purchased a new campus in Spring TX and was preparing to move to the new building. We were all assigned desks and I actually bought a house and moved my family closer to the new campus. Two weeks before the building move a large group of us were ""reduced"". We had all been given excellent reviews, the budget seemed fine, and the reason given was a need to ""refresh the talent pool"". We were given a severance package and 60 days (during a forced holiday shutdown) to find a job within the company. Since most of us were unable to obtain new positions that quickly especially during a forced shutdown, we are no longer able to work at HP either as contractors or permanent employees with no timeline restrictions. Take caution if moving your family!
Advice to Management
HP is an American company that should invest primarily in supporting the American workforce. Please do not continue to send jobs overseas just to reduce the bottom line. We keep hearing about how great HP is doing as far as market share and finances but so many jobs that could be filled locally are not, all for the sake of the budget. 
I would also suggest reviewing the post-WFR no-rehire policy, especially considering HP's campus move to a much less central to Houston location.

Deadlines are tight, scope is high and resources are low. There is no development at all. One has to wait over 15 years to get a promotion and salary raises are below 3% at best. 
A lot of experienced employee are complacent because they won’t get fired. They don’t add value to the teams and get away with doing the minimum.

Mon Apr 09 2018, R&D Manager,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,HP way now is alive,0,"HP has a fun atmosphere at work, it is very team oriented with everyone working towards a common goal. There is the opportunity to work on great projects with tangible results, and learn every aspect of the product development life cycle. HP offers a good benefit package, flexibility on work location and possibilities for growth within the company. Furthermore, opportunities to try different roles within HP exist via job rotations.
","Employees need to be self starters, there is training and mentoring, but a lot of the training is on-line and the onus to learn and grow is on the employee. This is not necessarily a down-side, but this company is not for those, who are not self-motivated. The work is done in very open/modern environments, which foster collaboration, but because of this there is not a lot of privacy. Again, not necessarily a downside, just something to consider.

I have been here for a little over a year now, and have held 2 role, advancing into my second role 5 months ago. I came into HP after working at another company for the past 3 years that treated their employees terribly, especially the women. Since coming to HP my entire life has changed. I am so grateful that I can say I wake up every morning and am excited to come in to work. HP represents everything I believe in - diversity, family/work balance, flexible hours, positive work atmosphere, great leadership/management, and employee engagement activities/events with all employees on site. HP is a breath of fresh air for me compared to where I was at. I am very excited and looking forward to where the rest of my career within HP will take me.

If you assign one person a goal but hold another person accountable - that is what causes politics. It is not usual to see it in the sales teams (they have clear goals) the BUs, Ops and Labs teams have these problems, depending on the leader. More coaching from HR experts on how managers should set and track goals would help - it varies a lot and HR is too under resources to assist at the moment.

","Strategy to drive all work possible to offshore locations. Unfortunately, this increases the stress to onshore people who have to mentor and train the offshore labor. It is very hard to take ownership for an extremely interesting project without it being fractured across timezones. The result is a very exhausting schedule between daytime and nighttime meetings. It is not uncommon to have a 14 hour start to finish day (with gaps in the middle).

","Pay is low and promotions are hard to come by. You will get small 2% raise every-other year and bonus. It all depends on company performance, and how much funds your team is given. If you are in a good performing team and your manager is given money then you will have no problem getting a 4% raise each year, but it is really all out of your control. Ineffective and incompetent people are not fired. There are a fair amount of lazy people that are just coasting here. That said there are some bright people here but they are few and far between. Upper management is incompetent and comes up with stupid project ideas that you have to implement against your better judgment. We used to have various year round celebrations but management cut those back. There is really no career growth potential unless you want to grind out 10 years. Once you pass entry and intermediate you land into the career plateau knows as specialist. It will take five years to get to the next career ranking, unless you leave and come back like so many do. On top of that, every 18 months or so is a company re-organization, which sometimes includes jobs going over seas.

","HP Inc is a big, big company, so there is a major challenge for leadership to realize even the most worthy company-wide programs and goals.
Advice to Management

Fri Apr 13 2018, Software Engineer,"Vancouver, WA",Current Employee ,Stay away from the inkjet firmware lab,1,"- At the very top of the company, things seem okay. We have a Chief Diversity Officer (Lesley Slaton Brown) that is very smart and articulate. Catherine Lesjak and Enrique Lores are top notch minds, as far as I can tell. However, they seem really bad at actually getting their middle managers to execute on their vision.
- Work life balance is good on most teams (unless you have to interact with other timezones often).
- Benefits are good by most corporate standards.
- You can be super lazy and still work here for years. Seriously, there are managers making six figures that do literally nothing.
- People care more about being nice than getting work done, which if you are a sandbagger is great.
","- Don't work here if you are a software engineer (embedded or otherwise), they don't value software because almost no one in the management chain has a software background.
- They are always happy to offshore software work to the lowest bidder, and then act surprised when the quality sucks.
- The Inkjet FW lab is a complete shambles. They have hundreds of firmware engineers scattered all over the globe (some who are downright incompetent), a mountain of technical debt, and almost no velocity due to this combination.
- People care more about being nice than getting work done, which is awful if you want to get something done in a dysfunctional organization.
Advice to Management
Clean up the Inkjet FW lab. Stop sending work overseas to the cheapest engineers and/or contracting houses that you can find, you aren't saving any money in the long run. Make sure that all of your engineers at least have a cubicle to do their job in. The office situation in Vancouver is embarrassing.

Thu Jan 11 2018, Software Engineer,"San Diego, CA",Former Employee ,Not a good place for engineers,5,"People treat each other very well. This culture is protected and promoted. San Diego is a nice place to live.
","Low compensation, after a while I was able to get offers from top tech companies and they were like 2x-3x better. Company looks ridiculously poor, it is a big problem to spend few thousand dollars on hardware and software, management tries to outsource as much as possible to poor countries, benefits are no good, tiny amount of vacations. Holiday parties are lamest that I've seen, they're held in the office and food is not always catered. Very few strong software engineers around, a lot of managers that are completely not qualified in tech, most of them either worked as managers their whole life or have marketing background. I would say that there are some dishonest people in the management as well and they're not going away and even get promoted. Bureaucracy is staggering, IT is a joke (we had like 100Kbs internet connection most of the time) and it is impossible to get anything from IT or HR departments, no amenities in the office, cafeteria is really bad (it was improved after renovation, but it is still pretty bad). In innovation departments work/life balance is pretty bad as well, you will need to work very hard to make something from that little that company is providing you with.
Advice to Management
Currently HP is in the negative feedback loop. Engineering achievements are not rewarded, company loosing good people and becoming even less attractive. Maybe that's fine if HP wants to become entirely branding and distribution company. But in this case I encourage engineers to seek better place to work.

Raises are rare and small, with performance being rewarded occasionally with the possibility of annual discretionary bonuses the amount of which depend on business conditions and management's whims. I saw my workload increase every year as people would be let go and not replaced with their duties just heaped upon the remaining workers.

Huge amount of office politics. The different business units do not co-operate and act like separate companies often in conflict. When making decisions like supply chains or data systems the overall good of HP rarely mattered, only the effects on their own business unit were considered by the business unit's management. 

Lack of C-Level leadership. No vision. Seemingly countless expensive and ultimately pointless, money losing acquisitions (Palm $1.2B, 3com $2.7B, EDS $13.9B, Autonomy $11B). HP culture is ossified, slow to respond, and resistant to change

There will always be a bottom performer even if you build a dream team of previous high performers. These people become a target for getting laid off instead of instead of letting people go because their skill is no longer needed, they are a true low performer, or cost reduction.

Pros
HP is good at promoting a work-life balance and everyone from VPs to custodians are friendly. Very flexible if you need to work from home.
Cons
Too many meetings! You could have a full schedule just listening to meetings. Also, HP isn't the place to work if you want management to take notice of you or take advantage of your strengths as an employee. There are a million different roles at HP and no one to help guide you to the one that best fits you. Employee success must be guided my management.

Functions at the facilities, mainly put on and organized by employees, but the company does add some to it. Can sometimes work from home, but this is largely used to get 12-16 hours a day and weekends out of people.
","The running joke at HPI among thousands of employees is, ""The work / life balance is that work is your life now. That's the balance"". Prepare for required overtime, required working on Veterans Day (even if on a Saturday or Sunday), required working every single day straight for 19 days in November including Saturdays and Sundays in many departments (although not all). It's not a one time event, they actually plan to do this every single year. If you do not work overtime, you cannot keep up with workloads as they purposely plan to give more work than employees can do in 40 hours. Required working through vacations! Even on vacation, most positions it's required to check and respond to emails, even do file work for your position. I have never once had a real vacation off and a couple of them turned into regular 12 hour working days that I never even got to see my family except at dinner. Very strong political views. During the election I received more emails from executives about how evil and awful one side was than I did about HPI. It was depressing that I had to be bombarded at work constantly.
Advice to Management
Stop the lip service and actually try to achieve a real work/life balance. You say words, but you don't follow up with any management to ensure they actually are doing this.

To be fair, we were a mid-sized, scrappy company, so some reduction in speed would be expected. But we also saw a lot of needless delay and disinterest in the things that our company got right. Don't buy small, profitable companies if you don't know what do do with them... My sentiment has been confirmed recently, as this company was sold off from HP several months ago.

For the first time, there is a strong identity and razor-sharp focus on core strengths in the PC, Print, and Solutions businesses. The result is the strongest product portfolio I've ever seen from HP and the freedom from having to be all things to all customers.

HP has a great legacy in the industry and Silicon Valley. It treats employees and customers with honesty and respect. It's a company that you can take pride in working for.
","The famous ""HP Way"" culture has largely disappeared. The current culture isn't bad, just bland.

Highly consensus-driven culture means lots of meetings and difficulty making decisions. 

Many product/projects are split between multiple teams and/or business units. In some cases, you have to go all the way to a senior VP or even the CEO to find a single executive with end-to-end authority. This can slow decisions and lead to misaligned incentives between teams.

","Last quarter the company returned all free cash flow in dividends and buybacks. That does not leave much for R&D. 
Pay bands in my BU are very misleading because even average folks earn less than average pay. Mgmt says that is the norm. Overall pay seems a bit lower than the industry.
Currently compressing folks into smaller cubes with short walls and small group spaces to be more inviting to younger employees is the claim. Employees are expecting high noise levels that will reduce productivity.

We get nothing from stockholders. We do not buy companies with stock and the stock bought on the market does not pump money into HP. Given the continuing buyback plan why cater to the street that drives up the share price? Start investing in the company and employees instead of Wall $treet. CFO has got to go.

Mon Feb 20 2017, Senior Engineer,,Former Employee ,Struggling to Regain Basic Management and Leadership Priciples Required to Suceed,1,"There are some truly great technologists working for this company that are highly competent and have high integrity. These true leaders are technicians working on the shop floor to Fellows working to influence corporate strategy so that HP can win now and over the long term.
HP Inc has tremendous assets from the legacy handed down across many generations of outstanding contributors. When focused on innovation and contribution, HP is truly capable of changing the world in ways no other company in the world is capable of.

There are a few managers that are high quality, skilled at their trade, and working hard to do the right thing for HP and their people.
","Unfortunately, as with many companies that experienced high growth through the 1980's and 1990's they have driven the company into a protectionist position. They are now led primarily by program management and finance principles of avoiding risk and rewarding those that avoid risk. There is no real tolerance across many of the current HP sites for delivering true innovation and contribution to the world. There is a lot of talk, but the actions of managers from the lowest level is completely contrary to that required to foster an environment of success. To paraphrase a senior technologist that left the company a few years ago - ""I will be rewarded more highly if I do the wrong thing for HP"". I hear this same concept from many of the top performing technologists - the ones that actually deliver concrete contribution. Another senior technologist lamented the layoff of an engineer critical to the success of several projects while other engineers failing to provide any contribution other than sucking up to management are retained.

The result is that top performers are leaving - and as you can see from the financials, HP Inc. consistently fails to produce the contribution required to sustain growth. I left HP recently because I was offered a much better opportunity and because I knew that I would be more highly rewarded at HP if I did the wrong thing for HP. I would not do the wrong thing just to gain a personal reward.

Some Key Issues:
At many sites at least 80% of the first level, 50% of the second level, and likely 50% of the third level managers have no real experience in leadership. They have jockeyed their way into these positions because they could not promote by any other means. They are politicians and bureaucrats that care little for their people or for HP. They do what they need to do, to protect and advance themselves.
Management does not know how to recognize contribution and consistently rewards low performers that suck up to management.

Very few managers know what their people do or the significance to the business. They were not competent as engineers, technicians, ...etc - so they have no idea what competence or excellence is.

At some sites significant hiring of new college graduates is in progress. Unfortunately, at some sites this is accomplished by laying off older competent employees to make room for the younger employees. It is too bad to see a company that used to be the best technology company in the world to work for resort to laying people off to make room for younger people. This is how you create a toxic work environment. You need to win new hires by being a great company!

The toxic management climate is detrimental to work life balance. With years of layoffs and managers protecting themselves at the expense of their people, the culture is poor in many areas. One technologist commented to me that he was thankful for a long commute so that he could decompress from the environment before he got home to his family. Unfortunately, many other people of integrity do not succeed in decompressing and end up taking the toxicity home with them.

The top talent leaders and innovators are leaving many sites because they see little future for HP do not feel like they can do their best work at HP.
Advice to Management
The problem at HP is the management team. Most of your PMs applied for PM positions because they wanted a promotion and had no chance of promoting on the technical career path. This is true of many section managers and directors as well. You will not succeed or thrive with the management structure you have in place currently.

If you want to help the team succeed you will restructure the leadership teams with a focus of promoting people into management that want to take on the responsibility of leadership. This requires having a desire to empower people to succeed - not focus on preventing them from taking calculated risk. This requires having a desire to win - not a focus on protecting themselves. This requires a desire to hire and reward the best - not a focus on undermining people trying to produce at their highest potential so that they can protect their position.

In general - managers need to be “A” level players that reward “A” level players and help “B” and “C” team players become “A” level within their abilities. 

You will hire leaders that are competent to lead their teams, care about their teams, and care about customers. They must have a passion of making a positive impact on the world!

Do you have the will and strength to change and transform the organization?

If you do have the strength - the power to unleash disruptive contribution to the world and grow faster than you can imagine is yours.
