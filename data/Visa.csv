","Be careful about some people there. They can stab you from behind and pretend that they are your friends. The management is just doing the minimum to keep their job in the bureaucracy. A bad place for young professionals since no one cares about your time there. 
I was stabbed by someone from behind, and then the management put me on a PIP program without admitting that it was a PIP. However, leaving Visa allows me to find a better place without these politics and dramas.
Advice to Management
Be a little bit caring and encourage open communication. Acting and pretending is not good for you. 
Also, please don't make up excuses when you try to fire someone by saying that they cannot perform your mission impossible PIP task.

Advice to Management
I worked under a senior director who cared more about years of experience than proven work history and performance. Guidelines in terms of career advancement can be helpful, but if they are hard and fast rules people who are capable of developing skills faster will lose their motivation to keep trying if they know they can't get a promotion for x number of years, or until x number of years in their position have passed regardless of performance.

","Reorgs happen way too often resulting in strategy changes every year or sooner.

I've seen a VP yell at my coworker in front of me many times. Often blaming him for not doing something when it wasn't even a priority. My own manager has yelled at me as well in front of coworkers. Is that really appropriate? Is this good management?

There's a major communication gap between VPs and what they really want versus what we're working on. Typically the VPs barely know what product we're working on. They're only concerned with their personal projects. 

Raises and promotions are almost impossible if you don't get to work closely with the VP on their projects. We'll see the same folks being promoted.

One VP even wanted his group to donate to a company he's on the board of. Super awkward.

Wed Jun 17 2020, Senior Director,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Bureaucratic, Heavy Handed Managers, Popularity-based Reviews",4,"Al Kelly who is the CEO is absolutely the most amazing leader and has made many positive changes to Visa. 

There are some very amazing people with smarts and outstanding experiences. Working along side of them is gratifying.

The pay and benefits are exceptional and competitive with other companies in the Bay Area.
","Visa used to be a fun place to work. It was very collegial. But sadly, that has been lost. It is now a hyper-competitive, bureaucratic ""meritocracy"". You are graded on a curve. Only a small handful of people can be highly rated. If you are not highly rated then you do not get a very good bonus and possibly no stock awards. The review system is based on your popularity among your peers who provide feedback, and that is used against you if you are not popular; regardless of what you factually delivered to the company. The feedback is completely subjective and based on personal opinions. Different managers use different criteria. Some managers collect the feedback and keep it secret from the employee. Other managers tell their people to collect the feedback themselves and then share it with their manager. Obviously the quality of the feedback is going to be different when it is anonymous. Some managers even follow up with a more probing investigation to gather more negative ""improvement opportunities"". There is no standardized set of criteria used and there is no consistent way of rating people's individual performance on the criteria across the company. It is all totally subjective. When review time comes around, morale drops because people do not like being unfairly judged and know they have little ability to get an above average review unless they win the congeniality award or the big boss likes them.

","No emphasis on career growth - you can be in the same role for years and management will continue to be vague on the path to jumping a grade level even if your performance has been outstanding multiple years in a row. No change or reaction from management when employees state that their workload is unmanageable and their overall well being is being impacted. Management is almost entirely male-run and promotions tend to be prioritized for those that are friends with managers versus those who are delivering results for the company. Organization seems to never have funding for promotions - these are promised with no action months and years later
Advice to Management
Empower your customer support organization by setting clear milestones to promotion and supporting employees with their long term career goals. Many in the organization have been doing the same job for 10+ years and don't provide value, likely because they have stopped caring about performance because there is no discussion around career progression or opportunity expand skills. If funding promotions is an issue, there should still be more conversation around employee's long term career goals and setting milestones to move on to different roles (even if they are outside the org). We are also seriously lacking accountability, and expect the high performers to fix other's mistakes. The org will continue to lose good talent if things continue to run this way

","Too much politics. ""Visa Principals"" are terrible. They expect every engineer to act like a publicity manager of his/her own and make sure you're known if you want to move forward, which is a bummer. Engineers don't work like that, management does. Unfortunately the leadership thinks otherwise. Peer feedbacks are used against you so you get a lower rating, irrespective of the work you deliver. It's the engineer's responsibility to find opportunities and then step on it to move forward while the management just sits back and applauds whoever can pull it off. Rest of the team can go mind their own business. This is an awful model to work with.

","There is no opportunity for growth for call center agents. There is a lot of micromanagement and zero care for the employees. Sometimes it is even compared to slavery, agents are only given 4 minutes a day for personal use such as bathroom use and they can get in trouble if they go over the four minutes, otherwise they have to be forced to wait until their breaks. Getting vacation is almost impossible. VISA does not care about the customers, is just about making money. Call center agents are measured with ridiculous metrics almost impossible to achieve, is more about getting rid of the call ASAP so that you can take the next one. They laid off over 90 people that had been working there for years without even caring about the time and energy people invested in the company. Call center agents are looked down by people on other departments. People apply to other positions and they are rejected without being given an opportunity for an interview. There no open door policy, even though the company claims there is. Their leadership principles (values that they claim to have) are a joke. They do no lead by example, they do not communicate openly, they do not collaborate with others. They claim that at VISA everyone is a leader (that is another joke). Everything is given to the person who has connections. It is truly disappointing.

","-Terrible management: If you are working as a contractor, management will almost treat you as if you are not human. Calling out sick 1 day after 5 months of work without a miss caused the managers the next the to state my job was ""on the line"" and if I happened to miss another day before becoming perm I could lose my job. In addition, management can be condescending at times due to your status and will even poke fun at your salary while boasting about their high paying title.

-Very stressful working environment: They will squeeze those 8 hours out of you, no downtime, most of their schedules do NOT give you 2 days off back-to-back so forget about resting too much or planning a weekend event.

","Diversity - Visa must be the least diverse workplace I must have worked at in my 20 year career. Engineering is mostly filled with sub-par engineers with minimal skills that were contractors with some IT bodyshop at one point and got converted to employees. Most of your time is spent dealing with internal politics or drama with very little interest from your peers about actual work. 

Culture - Peers are super nice to each other but will speak negatively behind your back with great ease. Every one shares everyone else's compensation, performance ratings, upcoming promotions, family matters freely without any concern for privacy or feelings. This is across all levels of the company, all the way to top management. Most people hang out in groups to socialize with peers that speak the same language. 

Strategy - As an engineering org, there is no sense of direction There is absolutely no strategy from the top that cascades down to the front-line employees. All-hands meetings are a joke. 

Process Burden - Processes are archaic and there is little interest in changing anything. Most employees are stuck with long immigration waits and are bullied into working long hours and weekends. Things that are done in a matter of hours or are automated in the rest of the industry take weeks or months here. There is absolutely no respect for work-life balance. You are expected to answer texts, phone calls, IMs at any hour of the day or you are considered to be not committed or hard-working.

Focus - There is also always some new flavor of the month. Some new security tool gets introduced that opens up a bunch of findings on your application and you 
spend the next 2 months chasing those findings. Or there is some massive migration effort that your org needs to undergo and you spend most of your year just moving all your applications and data to a cheaper vendor. You are then questioned on why you didn't get anything important done.

Morale - Most mid-level management got beat up due to poor employee survey numbers last year. Managers spent most of their energy in addressing engagement issues versus getting anything real done. Individual contributors were asked to be more engaged and that was the end of it. Apparently this year, it is not a priority anymore and somehow things have made a 180 in terms of engagement. 

Growth - When it comes to career growth, promotions are done mostly on favoritism or tenure (need to be around for decades) and there are no formal career paths. Internal Mobility is talked about all the time but there are no protections. You apply for a role and you would be lucky if you even hear back from the hiring manager in months. You are then told eventually that the position was opened to fill an internal promotion.

Performance Reviews - The performance review process is a big mess as well. Visa uses stack ranking and will force your manager to put someone on the top or worse, below every year. Then HR forces then their 'curves' and the rating that you get is something else altogether than what you were expecting or deserved. Your manager has very little say in your performance.

","A recent incident at VISA Austin - where an unknown person slits the tires of many cars and most of them I know are Indians. Where did this hate came from so suddenly ? I don’t think it exists before. 

Apparently in last few years - VISA has been flocked with lot of Indians and many at Senior leadership as well. This same crowd now exists at VISA are those who invaded EA and tried to spoil the culture and diversity of EA with nepotism and closed mindset of 90s working culture. Luckily they did not stay too long - but did enough harm to system in that span. I remember those mean days. 

I would surprised if the same flock people acted maturely at VISA - could have avoided this kind hatred.

In order to keep employees motivated and reach service levels, acknowledge their hard work and don’t threaten their jobs because that will only cause them to deliver poor performance and leave the company. The company should work as a team so it will continue to have success.

Wed Apr 17 2019, Infrastructure Engineer,"Highlands Ranch, CO",Current Employee ,"They pay well, but they really don't understand how to make people happy.",22,"Pay is good, bonuses & stock benefits are also very healthy. Insurance, 401k, that kind of thing they have on point.
","Severe mismanagement, it's impossible to get anything done. 
They think they get it, but they don't. 

For example, they give employees cheap, low quality equipment. I, for example, was a senior level IT engineer with a mid-six figure salary, and I was given a $400 laptop to use for four years. 

Another example: they moved to open office. I don't work directly with anyone who sits near me and there are tons of empty seats on the floor, yet we have an open office set up for some reason.

Finally, you can't work from home. Apparently they don't trust people to do their jobs unless they are sitting in an office building.

Basically, Visa is happy to ignore employee well being, productivity & efficiency tools in order to save a small amount of money.
Advice to Management
Spend money on facilities and equipment. People need to be comfortable at work, and with regard to employee comfort, Visa might as well be 1965 IBM.

Sun Apr 21 2019, Director,"Foster City, CA",Current Employee ,Solid mature company,1,"- Mature company with huge market power behind it
- There are different departments within Visa that can cater to many different interests that employees have
- Solid pay that is comparable to what one would expect from a company of Visa's scale - but it won't make you rich
- The company stock is doing well.. Clearly, the Senior Management is doing a good job. Unfortunately, mid level employees do not get much of this stock compared to companies in FAANG or C/D series startups.
","- Sometimes need to navigate politics and bureaucracy.. Not unexpected from a large company.
- Won't make you rich working here, but solid pay
