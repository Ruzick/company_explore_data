","Management is terrible. CEO talks a big game on D&I but everything breaks down at management level. Middle management sucks! They had so many reorgs they are running on bare bones with both people and dollar resources. They have affinity bias to hire and advance those that look like them. Senior leadership is too busy to manage their middle management. HR only worries about saving company from lawsuits. Employees of color have no support or advancement opportunities. Company tried to listen to its black and brown employees recently but failed to take any action because they are afraid of reverse racism and lawsuits. I wont encourage anyone to join J&J at this time.
Advice to Management
Hold your middle management accountable to D&I. Start measuring interview slates, training dollars assigned to white vs. colored employees, promotions of whites vs. colored employees, do an annual 360 of all director and senior director people leaders and use employee feedback to hold them accountable!

Mon Aug 17 2020, Engineer,"Santa Clara, CA",Current Employee ,Mediocre Pay and Benefits,4,"* Many smart and talented coworkers
* Some of the mid level managers are great.
* Interesting product
* Stable company
","* Pay is low for Bay Area.

* Limited healthcare plans. After acquisition my open enrollment options reduced from a dozen plans to two plans.

* Don’t expect any stock rewards unless you’re management.

* No investment in individuals – long term incentive plans are tied to impossible milestones

* Lots of talk about the Credo, little in action. 

* Upper management is in a different world and seems indifferent to the concerns of the rank and file. No transparency whatsoever. We ask many questions during our weekly calls, but few ever get straight answers. Some don’t even get a response, and answers are rarely written down or recorded so you have to rely on management to not change their opinion.

* Constant pressure to go into the office, even when you’ve stated your health concerns with COVID. You’re an essential employee if you’re R&D… better to be an engineer at a company where you can work at home.
Advice to Management
If you want to attract and keep talent in the Bay Area, you need to offer a reason to stay. Your talent is jumping ship rapidly. If you believe in the Credo, make your employees shareholders as well. Be more generous with your stock options, pay, or benefits, or we’ll be in other Bay Area companies soon enough.

Work life balance is promoted heavily and there are flexible work from home days that help achieve that.
","Difficult to get through the interview stages because of the number of applicants they receive. Additionally there are normally roles that open up that end up going to internal candidates - if they are qualified.
Advice to Management
Since I have been here, Management has been more open with their plans for the future - please continue to do this as it helps individuals know that they are working towards a common goal.

Although training is promoted, the company normally will not pay for specific certifications in the IT field. I believe promoting the idea of having employees be certified in their respective technologies would be a huge benefit.

If you happen to be in a protected class, then this is your Golden Ticket. The best pat about the leadership, is that they rarely stay in one position long enough for you to get tired of their theatrics. After they move along the next executive will come in with some wild plan to bring change and you just pull out your work from the last 2 graduating classes of leadership and sell it as revolutionary. Wash, rinse, repeat and you are on your way to the retirees winner's circle. Be sure not to rock the boat in your last 5 years of retirement and collect as many direct reports as possible because you will need to shave a few off every few years to make it look like you are being efficient. To soften the blow of the news, just call it something harmless sounding like ""Transformation"".

Potential for some very good experiences but highly based on your manager and area of the organization. It can be a good company. Avoid the Medical Devices sector like the plague.
","The CREDO is nothing more than some words carved in granite as most leadership ignores most of the tenants and act in direct contradiction of them. Employees are encouraged to speak up however it's window dressing as there most definitely will be ramifications for doing so. The culture in the Medical Devices sector is toxic and leadership is extremely poor. I can't speak for the Pharmaceutical or Consumer sectors however. Leaders who implement failed strategy after failed strategy resulting in poor growth and reduced revenues just get shuffled around into different while they constantly cut lower level employees to compensate.

","Paygrade limits nearly every opportunity available. Its extremely difficult to work your way up through the ranks; and it may be better to leave and come back since internal experience carries significantly less weight than external. For example to be considered for a position, your paygrade can't be more that one or two positions removed from the one your looking at; regardless of what you actually do and your actual experience. You would then need to also already be (titled) in that position, since they only ""hire the best"". Which in there eyes would be someone who already has the experience and title; again regardless of internal needs or considerations. Its not so different than many other companies in this way; to help ward against nepotism. But that and the paygrade ceilings hurts professional growth. I've had several rotational bosses in a positions I would be eligible for except for my paygrade.

Sat Jul 13 2019, IT Lead,,Current Employee ,Huge career runway if you are willing to put in the effort,3,"The Credo. If you don't know about J&J's commitment to The Credo, I suggest that you stop reading now and go research it. The Credo lives in everyone I have worked with and is the driving force for all decisions that are made in the company. 

Benefits, work-life balance, compensation, very intellectually stimulating work, and opportunities at every corner. If the density of your work is great and the quality outstanding (that doesn't mean if you work 50+ hours per week) you get to choose what you work on and can pivot to new projects very easy. There is opportunity to travel in the IT sector which gives you the ability to network, connect, and learn about all of the different business units; you get to see how your work in IT is impacting the lives of millions.
","Some might see this as a con, and thus why I have included it in this section. 

No one is ever given anything in life and the same goes about promotional and advancement opportunities. If you are not willing to put in the leg-work to manage your goals and objectives, educational opportunities, certifications, etc., then you may find it difficult to advance in the company. I see this as an opportunity to advance one's self starting skillset. Advocation and self-starting are critical attributes if you wish to advance to senior leaderships. 

As with many large enterprise companies, there are politics at play. A good understanding of psychology can help mitigate this.

","Science, business plans and even patient safety take a back seat to kissing your bosses behind.

Senior managers control parts of the drug discovery business where they have no academic knowledge, no work history and no knowledge or understanding of the regulations, but they do have friends further up the corporate food chain.

Hiring & promotion is done on the basis of how much you agree with you boss, not on qualifications, merit or effort.
Advice to Management
J&J has a set of values called CREDO; you should either show that you believe in those values or dump them. BOD should review ALL senior management hiring decisions to prevent senior managers from hiring their unqualified friends from former companies. You currently have many very senior managers in drug discovery who are totally unqualified for their roles resulting in terrible business decisions and real risk to patients in clinical trials.

","Have to write for this one, but some of the people here are quite fake. One moment you’re a great analyst, the next day you are getting yelled at. A few folks in upper management (director or higher), lose their cool fast/unexpectedly. Yet, they have weak guidance and direction. Making it tough to seek advice or proper feedback. I do see a great growth trajectory, but I can see one too many getting stuck unless they dedicate their life to the company (50+ hour weeks). The biggest con is definitely the poor guidance/direction of what management wants you to do. Often, the resources aren’t there and people just want to stick to their day to day cause that’s already heaping amount work for them. Room to make improvements lacking because managements ear is focused on what is going on and less than what the crystal ball shows for the future.
Advice to Management
Look to the future and provide the resources. Historical data is extremely useful and employees need to be highly encouraged to use it. Directors or higher should be aware that this the future and the companies that utilize these tech routes often are leaner. Great way to reduce HC spend on roles that a dashboard can just handle.

Too many resources are dedicated to the image of the CEO, who is overly concerned about his own personal image. Whatever he wants, he gets, regardless of budgets. Credo indoctrination leads to a ""we can do no wrong,"" holier than thou attitude toward competitors, regulators, and critics.
Advice to Management
Push the employees further up and the stock-holders further down in terms of groups to keep happy. Think about what makes/made the company a special place to work and protect that. Get serious about diversity in the upper ranks. Dial back on the PR resources dedicated to making the CEO look like a super-hero. It's gotten nauseating.

","If you want to understand the real J&J imagine working in North Korea. While the narrative is well orchestrated for public consumption, the reality is at best a land of grey inefficiency, at worst something far darker 

Mediocrity rules the day. 
The real key to a long and successful career it to never make waves. 
Do not stand out for good or bad 
Do your work but do not shine in any way. 

Drinking the credo kool aid is especially important. The credo is a brilliant PR stunt while in reality it is moral relativism. Tell the Tylenol story over and over since that was the last time the company placed doing the right thing over profits.

Agism and reverse discrimination are the order of the day. White males over 40 are an endangered species at J&J. Applaud loudly when you are forced to sit through lectures such as, ""avoid the merit trap when hiring or promoting"". Science and facts are not permitted when it comes to the irrefutable diversity narrative. 

If you are a lemming, J&J will serve you well especially if your skin color, sexual preference, etc plays into the diversity quotas. If you are happy being a nameless cog in the machine you will do well. If you are the type who blindly follow your ""dear leader"" you will do even better. If you care about making a difference and have personal integrity, look elsewhere.

Tue Sep 18 2018, R&D,"Fort Washington, PA",Current Employee ,Fort Washington was better...,5,"This is a great networking experience and very well respected company. The benefits are great and the (various sites) have a lot of nice perks e.g. work from home, on-site gym facilities, nice cafeterias, some have sports fields, and open seating. You'll work with the most respected and recognizable brands in the industry from OTC to Medical Devices to Rx, this company has something for all backgrounds.
","There is a high level of stress due to the increased work loads. Staff can easily pull in 60 hour work weeks with quick deadlines on projects. Sites are severly understaffed due to budgets. That seems to be a big issue - budgets are low and have been cut. We hear it at almost every town hall - budgets. 

With that comes layoffs and not backfilling positions. There are numerous rumors (use that word loosely as it can be meaningless) of more layoffs, sites closing, outsourcing and relocations. The promotional process is very tough. If you have an avanced degree above a Bachelor's you're protected and can advance easily. If you only have a Bachelor's degree, you'll go years without anything. There is considerable bias towards who gets promoted by upper management, folks can easily feel unwanted. Also, recent graduates with advanced degrees will often come in at higher positions rather than somebody with more years of experience and a lesser degree. Overall, it's stressful. You're expected to turn around 9 projects in three days and don't you dare be late because if you are, it goes up the chain and you'll hear about it. Project management is terrible. Instead of staggering projects, they'll clump everything together and overload the same staff members. Very healthy.

It comes with certain sense of pride as you work for a financially strong company that has a part in contributing to the health and wellness of people all over the world. Attracts many smart and talented people. Many people build their careers off this company and stay with it for decades, but no matter your seniority, you are expected to perform, and even shift job functions every few years, so there is a surprisingly low amount of ""dead weight"" for a company with so many veterans. Focus on credo values and focus on efficiency.
","In finance, how busy you are is heavily dependent on the financial calendar. Because of efficiency, sometimes there aren't sufficient backups to certain functions and it is tough to take vacation sometimes if you don't plan them far enough ahead. Because of the global nature of the company, you can sometimes work very early or late hours to maximize times interacting with teams in other time zones. Sometimes meetings can consume a good part of your day, leaving you less time to actually get work done.

I worked at Johnson & Johnson full-time for more than a year
Pros
Great, affordable benefits. The company rode proudly on its name (branding). 
I could see it as being a good fit if you had a position that you saught and there appeared to be avenues for other positions within, but that onus is on you to seek out.
Cons
Comming from an acquired company, there was little to no support about company sponsored benefits/programs or directions from management. We were told to continue doing what we had been doing prior to on-boarding, then you are called down for not making quota while you were working in a team structure and had no account(s) assigned specifically to you.
You are very much put into a box and expected to move in lock-step without knowing the cadence. No collaboration, every man for themselves.
If you wanted out of the box they put you in, it is up to you to apply for, be selected, and interview for as if you were a complete outsider to the company. No ability to transfer or transition seamlessly.
