","Where should I start? Many employees have told me their one-word to describe Gilead. The most frequent one is ""soul-crushing"" which is technically two words I guess. ""Abyss"" is another common one. I personally refer to Gilead as ""Gulag"" because it better resembles what the actual company is. Gilead is just a hyped up patent trolling company that has 0 original research in their portfolio. Other companies in the market cap size of Gilead spend hundreds of millions on finding new proteins and targets to go after. What does Gilead do? Gilead exclusively focuses on finding established patents on hot targets from other companies, then puts a bunch of chemists and tells them to find one differentiation point that can allow them to patent a compound. The die-hard med chemists then proceed to make 3000 compounds as if their whole lives are on the line (their mindset is very similar to the Chinese patent trolling companies), tweaking every single thing until they get some point of differentiation between the competition and their structure. This is a common tactic in pharma, but Gilead is arguably the only company with its market cap size that exclusively (more than 95% of the time) relies on this method. 
Now, management is just full of die-hard people who want to advance their own career, and in this scenario, only numbers matter. Not quality of work. Just numbers. How many compounds did you make? How many assays did you run? That kind of thing. 
 Every form of management (from the managers who just have one supervised individual) to those high up are just thinking about themselves and not about how to support their supervised individuals. I bet if they did then the efficiency of the company would actually rise above its current levels. But hey why actually make your employees want to come to work? They should always be miserable working their jobs right?
If you're looking for a job anywhere, just don't come to Gilead in their research departments. You'll probably develop alcoholism like 90% of the employees in the research departments. Don't even worry about your mental health. By joining Gilead, you would be basically pawning off your liver.
Advice to Management
Maybe for once look into how the managers are actually managing their employees instead of just patting yourself on the back for a drug that doesn't even work for covid. Maybe instead of buying back your stock constantly to improve your executive bonuses you can give salaries that are actually competitive with the other companies in the area. Maybe consider that many of your employees live in a very expensive area yet cannot afford basic housing? I guess you're not thinking about them from your mansions in Pacific Heights while you're working from home and telling the researchers to come in every week in the midst of a pandemic that can kill them and their families. But hey your end of the year bonus is more important right? You gotta get that brand new Ferrari instead of the 2018 model that you currently drive. Must be such a tough life for you.

Sat Jan 09 2021, Manufacturing Specialist,"Morris Plains, NJ",Former Employee ,"Comprehensive review - Former Immunomedics Employee, Part of the Acquisition in Oct 2020",0,"Medical, dental, 401k are above industry standards. Pay was average. I used to work in the manufacturing at Immunomedics, acquired by Gilead in Oct 2020. I worked there for about three years. I worked with some really amiable and talented people before they left for other opportunities. When I first started in 2017, the department was awesome. The people were awesome, the management was awesome, and the culture was awesome. By the end of 2020, everything had changed; it was a gradual descent over the years into a cesspool of toxicity, backstabbing, and maniacal narcissism.
","Things changed when the management changed. The middle level management team I started with in 2017 was completely replaced by mid 2020. Mid level management left because upper level management was extremely disconnected from reality. Upper level management goals were absurd; clearly, some of them failed remedial algebra. If upper management left their offices and walked around the building, they would see the limitations of the facility, equipment, and staffing.

The department was incredibly understaffed when I worked there. Ironically, after the acquisition, the department is now even more understaffed. Several people quit in early 2020 and plans were made to replace them but never executed upon. More people left after the acquisition. I heard only one person will be hired to replace the four people who left. 1 = 4? The new management in the department seeks to squeeze as much juice out of the remaining employees as possible. Understaffed, overworked, and unappreciated.

The culture of the department is no longer what it used to be. Now, the culture is really toxic; it is an atmosphere supported by horrible mid level management. The wrong people became supervisors and managers. Any good managers have been pushed out and isolated and will remain isolated until they quit. Perception is king here now.

Also, the new management only rewards the employees they favor. Whether those employees actually do any work is optional. The management holds yearly bonuses and promotions as hostage. If you want a bonus or promotion, you have to curry favor. To curry favor, you have to stab your co-workers in the back. If anyone makes a mistake, the first one to point a finger gets rewarded.

New management exacerbates problems instead of fixing them. They readily blame lower level employees, scapegoating them for issues beyond their control. The worst part is the toxic environment changed the personalities of some of the co-workers I worked with.

In retrospect, I joined the company for the people, the culture, and the opportunity to grow as an employee. I left because now there is none of that. Gilead in Morris Plains or the former Immunomedics site has become one of the worst places I have ever worked, when it used to be one of the best.
Advice to Management
For Current Middle level management - You should quit trying to manage people because you clearly have zero management skills. Perhaps practice managing a rock before managing people. You need not to worry though, soon you will be managing nobody since everyone will have quit for better opportunities.

For Current Upper level management - You should step out of your offices and visit the various departments and laboratories. It would help you get an understanding of reality.

I worked in the commercial org of Gilead Sciences from 2017-19. I came in below market rate and worked on a HIV revenue model forecasting between $12-13B annually. I regularly worked weekends too and the pressure was intense to be perfect with the numbers. Over time, access to key meetings with business partners were cut off as well as internal meetings. During team meetings, the tall white males talked by far the most. More work was placed upon me, while still getting paid way below market rate. Then my hiring manager was let go. Other business partners were let go. All were minorities, mostly Asian Americans. 

I also heard that HR already investigated the clear bias for tall white males in leadership roles. There was a session with a management consulting firm to address grievances. No actions were taken. I was let go in 2019 with 1.5 days of severance. I also spent 8 years with a Fortune 100 company before my time at Gilead, and also have a top-tier MBA. 

Do not join Gilead if you don't fit the part of a tall white male with a certain level of assertiveness.

Pros
Occasionally serve good Indian food
Cons
The culture is toxic, and favoritism is rampant. There is deep segregation between permanent employees and contractors. You know you are ranked, especially during events where contractors must pay for their food. Contractors are either given mundane low-level tasks or extremely complicated assignments not aligned to their skill set, a sure setup for failure, and an arrogant HR department, whose employees are out of touch to enforce real working policies. Lots of backstabbers hired and promoted by their management friend. The company lost extremely talented employees and bright, hard-working contractors who left without a chance to be part of the organization.

Contractors to be assigned and SEGREGATED to separate work stations/benches, while full time employees are given private cubicles. The workstation/benches are located in the busiest hallways within the building, where everyone and anyone who walks by your workstation/bench is able to have full visibility of what you are viewing on your computer screen. In addition, I’ve had multiple
instances of harassment from full time employees while sitting in these workstations/benches. However, this new policy not only violates the inclusion and diversity principal that is so
highly publicized, but also has potential legal implications.

From this new transition to the workstation/benches, I have contracted health issues and mental health problems in which it now affects the
way I live my everyday life and also affects my work performance.

This policy of segregation for contractors is almost identically representative of America’s former Racial Segregation law that MLK had sacrificed his life for.

Then you have family working in the same department, maybe not with the same ""manager"" but under the same department umbrella. From what I understand, Gilead just revamped their compliance department. HR may want to take a look at this as it does upset the work environment, which puts a damper on the department.

Wed Sep 11 2019,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Tolerable most days,18,"Paid Relo...if you are willing to move to a higher cost of living location, pay higher local and state taxes, take a pay cut, AND title cut

It’s a steady job with a paycheck—Gilead as a company that isn’t going away any time soon. Based on all the other Glassdoor reviews...you pretty much know what you are getting yourself into. 

More “perks” compared to legacy pharma companies such as free snacks, free gym access, free bagel day, etc. 

Commitment to science-first philosophy...in comparison to many of the local biotech startup companies that are more focused on doing whatever it takes to secure the next round of capital 

The employee turnover is so high here that Gilead has enabled me to expand my network among many ex-gilead employees who at other biotech companies...good for me...I think?
","No development. This is not a company for recent college grad students. It’s sink or swim...even for experienced hires. 

The types of behaviors that are rewarded at Gilead are not rewarded elsewhere. You can tell the difference pretty quickly between the “legacy Gilead” people vs people who have legitimate work experience and come to Gilead. It’s a rude awakening. 

Lots of gaslighting...management will break your spirit pretty quickly here...and because teams are so lean, you end up doing lots of work with very little reward or recognition.

Rampant nepotism. The culture is not meritocracy-based....it’s all about relationships. Forget it if you have aspirations of advancement and do not fit the “Gilead mold.” (Make, white-ish, good looking, BFFs with leadership)

The longer you stay at Gilead, the more ruthless you become. I suppose there is a ruthlessness at all big companies...Gilead culture holds a very special place. 

Contractors are literally second class employees...with very little/no opportunity for full time hire. I’ve seen so many people try to get their “foot in the door” by coming through the contractor route and they work really hard...for years. There is part of me that wishes I could tell them they are better off trying to get their foot in the door elsewhere. 

Three words...”The Gilead way.” That’s all I am going to say about that.

","If you are interested in working in Talent Acquisition, be very careful. They have no data management or OFCCP compliance strategy, at all. The company went from a few thousand employees to 11 thousand in the span of a few short years - consequently most of the executives are people who have grown up with the company, and haven't been exposed to minor market global HR strategies - particularly in Talent Acquisition. The department uses several layers of contractors as recruiters and sourcers, and many of them have been on contract longer than the limit required of a federal contractor. Everywhere you turn, there is another horrible Easter egg waiting to be discovered in the form of non-compliance. I would also note that their current leader of TA, Stanley Blackwell, is a terrible leader - he is not engaged and he isolated key members of his staff from the business. He is also extremely rude.

Tue Mar 05 2019, Senior Director,,Former Employee ,"Incredible learning, but at times it was tough being a woman of color there",12,"Beautiful campus with ample parking, wonderful perks and facilities, lovely offices, nice cafes. In my years there I saw an evolution in many positive ways, with increasing employee perks like commuter benefits and cafe improvements. The pace is incredible and the learning opportunities abound. I felt secure in my job and had the chance to learn across multiple diseases. I met some wonderfully dedicated people and some genius scientists too! Bottom line, learned a ton and met many friends for life. Thanks Gilead and bravo for the courage to tackle terrible diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C.
","My experience being a minority woman at times was very hard and discouraging. Diversity/inclusion issues was ultimately a main driver for my leaving as there is a old club mentality and tribalism that felt very hard to break through after a certain level. There are a lot of public efforts in D&I across the company, but it's all a work in progress. Over time I felt my career options would be limited or delayed since I am a woman of color. I truly hope the new CEO tackles this key issue which may be driving (some) people away and limiting the power of its existing talent. Of course different groups may not have had the same D&I challenges; this was just my personal experience among many great ones.

Tue Jan 08 2019,Anonymous,"Foster City, CA",Former Employee ,"Director, Med Affairs",35,"There are some brilliant people in Gilead. I cannot name names, but those familiar with clinical research and med affairs will know whom I am talking about. These are some of the trailblazers and world thought leaders in HIV - and they are actually extremely humble, collaborative, and kind people (in addition to being flat-out brilliant). 

If you come to Gilead, you will get the chance to work with great people and touch cutting-edge research.

Also, the pay is comparatively better in my experience than the industry. Stock bonuses reach down to levels that are lower than in many other pharma industry peers, and the actual base (and bonus) compensation is considerable.
","Management can be unhelpful - and at times actually harmful and unprofessional. If you get the wrong boss, you will be micromanaged, no matter what level you are at. And this goes all the way down to senior vice presidents arguing with you about font and colour choices in PowerPoint slides. 

This is not a joke or an exaggeration.

Managers - especially those who have been in the company for a while - lead by fear, humiliation, and bullying. And in some cases, they ""lead"" by humblebragging - in the middle of presentations being led by their subordinates.

I have been working for 25 years, and my boss (and I mean BOSS, not manager or leader) was the worst I have ever had, including when I was a minimum wage worker selling cheap suits in college.

Gilead prides itself on being 'flexible' - work gets done quickly and without bureaucracy because there are few SOPs or explicit rules to follow, which can be good. On the other hand, this means that channels to get approval or feedback rely almost completely on precedence. So, if you're a newcomer (read: someone who has less than 5 years in), you will either simply have to guess the ""right"" way (which is ""The Gilead Way"") to get something done, or you will be at the mercy of the goodwill of someone who does. 

Finally, the internal culture is very Manichean - the ""long timers"" (who have 10+ years in) and everyone else. The former - leaders will say hi to you, will call you out in meetings, and in some cases invite you to ""in group"" events at their homes. The latter - leaders will walk by you in the hall way and not even smile at you.
Advice to Management
You have hired some brilliant people - STOP MICROMANAGING THEM. Way too much time is spent ""fine tuning"" PowerPoint slides, which is frankly a waste of time. Recognize that it's not 1987, and not every great idea is going to come from someone who appeared in the photo in a short-sleeve shirt and tie standing in front of the low-rise building that was the initial HQ.

Show your employees that you actually value them, and they will stop answer calls from head hunters.

The primary fault of the previous CEO was his tolerance for the despotic behavior of certain members of senior management, and its negative impact on company culture, retention, and performance. The Board’s decision to replace the CEO was a necessary step that is likely to have immediate impact by requiring the bad actors of senior management to shape up or get left behind, as the new CEO seems to have an ethical and moral framework that won’t tolerate the despotic culture that certain members of senior management have used to hold back and discourage entire portions of their own sections of the of the organization
","Certain members of senior management have tyrannically enforced a culture whereby the company’s positive value of following the science is warped to the despotic behavior of excluding those not in a scientist role whenever and wherever possible, by promoting their friends into roles that they are unqualified for, micromanaging project execution, and the ruthless holding back those deserving of promotions in apparent spite. These member of senior management have a plethora of HR complaints against them yet refuse to change their behavior in a meaningful way, apparently because they actually believe they are doing nothing wrong and are very happy with the despot that they’ve created for themselves.

Promotion not based on achieving criteria or doing a good job, but on business need. If there is no business need, no amount of hard work will help. Best to take it easy and wait until next year.
“Inclusion” is a cultural belief, but Management fails to make themselves equally accessible to all direct reports. They socialize with the same people over and over, providing the optics that they are not approachable (and have favorites).

","Unfortunately there are a lot of cons. The legacy VPs have been in their role too long and are not collaborating with newer employees mainly because of insecurity on their part. There have been a few leadership changes but a major reorganization is way overdue. Poor behavior is awarded it’s funny how the me too movement doesn’t cover women who bully other women in the workplace just to get to the top. Beware there are several female leaders that need coaching on how to work with other women. As for diversity Gilead is really behind the times very very few leaders in the organization that represents the world we actually live in. Unfortunately or fortunately I have a lazy boss that delegates everything so I get great experience but the down fall is work life balance is way off and my boss really hasn’t managed a team before so therefore they are even too lazy to promote or expand the group.

","Gilead strives to get the most out of its employees, and not by way of professional development. While it prides itself on ""being lean by design"" it boils down to being a sweat shop geared for burn out in approximately 2-3 years, which is about the average length of stay for most employees. While the compensation may be enticing, in the long run it is not worth it.

Good 401k match (10k). Good benefits in general & 3 weeks vacation, but I’m not sure they’re any better than those at any other big company. One paid day of community service per year. Good community service opportunities. Very good soup/salad bars. Some very smart and kind co-workers and at least one good manager (but I think that’s true at most companies). Beautiful location and nice gym.

I had one great manager. Too bad they reorged (for no good reason) and just introduced chaos and turnover into a system that was working fine before the reorg.
","No salary or perk can compensate for a manager that treats you like you’re a expendable piece of crap. And HR doesn’t have an effective policy in place to handle managers that go haywire (outside of blaming the employee, creating the retention issue that Gilead is becoming/is already famous for). 
Too many remote managers, which doesn’t help bridge possible communication gaps. Can't they at least require teleconferences or require remote managers to travel to the Foster City site (or are they too precious for that?)? 
No clear progression of ""disciplinary actions"" so a manager can fire or manage you out on a whim (like his/her marriage is on the rocks or he/she's on a power trip). I find that when managers feel they can get away with anything (especially bc they somehow managed to stay at Gilead 5+ years), smug, arrogant, and complacent behavior can develop.

PLEASE ONLY HIRE MANAGERS WHO RATE HIGH ON EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

Don't assume that a good scientist/statistician is a good manager. If they have terrible communication skills and fear/hate people, they can't compensate for that by having 3 PhDs or whatever else.

Don't allow management to dump criticism/ambush employees in a year-end performance review when REASONABLE demands haven't been clearly voiced and documented before. There shouldn't really be any surprises at those year-end reviews. Those ""surprises"" are the ultimate in passive-aggression and are the hallmarks of an insecure and vastly underqualified manager/HR department (with perhaps also demonstrate a sadistic streak).

Sadly there's an ""old guard"" that have been with the commercial groups for years that create a good ol' boy network -- you're either one of them, or not. Most movement happens if you move to Foster City and take a hit on cost of living, but there are no guarantees.

","Many people here have written about Gilead running lean and the long hours you will work. And while that may be true for some, it is not much different than any other biotech. We work hard no matter where we go.

The issue with Gilead is that the people there are awful. They will backstab you, try and sabotage your project, falsify data, walk all over you and NO ONE CARES. It is the norm. 

I was never yelled at by anyone I worked with until I went to Gilead. Despite the fact that I worked very hard, and was very successful in my experiments, when I was attacked by a colleague, no one did anything. In fact, I was told I needed to do a better job at not getting so upset. That's when I decided to leave. How can you possibly tell someone they need to get better at taking abuse?

When I left and shared all of this with HR, the woman acted so appalled. But you know what? There still was nothing done to end the behavior. The person who was abusing me (and many others) has never been disciplined.

I can tell you, quite honestly, this is the worst place I have ever worked for. They pay less than everyone else, they don't care about you or your happiness, there are all kinds of weird inappropriate relationships going on that determine the success of the projects, and it often times feels more like a pick up scene than a workplace. People are so unhappy. They have been treated so badly and there is no recourse for them. There is no one there to help them. I honestly did not meet one single person who said they were happy working for Gilead.

Also, the people may be smart, but they are far behind on technologies and many of them are missing key skills to get new jobs. It's a sad place and I advise that, if you can, go anywhere else but here. Until they start showing they actually care about their people and their culture, this place is going to continue to sink.
Advice to Management
Get it together. You cannot continue to allow people to be treated horribly by their coworkers and their supervisors. It is a disgrace that your HR would allow this to go on for so long. Soon enough, people are going to catch on to who you are and you will not be able to recruit any good talent.
I suggest a proactive action from HR where the people who are repeat offenders and abusers are eliminated to set an example for the others. Put someone in HR in each building to watch over things and be there for the employees. That way, these things can be caught quickly.

Compared to start up, great place to make mistakes (or to practice things by trial and error) and learn from them. Being a fast learner is appreciated here and how one excels. Being able to navigate through the mean girls and narcissists and talkers is a good skill to learn too, and how one excels.

Why are senior leadership bogged down with this responsibility when the day to day experiences with software are had by the worker bees? 

Old version of Google chrome is used because they can't figure out how to get their regulated software to work (suuure).

Culture is bipolar, risk takers on submissions and bulldogs to health authorities - and big proponents of going fast in general - but conservative in internal treatment of staff and handling difficult situations; and promotions (read other's reviews here). Can lead to passive aggressive attacks when forced to work with people even though you dislike one another simply b/c managers don't want to rock the boat or cause drama. Address the issues within group or team head on in a timely manner. Rip off the band-aid! Low quotas for promotion each year. Small raises each year even as a rockstar. Segue to...

So much drama (read: politics) which isn't a huge surprise given hierarchical culture. Too much deference given to and power willingly given up by lower levels to senior middle management for their agreement, or buy in. Can't people make a decision themselves these days? Take a stand, have an opinion and justify it but be willing to be wrong or rejected. 

Too much separation between senior leadership and everyone else. The problems they want to address are very different from the ones I'd like to address. 

Also lack of knowledge about what everyone's role is.

","Don't think about upward or lateral promotions unless you are in a group where turnover is high and then you're promoted for even average performance every year. Management does not regard employees as assets, unless you are in the favorite list. A lot of mid level managers who have no idea what they are doing - have no autonomy and no authority. HR is a mess and of no help to employees.
Advice to Management
Improve the culture and development opportunities - put employee development on your priority list and that does not mean having a place to write ""career plans"" on performance review. If an employee is not considered good enough to promote even after 3 years, then consider shedding them - but if they are, then promote them DON'T ruin their career track by doing nothing.

If not, you’ll be stuck doing a 7 to 7 job every day without any recognitions or promotions. I started as a contractor, then later became a full time employee. Had multiple re-org within the past three years, and new directions depending on upper management.
In my opinion, Gilead grew too fast trying to hire new talents while trying to backfill burned out talents. It’s a never ending cycle, where majority of the talents working for Gilead only had been with company for 1 to 3 years. 
This is one company I wouldn’t recommend unless you enjoy 7 to 7 work schedule with no appreciation. The old timers “with at least 7 years” are stubborn and unwilling to learn and adopt to new things. It a tough job, if you are hungry, take the job so you don’t starve. Then you should immediately start looking, don’t get comfortable. This is a hit and run situation.

Good work life balance - a lot of negative reviews of people not having work-life balance, however, the parking lots are empty by before 8 am and after 5:30 pm 

There definitely are a lot of opportunities to grow or transition to different functions, but you need to have the right connections to be on the inside track.
","May not apply to all departments but widely prevalent - 

Empire Building, lots of it - departments are very territorial and are trying to grab power. All the finger pointing, back stabbing and complaining makes it difficult to get things done.

As previously mentioned, growth opportunities a limited to those who have learned to navigate the waters, its not really a 'pay for performance' system. 

Very reactive and lots of busy work, probably the reason for low work life balance.
People aren't as smart (or hard working) as they claim - R&D maybe top notch, but most other functions are about average.

Thu Dec 22 2016,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Good Short Term Job -- Getting Experience,34,"They get to the point at Gilead and avoid the fluff. It is a place run by scientists. Imagine everyone working like they are a post-doc.

Large company with established HR and supporting administration roles. The reimbursement for professional education (certificates/master's degree) is good. The matching retirement with immediate retirement vest is nice. The employee stock purchase plan is now basically worthless, only a 6 month look back when it used to be a 2 year look back.

Like everyone says, you will learn a lot if you want to at Gilead. You can be given extremely critical tasks with thin staffing. Everyone needs to work hard and long hours. You meet a lot of people with much industry experience and it definitely helps build your network.
","The starting pay is below other major companies. The chance for advancement with the company is slim. At Gilead, doing high quality work and meeting goals does NOT mean you will advance. You will know within 2 years if you have a chance at advancement. They only pick a few people to advance up the ranks and these few are the ones they want to develop and promote within the company. If you get no promotion within 2 years. It means it is time to move on.

It is extremely difficult to get management approvals since most everything needs to be approved by your dept. VP. The middle managers have very little control over any decisions or any of the budget. Also, the managers are working managers yet they are in meetings 6-8 hours a day. That means it is hard to make progress since the people actually doing work are always in meetings and near unavailable. 

Gilead employees have a lot of fear. If they make a mistake and own it, then that will kill their career since mistakes are unacceptable. This makes accountability a core value unpromoted within the company. A culture of owning a mistake and making it right is critical to having character and trust within an organization. Otherwise, blame is just passed since staff are in fear for their jobs.

Since pay is below prevailing wages it is difficult to recruit and retain talented people. It puts an enormous burden on the few employees pulling the brunt of the weight.

It is common to be working all nighters until 5 AM, sleeping a couple of hours and then working a full work day starting at 9 AM the same day.
Advice to Management
Re-envision the way the company operates. With the stock price in free fall and the company at its peak, you can no longer expect employees to stay for the big stock windfall. Gilead is no longer like a startup company with giant upside on stock. It is a mature company that needs stability in it's work force by paying fair base industry salaries to recruit great employees.

We gain a valuable breadth of experience which may not be possible at other, more siloed companies. We work with industry leading products.
","The Gilead experience varies by group. But the overarching theme is dissatisfaction. The company struggles to retain talent as many employees leave within a few years. They struggle to attract talent given their reputation as a workplace and below-market compensation. Career advancement is very slow, and lateral moves are not always supported (varies by team). Your colleagues will openly talk about leaving the company.
Advice to Management
Retaining your employees will take a huge effort to address many systemic issues at Gilead. It will take addressing compensation (Gilead can't afford not to pay best in class salaries to current and incoming talent), career development, encouraging vertical/ horizontal/ diagonal career moves within groups, training your people managers, investing in headcount to balance workload and drive greater depth/ sophistication, among many other changes. Until management prioritizes these changes, people will keep leaving Gilead - and the company will keep losing institutional history and have to start over again and again.

Hire enough staff to handle the workload so you aren't burning out good employees. Give them at least a cost of living increase each year.

Without touting Gilead's good work, the only impression people have are from Sovaldi pricing controversies and from burnt-out folks on Glassdoor and otherwise. There's a lot of value to be had in improving the external image, especially in regards to recruiting

When I interviewed, I heard a lot about how much you learn in a short time and how those skills can be of benefit further in your career. It seemed to be a foregone conclusion that people only stay for a couple of years and, from what I've seen the organization has a high tolerance for short tenures and rapid turn-over. I appreciate this from a business continuity point-of-view, but it doesn't exactly make people feel valued if you make them seem easily replaceable. I'd suggest emphasizing a message that this is a place you can stay for a long time and have a broad and fulfilling career.

Thu Aug 25 2016,N/A,"Oceanside, CA"," in Oceanside, CA",Poor management.... leadership does not exist,21,"Pay is great compared to most other private sector jobs but lacking compared to other biotechs in the county. Most rank and file employees are excellent. Benefits are good in terms of options, but pricey if you have a family. Location in north county is convenient but that area has crime problems. Corporate has great development programs for employees.
","1) Even though Gilead Corporate has management tools available it seems as if little to none of the managers have taken a class in management or even understand the fundamentals.

2)Leadership does not exist. Every time without fail when an employee starts to show leadership potential they force them out (GP, CW, YX, SD(G), YG, JW, CM, GM, SH) and many many more! There is definitely a feeling that those in the ""manager"" band feel threatened by their employees attempts to move up, take more responsibility, and blaze their own trail. Often the employees MUST create their own path because there is no direction given to the employees or if there is direction it changes daily (not exaggerating).

3) The lack of leadership and management is supported by the worst HR department I have ever worked with. HR is very anti-employee and unprofessional and seems to take delight in stomping on the little girl, or guy for that matter.

4)Worst internal promotion system I have ever seen. Gilead Oceanside does not promote from within. It takes 2-3 years of having exceeded ratings and approval by all the other managers to get promoted (unless you are HR of course). It is a popularity contest. For corporate Gilead one could get promoted at mid-year or at the end of the year. For Gilead Oceanside you can only get promoted at year end because ""we don't promote at mid-year here"" ....WHAT?....Very few exceptions are made for this unwritten rule. That's right, if you ask for the written policy it will never be provided. Another example: Pretend you have someone above you in your department leave or an opening is created that is only 1 level above you. One might think that you could apply and have a reasonable chance of getting the position because you have been with the company for 5 years, you are already doing the job, and you have exceeded or better performance reviews. NO...No no no. You will never get the job because ""it is something we just don't do"". Gilead would much rather hire externally and in many cases place someone with ZERO experience in that position and expect you to train them. Do not go to this location and expect to climb the ladder...that is unless you are part of the old guard from Genentech.

5) The QA department over regulates instead of regulating smartly causing deviation after deviation after deviation. A large portion is also very cliquey and if you are not from PR....

6) They do not take the Security of the employees or the facility seriously. There have been multiple instances of drunken vagrants on the property, thefts, vandalism, people using drugs, and even an attempted assault on a scientist where a trespasser pick up a chair and tried to smash a window to get to the scientist. The Gilead Manager in charge of Security keeps changing but the policies do not. They refuse to restrict access to the facility by means of a fence (every other company in the area has one for a reason), every time the security team starts to make progress the head security officer gets fired from the company (the last one when he was on vacation). Gilead Oceanside will continue to wait until something serious happens and then react, like always.

7) Frankly I am getting tired of writing the cons as they could continue for quite a bit. If you are the type to put your head down, love micromanagement, keep mouth shut, and collect a paycheck this is the place for you. If you ask why, attempt any continuous improvement initiatives or show any sort of leadership and ambition...run away. Just run away.
Advice to Management
Key management positions should be reevaluated. Promote from within. Get someone with real HR experience who understands that it is the employees who make the company, not the walls and equipment. Promote at mid-year. Make management training required (beyond the initial rudimentary training) and hold them accountable. So much experience, passion, and desire has been lost due to poor management and lack of empathy with employees. If one were to equate those intangibles to dollar figure it would be astounding.

The pay is quite good.
People are friendly, smart, professional.
Learning & Development training classes
Money for perqs (company lunches, off-sites, launch swag, parties)
","The pace. Everything is an emergency due yesterday. 
Perfection is expected along with working at incredibly fast pace. Resulting mistakes are not forgotten or forgiven.
The stress level is enormous. The working hours are like most jobs in silicon valley, but this is not a fun place to work. People don't build relationships or communities because they need to get their work done so they can get home for dinner, see their kids for an hour, then do more work. The work itself is not fun but a never ending slog.
There is a lack of infrastructure so everything is on excel spreadsheets which can easily have mistakes that are not easy to spot. And those mistakes are not forgiven.
Analysis paralysis is rampant. Data crunching adding 80% work on a project that may only provide 5% gain is an everyday occurrence. Doing things the most labor intensive way versus looking for best practices and efficiencies.
""Reasonably lean"" means everyone is working 2-3 jobs. The company is running short staffed and relies on temps and contractors when full-time employees are needed.
Not a 'great place to work' atmosphere. It's a company run by MDs. MDs are not known for being warm and fuzzy. Every day felt like an unrewarding sweatshop in a gorgeous office with impossible deadlines.
Work is spread out so that anyone can be working at any job. So a new college grad could have an opportunity to run a project that usually happens to a more senior staff, but a more senior staff could be running spreadsheets that a new college grad would be doing at most companies. Great for someone moving up in their career but waste of time and money to pay senior staff to do analyst work.

If you don't fawn over your upper manager (AD & above), you get no where and you can't get promotions for the team you manage. I also found upper management to be ""pouty"" and treat their subordinates poorly if you ever disappointed them. Often times upper management asks for something, you give them what they asked for, but it wasn't what they really wanted, and then they would chastise you. Another example of upper management not taking responsibility for their mistake and playing what I call the ""blame game."" Other cons include no tele-commute policy, lied to by upper management instead of treating subordinates as adults, favoritism, and disrespect. Definitely no work/life balance.

Most people is very nice and willing to help but when they help you, you know that there is so much work to be done that you will responsible for lengthening their work day, too. Gilead has a noble mission and high ideals including their commitment to always keep the patient perspective in mind when developing and re-formulating drugs simply to increase their safety in the human body.
","Everything is an 'emergency' all the time as their is chronic understaffing especially in pharmacovigilance. Too many company 'group' emails, most of which do not pertain to one's function, but must be triaged anyway, in case...time waster.
Noble mission, but below director level they treat their employees quite poorly, managers manage poorly, and they hope you will stay due to their 'golden handcuffs' despite continuing to make no effort to improve the situation. As the company has grown (too fast, and poorly- they should get their money back from whichever consultant told them to do it this way), those handcuffs have become much less shiny. 
Gilead prohibits or frowns upon working from home, even for areas for which it would make no difference. They have old software and the recent upgrade was already 4 years behind when they put it in place.
While turnover is typical of the industry, Gilead has excessive turnover below the Director level. People just choose not to take it anymore, even if it means losing money to go somewhere else. That is a testament to the working conditions at this time.
Gilead is a 'lean' company, and proud of it. The problem is that it is now too lean and experienced employees are looking elsewhere. They claim to want to be more diverse and welcome new ideas but they actually begin a targeted brainwashing process that basically says there is a wrong way, a right way and the Gilead way. They are so sure that the Gilead way is correct that they are not at all truly interested in change. Gilead is not really interested in what their employees have to say, despite the fact that they give a lot of lip service saying that they do, set up 'task forces' and committees, have big presentations about the results, and then really DO nothing different. Gilead: We have a problem...
Advice to Management
One measure of bad management is people leaving a department or company due to managers who are unwilling or unable to adjust their style to get the best out of their employees. If Gilead is authentically interested in retaining skilled employees, you need to take a closer look at this situation. Is it really worth it?
Improve mentoring and training and don't just leave smart people to 'wing it' and then be upset with what they do and how they perform.

Increase your subsidy for food. People should be able to get at least 10.00 worth of food free of charge, and you pay for anything over that amount out of pocket.
Have hot, healthy food available all day, not just at specific hours. And consider more healthy and much more diverse food/drink selections.

If you think money alone is going to keep people at Gilead, consider paying a lot more than you do now. Take a hard look at the actual hours your employees require to get the workload finished...and remember it is never finished, it keeps coming at a phrenetic pace. THEN, consider your pay scale.

It's near the Bay Trail if you like to take walks.
They have mediocre bagels on Wednesdays.
","So you want to work for Gilead?

Let me tell you my experience:

This is the absolute worst company I have ever worked for. I feel sick every day and I can't sleep. I know many other people with stress and sleep problems because they are miserable.

I am a scientist and 'research' here is a pathetic group of backstabbing know-nothings. Middle management doesn't have the experience necessary to perform quality research. Post-docs (with no industry experience) are hired to mange associates with 20+ years industry experience then direct these miserable associates to repeat and repeat and repeat the most idiotic of tasks. Research suffers because middle management will not hire experienced people. It's my opinion that management will not hire experienced people because they don't want to be questioned or challenged by people who actually know what they are doing!

It should also come as no surprise that all of Gilead's HIV and HCV drugs were purchased from other companies or were 'fast follow-ons' based on other companies patents. There isn't a creative bone to be found any where in research. Research is a farce. Management will make you repeat assays if they don't like the results and, if management still doesn't like your results, it's your fault!

Oh so you want a promotion? If you do not sacrifice your family, life, and sanity to Gilead, forget ever being promoted. There is ZERO work-life balance. No matter how hard you work, you will not be rewarded unless your boss is skilled at managing Gilead's politics! Managers have to fight with each other to get associates promoted and, if your boss isn't in the 'in crowd', you will never get promoted or even recognized for the work you do. Also, yearly ratings are based on a bell curve which means someone must always be at the bottom of the curve. It's not hard to pick out which poor sod will be the next to get axed based on 'who is the director's pet'. And then management is applauded for 'getting rid of the dead weight'. To me, as a manager, you can only be as good as your worst performer. So, if your employees are not performing, it's the manager's fault. But that is not how it works at Gilead.

Politics is the key. Even if you perform all of your work, someone else will get credit for it. I had the bad experience of showing someone how to perform an assay only to have them get credit for developing it! What a slap in the face! But it's politics, this person's boss was the director's favorite and basically untouchable so there was nothing I could do even though I presented the data to this same group well before this person got credit for my work. 

Oh - do you still want to work for Gilead? Well here is the kicker - I have NEVER worked at a company where people just up and quit! Like ---> quit without having a new job lined up! People become so incredibly stressed they simply can not take it any more and leave.

Please! Do yourself a favor. Do not consider Gilead for employment there are so many other Bay Area companies!

Wed Feb 03 2016, Senior Clinical Program Manager,,Current Employee ,Evil Empire,45,"For those new to management, Gilead has careful curricula centered around all of the soft skills one would need to create a decent foundation in managing people. While it isn't necessarily required that you take them, I do feel that taking advantage of what they offer helps give some support to those new to (or challenged by) line managing others. At least, they do better than assume that once you're a technical expert that you also know how to manage people. 
Gilead does hire generally well, and this perhaps speaks to the success of bringing drugs to market. It just ultimately doesn't respect those hires in the long haul.
","Senior management (Directors on up) should be required to take extended versions of Gilead's management training. No matter what you are told when you come on board, Gilead does not care about you. While this might be true of most companies in a corporate system, most of them aren't this blatantly hypocritical. This company will chew you up and spit you out without blinking. The core values are a joke; brainwashing in place to keep the junior staff in line and rarely evidenced by senior management. In fact, quite the opposite. Middle management (me) has to tow the line no matter what. It's not about doing your job well, it's about kowtowing to your manager and making them feel powerful and in control, and making sure you are falling in line. Saving face. Looking good. Putting other people down. Scapegoating. Those are the real Gilead core values. This is the first place I have worked where there merit doesn't really factor into the equation - it's about who likes you. In fact, if you try to do something to help your department or company, those are the very they will find a way to admonish you for. (At other companies, these types of efforts are usually lauded.) If your goal is to be king of the nerds with your grown up version of mean girls, (and you think this is more important than relationships with OLs or helping patients, or even growing and developing your people) then Gilead is the place you for you. But be careful and watch your back. Everyone there - everyone - all the way on up the chain, has to watch their backs. You fall out of favor one day and you are O-U-T out. In clinical operations, your senior management will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat - I have seen it happen time again to colleague. It's as if Gilead takes it's people - it's most valuable resource - and just crushes the soul of of them. At Gilead, there is no real acknowledgement of success; rather a focus on just ""areas for growth"" and ""development opportunities"". Who cares about what you actually did? It's all about how much sunshine you blew your manager's (and his/her manager's) way.

Although, the stock hasn't performed well the company is making significant strides in the health sciences with its drug offerings.
","The management attempts to adopt the mentality that Gilead is a start-up, without the incentives that most start-ups adopt for employee retention. The organization is run very lean (but very top heavy with contractors). Within IT for every 1 employee there are 4 contractors. The organizational maturity is very low: projects are mismanaged and poorly budgeted by the PMO, there isn't a formal Enterprise Architecture practice, and management is misguided in that all they care about is the work vs an equal balance of people, work/life, and compensation/recognition (common complaint in the surveys is that workers feel burnt out, but nothing is ever done). Bonuses are generally capped, there is typically no recognition a job well done or going above and beyond, and it is very difficult to obtain a promotion even if you are performing the duties of the next grade up. In comparison to other Biotechs in the Bay Area compensation is very low (ex. Take a look at Genentech's compensation to establish a baseline).

","There's quite a few. First, Gilead runs so lean that its tough to keep your head above water. They have a term called ""Responsibly Lean"", which to senior management must mean ""Let's stretch everyone so thin they don't have time to think about how bad this is."" Terrible work-life balance and extremely inflexible to new ideas such as compensatory time after traveling or telecommuting. Very hard to get promoted. Very political senior management. Terrible at acknowledging a job well done - in 3 years I've been told ""good job"" once. Management unresponsive to change. Over half the company has been here for less than 3 years, most likely due to high levels of burnout.

","Can't speak for other dept., but IT is the worst and lowest professional place I've ever worked at. Mid management don't know what they are doing, but keep fixing and patching things. Leadership can't say or don't want to share what IT's core business is. Project gets delayed so they blame other functions. They try to run an IT delivery model that converts IT dept. into a ticketing system, and forcing business to use only three vendors which no one know who they are and how they are qualified. One mid manager terrorizes the whole place by using endless escalations, complaints, and bad-mouthing. CIO had a great vision of changing the place, but implementation deviated to disaster. It used to be a good place to go to work, but now it is soaked with ego, ignorance, finger-pointing and fear. This place is a big time waster for IT professionals who wants to develop skills and career path because you don't learn any new technologies here, and you pretty much have no place to go up as 70% of headcount is contractors, and the rest of 25% act as HR busy hiring contractors to do the job.

","Gilead is intense, with short timelines, too few people and apparently no interest in retention. Also, the company has recently changed focus and has hired a lot of new people. This has changed the environment into one that has more of a big Pharma feel. Finally, Gilead is not a very creative company. It is very good at cranking out drugs but suspicious about pursuing less well validated targets. The result of this is that we seem to end up with better drugs than the competition but rarely with drugs that are completely new.

Working for the company is fulfilling in that sense, and the resulting stock price is a great benefit as well. There are some very talented and awesome people that work throughout the organization.
","Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the benefits at this point. The Business Operations and Contract Compliance department has grown over the past year and the management in place is clearly in over their heads, whether they want to admit it or not. Existing management is severely unqualified to handle the development of processes as demand for new products/contracting grows, and they are unable (or unwilling) to develop their talent at lower levels. This department has continuously under-leveled people to get them in with assertions that the ability to grow and/or seek opportunities around the organization is possible. I have not seen one person be able to accomplish this. There is a clique of people in upper management and, unless you agree with them and support their disjointed ideas, you are outcast and made to feel truly miserable in the workplace. Promotions are not based on merit, but rather if there is a need for a higher level on the team. So, if you are over-performing in your job and satisfying the job duties for a position above your's (which is what is required for a promotion), you are essentially working against yourself because the incentive is not there for management to create a higher leveled spot on the team. If you want to go to Gilead for the name on your resume, this department might get you that. But if you want to develop a career here, you are wasting your time. The morale is very low and people are collectively unhappy.

They are always hiring, due to the high turnover rate. In recent years, the stock price has been doing well.
","When there is a management challenge, instead of having a conversation with the employee and trying to manage the problem, they made their lives miserable to get them to quit. Management expressed extreme pride in how efficient they were as compared with companies like BMS, J&J, etc For example, when people would ask about getting more resources, they would say, ""where are you from? Oh, for 5 of them, there is 1 of us."" Although HR usually is there for the company and not really for the employees (with the exception of a few companies), it is never as true as it is here. Don't bother bringing any issues to HR. It would be more productive for you to spend your time searching for another job, although due to how many hours you have to work here, you probably won't have the time. Work-life balance doesn't exist here and you shouldn't even breath a word of it or you will be fired or made to wish you were dead.

","The company's business model is ""acquisition/licensing - development"". Drug discovery is a joke. Long term pipeline seems to be strong on numbers, but it's actually very weak if you look into it and know what you are doing. The scientific concepts and practices are far behind.

I am surprised that strong as the Gilead CEO, he'd allow such a weak drug discovery operation even at the leadership level. Perhaps he doesn't care given the business model. But I don't think this is good for the long term health of the company - this is the reason I disapprove the CEO.

The culture is poor. Politics and unspeakable secrets are everywhere. I understand that the top management wants to have a ""small company with big pharma's resources"". But look at the company today. Look at what's happening. You are challenged by big pharma problems, and in my opinion, perhaps the problems are more severe than those big pharma with clear processes, personable HR support, and an open culture. I agree with the other posters - don't talk at coffee machine. Don't challenge. - you will be burned if not muted.

The culture is the reason for the high turnover rate. Gilead employees are a group of hard working but unhappy people - well perhaps not those surrounding the top management. Unhappy people work, fight, burn out, and then they leave.

The company has had a good run. Let's contiunue this for the long term.

Nothing makes me feel better than to look at the eyes or hear some heart warming thank you for the person the medication Gilead developed helped. As this company grows fear of layoffs are very slim.
","One of the most challenging things to handle at Gilead is the culture. It is not a very relaxed environment. Everyone seems to be working on the anxious level and always scared. Gilead is very proud of the fact that they work lean which means you do the job of 3 people and are always behind the 8 ball.

People never feel a sense of accomplishment because they are always overwhelmed with work and depending on the department promotions are not given appropriately. Gilead demands a lot and not everyone can handle it.

Just because you work lean doesn't mean that is smart. Showing that you have been hiring does not matter either because if you are expanding therapeutic areas then yes you need to hire more people to cover those areas.

Realize that your pipeline of people with strong pharma experience is limited so burning out hard-to-recruit talent is not in your long term benefit. Do not sacrifice the welfare of your staff just to meet arbitrary timelines. Establish REASONABLE timelines based on your AVAILABLE RESOURCES. Have some infrastructure to train junior staff that can contribute in the long run as most senior level talent avoid Gilead due to your sweatshop culture. Chronic 60-80 hour work weeks is not acceptable for most people. Working Gilead lean is really skeletal lean (working people to the bone).

Super wired culture. Maybe this is just our team but I hardly find myself engaged in the team.

They made a hell lot of money but employees don't get pay well unless you're in senior mgmt plus level. That's why they lost many talents who went to Genentech (which normally pay 15～25 percent more)

Yet, every time she is considered internally, the decision is they want to pay cheaper. Some scientists internally would like to work with this candidate. This position has been posted for two years.

Another candidate was told post-interview, that he was passed over because they want to sponsor somebody for a visa so they will be more appreciative for a job and not be interested in a promotion.

Advice to Management
Work on keeping good managers - ask the rights questions to your employees about their working environment and their managers's behavior. Do some clean up - also, keep in mind that people are scared of losing their jobs, so whatever you do has to be done correctly- not just a survey every 3 years or a 360 peer review, BUT a skip level or one on one with HR.

","Never seen so many unhappy people. They all tell you that they stay for the money. Promotion are attributed for seniority or politic reasons rather than concrete contributions. The management methods are from the last century: lack of transparency, no respect for subordinate or co worker, new idea are not welcome. 
The main moto seems to be absorb any credit you can and reflect all blame... As a result people are very reluctant to work as a team and back stabbing happen at every level.

","Anachronistic, title-aware and oblivious to life-work balance. There is an odd propensity to assign complex tasks to untrained or inexperienced roles, and trivial tasks to senior roles. The claim to be lean is counterintuitive, as the overhead associated with mismatched talent to task surely costs more than truly being lean. Middle management is unfortunately the worst in perpetuating this mindset, as they are the worst trained of them all.

And, building on previous reviews, yes, it is a clique-driven culture. Old-boys network, and sorority-flavored among the women. There is an inclination to hire young interns, with a brainwashing philosophy.

Fri Dec 14 2012, Manager,"Foster City, CA",Former Employee ,No Work/Life Balance,6,"* Great products 
* Good people at the individual contributor level
* Good benefits: 401-K, gym, cafeteria, happy hour Fridays, van pool, etc.
* Ideal for someone right out of college with a lot of drive that doesn't mind putting in 60+ hour weeks to get a fair amount of experience.
","* Extremely heavy work load plus a large amount of vacancies means that 1 person is usually doing the job of 2-3 people. Not unusual to see people in the office past 7pm on Friday night. Very little reward or recognition for such work as it becomes the new norm. 
* Constant reorganizations combined with vacancies make it extremely difficult to maintain any momentum.
* Gilead is a data-driven company for better or worse. Most people promoted into managerial positions are promoted for their technical skills instead of their managerial skills. Most managers seem ill-equipped with the interpersonal and management skills to be effective leaders and the company does little to reprimand or correct such behaviors.

Value the people who do the actual work not those who report progress to you. Many great people have been lost because their managers don't know how to manage and who to recognize. Get rid of the dead weight cause the only thing they can do right is play the politics.

Expansions in to HCV and other areas seem well underway. Employee compensation and benefits are top-notch.
","Company is running way too lean and workload seems unevenly distributed and can be very high for a lot of individuals. A lot of mid to senior managers practice fear-based and non-forgiving types of cultures. They tend to always find someone else to blame (including their own employees!) and only care about their own growth (aka ""manage up"").
Advice to Management
Middle managers need to learn to take proper responsibilities and act like people managers. Sabotaging your own employees to get ahead or to rid of pressures is NOT sustainable. It is also irresponsible for the company. This type of practices, if continued can lead to more people start to leave when the market picks up. Because it may not be worth it for a lot of people to put through high workload and not being treated fairly.
