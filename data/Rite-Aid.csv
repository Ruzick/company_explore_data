Advice to Management
My advice to management would be to hire a third party company to handle your freshness outdates. Your stores are not getting replenished properly because the managers are too busy trying to keep up. You should also take an extra two minutes to strategize your vendor deliveries. Many of the stores are struggling to put away vendor deliveries that all arrive on the store's truck day. At the very least, NO Coremark order should arrive on truck day. Think!

Advice to Management
This is directed to the higher ups in the company. Management isn't an issue at all. The people that work for this company are hard working and deserve a lot more than they receive. Pay should be better, shifts should have better coverage. HOURS! Provide hours for people. Two techs on with one pharmacist in a store that services over 300 customers a day need more assistance than that. You should be making a work place that people want to stay in and build a better relationship with the community because of familiarity. I realize this is a corporation and community isn't what they are looking at in the end. People matter though. It should be said.

I got promoted a few months ago and they told me that they only increase the pay from cashier to shift supervisor by a dollar. If you considering all of the responsibilities that a shift supervisor with only one cashier on duty has to deal with its just not worth it. Also since Rite Aid is now rebranding their stores they now have weird hours and they also don't pay a difference for the overnight shift vs the day shift. It does make sense why I should want to be there in the night working while everyone else is sleeping knowing that I could still get the same hours if I work during the day. I work 39.50 hours because my job is not allowed to give overtime and I still can't make enough money to pay my rent on a one bedroom apartment.
Advice to Management
Pay your overnight stockers, the people who work on profit planners and sales tag before regular store hours a bit more because if you don't more people will be coming on this site to find new jobs 
Also, consider bumping the shift supervisors' pay to $2 instead of $1. That will make your employees know that you care and it will make you look good. That way more people will want to stay longer with Rite Aid.
In my interpersonal communication class, my professor told us about Richard Branson. He makes his employees happy and his employees make him happy and that's how he makes more profits.

","at 18 years old and a full time college student i did more work there than any other employee. extremely stressful work environment, toxic and negative. a woman who was more than 10 years older than me was hired into a lower position than me and started a nasty rumor about me and my personal health, telling other coworkers and even customers (it was 100% not true and she completely made it up for absolutely no reason). i went to HR about it and they did absolutely nothing. wouldn’t even investigate it. my rite aid was located in a not so great part of town, people tried to fight me a lot, threatened me, screamed in my face. according to company policy i’m not allowed to react. if i do, i’m fired. we also couldn’t deny service for customers not wearing a face mask. customers would get in my face with no mask and scream at me if i asked them to put a mask on. all of my coworkers wore their mask below their nose and just had their masks completely off in areas like the office or stock room. made me very uncomfortable. also the company became very micromanaged shortly before i quit. upper management would give us ridiculous deadlines that were impossible to keep up with. i worked here for almost 2 years and over those two years my pay went from $10 to $12. only because i said if i didn’t get a $2 raise i would quit. mind you everyday i came to work after going to school all day and did as much work, if not more, as the store manager. i asked for another raise and was denied. so i quit. also i think their charity “kid cents” is a scam.

Advice to Management
Make sure the managers you have are being supportive and communicating with your team. Ive overheard managers talking bad about me and cussing me out behind my back because I did a task that they felt was not as important as others at the time. Not very manager like and could have been solved if they asked me to do a different task at the time. At one store there were 4 people doing all the work,while the rest got away with barely doing much besides checkstand. There needs to be a lot more coverage as well. Lastly, any stores with a PAC position need to make sure the PAC is being treated as such. My experience with PAC was me being a supervisor/cashier/pac. I had to do a lot to make sure my PAC duties could be completed while working with the other workload management gave to me.

-Front end associates work harder than managers but get less benefits
-Often find yourself clock-watching 
-Must be able to multitask 
-Depending on your shift you may get all of the work while other employees stand around for their entire shift. For example at my store for a long period I only worked Friday-Monday, all of the difficult store tasks such as stocking all of the new shipments and taking down/putting up sale occur during these days. You will be expected to complete all of those tasks (usually by yourself depending on the store and manager) while also taking care of the register. At times it can be overwhelming and stressful for the entire shift while somebody who works on a Tuesday for example will spend their shift doing nothing for hours at a time. You will get no extra compensation or recognition despite working much harder than others.

Tue Jun 23 2020, Shift Supervisor,"Virginia Beach, VA",Current Employee ,"Good starter job, if you want to work",0,"A generally positive work environment awaits you at any Rite Aid location.

Decent employee discount.

Put your best foot forward, do your work, and you'll get a pat on the back and opportunities for promotion.

Provided you give adequate lead time for time off, scheduling is flexible.

Scheduling can vary from week to week, but you can easily get 35-40 hours per week if you want it. 

Fair benefits and paid vacation time.
","Reason that I say ""fair benefits"" is that they do take quite a bit from your paycheck should you opt in for health insurance and the like, and even then it's not very good insurance.

Rite Aid is the lowest paying pharmacy chain, usually you only get 1 raise a year and it usually isn't very large, and be careful when or if you choose to pursue a promotion.

Usually corporate will lump your annual raise AND your promotion raise into one raise, and it would not be as much as if they had been separate.

Paid vacation time is only for full time associates that have worked for Rite Aid at least 1 year.

Since Rite Aid pays less than most other chains, some stores have the tendency to take any help that they can find sometimes, and it would turn out that many new hires are inadequate to perform the necessary work.

As such, some locations have a high turnover rate leaving Shift Supervisors, Assistant Managers, and Managers to have to retrain new people more often than I feel we should.

I feel that members of Corporate Management above the Regional level do not care about the well being of those below them.

Upper Corporate Management is responsible for the layoff and outsourcing of our ENTIRE IT Department, which is a stupidly bold move in my book.
Advice to Management
Pay everyone at Store Level at least 25% more, increase your benefits coverage options while lowering paycheck deductions, increase the employee discount percentage to at least 30%, and Rite Aid will be a more attractive place to work than it is currently.

This will also attract better employees in the process.

Bring back the old IT department and ditch HCL Technologies!

One of the lowest pay rates I have seen for pharmacy technicians now that I am looking for a new job
Advice to Management
Focus more on your higher-selling items like vitamins and first aid, cut the junk items like gardening supplies and dishware because nobody goes into Rite Aid to buy those items. If they happen to walk down that aisle to look at the items, they leave due to high prices. Those items can just be cut from shelves leading to lower costs of things that DO sell, leading to less stores forced to close like mine due to high expenses on unnecessary things. 

Also, pay pharmacy staff what they are worth. You claim that 80% of Rite Aid income in any given store comes from pharmacy, yet you topout your Pharmacy Assistants at like $14 an hour (in my state) and Technicians around $19 an hour. This does not keep staff interested for long. High turnover is in large part due to income concerns. You are battling not only retail competitors but hospitals and clinics that can afford to pay these in-demand positions what they are worth. Loyalty to Rite Aid is easy to develop and hard to keep and you can start with that basic living need.

Advice to Management
Better train your ambassadors so they understand their job duties and aren't just walking around aimlessly or stuck at a register. REMEMBER AMBASSADORS YOU ARENT PAID AS CLERKS SO DONT ACT LIKE IT BECAUSE RITE AID DOESNT APPRECIATE IT AND GOD FORBID YOU CONTACT THE UNION FOR THAT RAISE BECAUSE YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TRASH. Also train the front end and pharmacy personnel on ambassador duties so they know and understand their purpose. Don't allow your front end to use an ambassador to do load in the start of flu season which is ridiculous. Also, instead of making ambassador conference calls and expecting us to relay messages to everyone else, you as management also send an email to your pharmacy & front end managers on what we should be doing every so often.

Mon Feb 25 2019, Certified Pharmacy Technician,"Chesapeake, VA",Former Employee ,Highly Skilled Labor For Almost Minimum Wage,5,"The main reason I stayed with the company for nearly 4 years were that I had a very flexible schedule and I loved my coworkers. I also genuinely enjoyed working as a pharmacy tech. It was easier to request time off for holidays than at previous employers.
","The wages are disgustingly low for skilled labor that requires you to have a certification and involves something as sensitive as handling medication and confidential healthcare records. Opportunities for advancement were slim to none and the annual review process by default awarded a whopping 2% raise regardless of how hard you may have worked. We were also increasingly pressured to fill my prescriptions with fewer tech hours and, once again, wages did not adjust in proportion with these expectations. I watched the morale of my immediate supervisor and fellow techs rapidly deteriorate accordingly. There was also an irritating emphasis on trying to up-sale by pushing flu shots on to customers who usually just seemed annoyed, and yet there was no tangible monetary incentive to do so for anyone other than upper management. Oh wait, my mistake: techs were offered the exciting prospect of a whole $100 if we exceeded their unrealistic expectations (a process that would occur over the course of an entire season). While tech wages stagnated, the CEO gave himself multiple pay raises. If you want a concise illustration of everything wrong with capitalism, look no further than Rite Aid!

","The training they provide is VERY little, which is definitely needed in this kind of work environment. The store I worked for was short staffed so the pharmacy manager would have me skip the time I was scheduled to train to just work where I was needed. Because of the lack of training, I wasn’t as knowledgeable as the other pharmacy techs and this led to me asking questions to avoid making errors. But most of the staff and coworkers were very unfriendly and unapproachable, so communication was very difficult.
