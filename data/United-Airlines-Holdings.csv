Advice to Management
Get new management that takes a real interest in your department. Get your staff including directors, supervisors and managers to set the standard and stop talking about each other and creating a toxic workplace environment- or reprimand them.
Listen to your staff and treat them as equals instead of seat fillers. 
Clean house because you can’t change some environments with outdated views/stuck in their ways.

- Promotions are dangled in front of you. Run, hamster. 
- You are just a number to them. Your own director may not even know your name.

","Don't be fooled by the guise of being unionized - the Union is not there to protect you. They are in the pocket of the company first and foremost, only helping fellow flight attendants when it's convenient for their agenda. The Union is a huge con because it costs each flight attendant $600/year out of their own pocket, just so they can do nothing for them. That money goes straight into Sara Nelson's pockets. So here I am in a pandemic, facing a lay off - all because I made the horrible, life changing mistake of choosing United over Delta. I chose United for the union protections, thinking of job security. Yet it's Delta who will be laying off ZERO flight attendants, and United who will be kicking anyone junior to 1999 to the curb.

And this includes taking racism from your coworkers especially pilots who are treated as if they can do no wrong.

No one between the ages of 18- 35 Are Actual United Agents. Ages 18-35 only throw Bags. The employees that throw Bags are paid minimum wage. They have to work 15 hours or more to makeup for the minimum amount of money they get paid. They hire 18-35 employees left and right through a third party.

One can choose the department that one wants to work in and with many areas we get the exposure to all the departments . Fast paced environment and time flies by . This year we had a very challenging and interesting summer and bad weather days but we persevered , and i feel if I could get through this then I can face any challenge .
At United there is a great feeling of camaraderie . The perks of working at United is that we can get the travel benefits to send our family to any part of the world for free when space is available. 
One gets to meet a lot of people from different cultures and backgrounds .
Would certainly recommend United as a good place to work .
","Very strict about attendance .Can have a lot of mandatory overtime on bad weather days. Sometimes one has to deal with customers who are rude and abusive . This year with so many bad weather days had to work extra hours . To enjoy the travel benefits one has to sometimes wait till the end or get transferred to the next available flight ,so kind of frustrating at times . Have to stand for long hours and deal with crowds .

","I was brought in for a face to face to my interview, asking several IT related questions about the position. They answered them with all lies. I’m a 5 year Desktop Support Specialist Tier II/Network Admin Jr. My resume listed all the IT work I do and so on and yet they hired me within 5 mins after the interview but to be a keyboard commando and my job was to just type all day......A. IT employees rarely spend more than a hour or two a day, and that’s just to close out tickets. This job had nothing to do with IT or Network Administration. I kind of laughed about it on my second day because United is so poor half the letters on my keyboard were missing?? What you can’t even afford keyboards?? I stood up on my second day and asked some of my co-workers if they actually work on computers? Crickets.....So this terrible staffing firm hired me to do a secretaries job. Their was no IT at all involved in this job, by closing time all I could do was laugh as I made my way out to the parking lot.....passing the girl who hired me in the interview.

Pros
Great destinations. Truthfully, that is it.
Cons
Everything else. You are just a replaceable number to UAL. The union is worthless. Travel benefits are useless because the flights are always overbooked. Even medical benefits has dropped from offering several different companies to only one. So it's either choose to have insurance or not. Aircraft are not being maintained properly and constantly in need of repair or cleanings. I can easily say 75% of employees are not happy with UAL.

Tue Aug 13 2019, Social Media Engagement Associate,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Value Your Employees,3,"Amazing teammates really help balance the highs and lows of this job. Given that it's a 24 hour operation, the people on the team become a second family. The flight benefits and flexibility to trade shifts also make this a great job for someone who wants to see the world, while also having the freedom for other commitments. There is an option to work from home if you're on an overnight shift, which is great! You will truly get a sense of how the airline operates and understand the dynamics of different teams, the in and outs of aviation, customer service and daily operations. 

This is a great stepping stone for growing your career, networking and learning social media best practices. I strongly recommend if you're interested in holding a higher title, you seek mentors in other departments and actively volunteer for projects when they arise on the team. Join groups supported by the company and constantly get involved; every interaction is a chance to further promote yourself. I've had many co-workers go on to different teams and say it was a night and day experience. Regardless to if you switch teams or leave the company entirely, you'll come out of the experience having a greater sense of what you want out of an employer. Be patient with yourself, and remember your personal health and growth are most important. Generally speaking, United's community impact and values are amazing, and if you can focus on the larger picture rather than the dynamic of leadership on this particular team, the possibilities are endless.
","Management is the biggest setback of this team, and as a result there's constant re-organization and turnover. General management rarely interacts with associates and is often unaware of daily issues/stress, and tends to avoid conflict. As a result assistant managers are poorly led and can also fail to deliver monthly reviews, support feedback, or maintain consistent and informed updates. Even with good intention, the lack of initiative, fairness or explanation leaves team feeling unsupported and reliant on senior teammates for guidance. The overall lack of transparency when it comes to evaluating performance, merit increases and promotions results in questioning of favoritism, bias and discrimination. 

This role transitioned from Corporate Communications to Contact Centers, and as a result came with some cultural changes. This job is directly centered in customer service, and while there are some appreciative interactions, you do deal with a brunt of anger and disappointed customers. You learn overtime to have a thick skin, however as a 24 hour operation this can be taxing and many have dealt with issues w/ mental health as a result. Your schedule is based on seniority, which could mean working overnights for a prolonged period. For this reason, there's an even greater need to feel supported, and have management present and available to care for the overall needs of each person.
Advice to Management
Listen with actionable ears. You have amazing employees who are ready and willing to go above and beyond for you, however they don't feel valued or treated fairly, which is why your retention is low.

You all often hold associates to a higher standard than you hold yourself and that's not acceptable. You also make acceptations and give leniency to some vs others. Create a standard that enables employees to feel a sense of structure and leadership.

Wed Jul 10 2019, Flight Attendant,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Flight Attendant Job Information,11,"International and Domestic travel benefits for self and family. Flight benefits are dependent on whether there is additional space available on the aircraft. They are called ""Stand-By"" tickets (unconfirmed seats... you get to the gate and put your name on a list... then ONLY if there is space available... you will get assigned a seat/ ticket). Total cost of flights for self and a very select number of primary beneficiaries(I had 3) will cost you approximately 10-15% of ticket price. This percentage can change depending on where you are flying to. I paid $150 for a one way ticket to Tokyo.
","You do not get to directly choose your base location from ALL of the United bases! When you are in training you will be given a list of bases with available flight attendant openings. We were given 6 choices of locations around the United States and asked to rank our preferences. Then when we received our base assignments our entire training group was sent to only 2 of the 6 bases. We were told we could transfer within 6 months. Although this is true... if the base you are wanting to work out of does not have openings you will not be able to go there until space becomes available. Some places have a transfer waiting list of 1,000+ people. All transfers are based on seniority. Also, Flight Attendant Pay does not change whether you are based out of SFO (higher cost of living) or Houston (lower cost of living). Having experienced being based out of both base locations; I can definitely say that a salary of $1,600 a month while living in the bay area should be illegal.

Flight Attendant hourly pay/hours worked need to begin when Flight Attendants are required to report for duty. Currently, Flight Attendant hourly pay/hours worked do not begin until the aircraft door is closed and they end when the aircraft door is re-opened. While a Flight Attendant is between flights, flights are delayed, or is awaiting a flight (in full uniform) we are paid a per diem rate of $1.25 per hour. When I asked management about this being illegal, I was told United operates under old Railroad Laws thus strategically gets away with not having to pay Flight Attendants their hourly rate/hours worked. Here's an example: report for duty time is 6:00am (FA's are expected to be prepared and dressed in uniform.) Customer Boarding time is 7:00am. (FA earns $1.25) Aircraft door closes at 8:00am (FA earns $2.50 for two hours of work) How is this ok? 
This needs to change.

","I was beyond excited and honored to have been called back with an offer. I had been applying for about a year so I was ecstatic. That feeling fizzled away over the humiliating and frustrating 5 months me and my treating Physician were put thru. By the time I was “deemed worthy” to set foot in a training class, my dreams of Having an amazing opportunity turned into feeling like I was not welcome there but they let me thru after I shared what my doctor said about the process I was put through , stating it did not feel equal or right. I’m not a precious snowflake who cannot handle honesty or criticism. But in my 30ish years of working a wide array of jobs in multiple fields , I have never been put through such a drawn out humiliating process involving very private medical information. I was fully cooperative and even suggested ways for them to clear things up. The whole situated took 5 months of not working because I didn’t want to lose my opportunity , being sent back and forth to my doctor, not communicating with me until it was too late to be put in the next class and even coached to change my documents only to make me and my doctor seem like liars. I felt it was a passive aggressive way of trying to get me to give up. Many people I talked to about this agreed that it definitely seemed like the goal of the medical team. I was disappointed and although my mental heath had been in remission for years from depression , it all came back . So , all in all it is a great place to work for if you have never had any issues with your health or your good at lying about them because this is not a friendly place if your honest about any past medical issues. Yes Airlines need to be careful about clearances ( I already have airline experience ) but the drawn out frustrating treatment of my medical information was not necessary. I would have felt better to just have the job offer rescinded rather than feeling like I was a pawn to be played with. Just be careful everyone. I don’t think my treatment was fair meaning they don’t put everyone thru that , just be mindful of what you share no matter how good your intentions are .

","1. Unorganized (No rhyme or reason to training. you have to find your own co workers to shadow. No one explains what they are doing, they aren't interested in welcoming you on to the team.) 
2. Lack of training (What occurs on the floor was not clearly outlined in training. No one Uses system trained on, system uses on the floor different due to tenure employees use what they are comfortable with and not what is currently being taught.
3. Company culture (Employees are mean to each other, still speak of continental/united merger, employees do not respect leads.)
Advice to Management
Structure training. Have daily outlines of what is expected to be covered. Day to day training we did not know what was going it was as if they were winging it.

Have set employees new hires will shadow. We have no direction when scheduled to buddy on the floor. Leads state they didn't know we are supposed to be there and we are left to find nice associates to follow not knowing if they are the proper associates to follow.

Do not wait until a day or two before to release training schedules or changes to schedule. Making arrangements to be available for full time training when hired for part time hours is not easy for those with families. New hires are having a hard time adjusting their work schedules with other jobs or with families bc of last minute changes with no warnings.
