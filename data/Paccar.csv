","1. Salary way below average market rate.
2. You have to wear expensive formal suits no matter what your salary or grade is. They do have discount coupon for some ridiculously expensive store and is practically a joke.
3. Office timing - You are expected to be at work between 7 am to 8 am. Your management will be very unhappy if you try to enter anytime after 8 am. You will have meetings scheduled at 7 am in the morning which you would have to attend in person. If you miss the meeting (even if you have a doctor's appointment) your management will point it out.
4. There is no work from home policy. Even during Covid-19 pandemic employees have to be in office doesn't matter if you are critical or non-critical employee.
5. Nepotism at its best.
6. Unethical hiring practices - even if you have a valid visa and you are LEGALLY eligible to work in USA) - recruiter would ask ""what happens to your visa if your husband loses his job?"", ""What happens if your husband's company decides to not renew his visa?"" etc and then cancel your application. Recruiter would advise hiring managers not to hire people on visa.
7. Employees get promoted only if they are in the good books of the management no matter how (job performance does not matter).
8. They practice lowballing for all positions. Years of experience or education doesn't matter. 
9. Diversity is a joke. Racist and Sexist culture is promoted.
10. Forget getting promoted if you are a woman and have small kids. Female candidates are hired at lower salary than male candidate even if female candidates have higher educational qualification and work experience.

","Not high enough wages for the work you're doing and the cost of living here. Some managers are cancer to your career if you aren't overly buddy buddy with them. Some managers are outright unprofessional in their distaste in employees. HR does not care about legit complaints about coworker and managers who cross the line. HR is more in control than managers when it comes to your reviews. They only allow probably 5% of employees a ""exceeds expectation"" review. Everyone else gets ""meets expectation"" or worse. You can go WAY above and beyond but you will never get recognized for it. Most people there talk trash about technicians compared to engineers.

","This place has really gone down the COVID toilet the past 6 months. Management refuses to let employees work from home citing “decreased productivity” even though they can provide no proof whatsoever of it. Blaming work from home orders for poorly run program management on multi-year projects.

Instead, they would rather pack us into an office without masks, proper ventilation or windows that actually open (all things that the CDC warns against doing).

Forcing those who want to continue working from home to provide doctor’s notes explaining why they are at-risk and cannot be in the office. And then shaming them for wanting to keep their loved ones safe “everyone else is in the office, why aren’t you here, you must not be as dedicated.”

Blatant disregard for Governor’s CDC guidance encouraging office workers to work from home. We can all do our same job at home, but management would rather pack us into an office because they don’t trust us (and they continue to operate like it was 1950).

CEO sent out a fraudulent all employee email pretending to allow “all non-factory workers” the “option” to work from home...but every individual manager says “that directive doesn’t apply to this team.” The office still remains at 50% capacity despite CEO email. Seemed like a publicity stunt to prevent some of the hemorrhaging in workforce. Morale is at the lowest I have seen in 10 years. 

Lots of quality people are quitting and seeking employment elsewhere because they can’t put up with the lack of humanity anymore.

I strongly encourage you to NOT work here. Find a company that cares about their employees as human beings (literally every other company is making work from home optional at this time). Working here will probably end up getting you sick, too bad management won’t even care.

","No leaders, just a company of managers who do what they are told, without thinking, and never hesitate to throw employees under the bus. Everything is sales driven, so true optimization is never the goal. Managers spend their time micro-managing and trying to fake the metrics so they look good to upper management. PACCAR claims to be a technology company but uses systems from 30+ years ago and did not even have the ability to forward office phones when employees worked remotely during COVID-19 (still doesn't). The company forced employees to continue to go into the office until someone tested positive for COVID-19 (nearly a month after most other companies allowed employees to work remotely). Zero flexibility - Employees were not allowed to work remotely before COVID-19 and they are pushing to get people back into the office ASAP. Managers expect employees to arrive at work at the exact same time every day and they will reprimand employees who arrive just 5 minutes “late” or leave “early” (but they have no problem expecting you to work late) and monitor when employees log on/off, etc. during COVID-19. The worst is that managers talk about employees behind their back to other employees on the same team. There are other things like business attire and men need to shave, but those didn't personally bother me. 

PACCAR has many “unspoken rules” like all high-level individual contributors and managers are expected to either have, or pursue, a master’s degree, most commonly an MBA. it is OK if you do not have one, but you will be expected to get one (yes, they will ask when, not if, you are going to get it). They also expect employees to participate and donate a certain amount to benefit events and they measure your success on that. If you do not play their games, they will block any advancement or movement.

Sat Mar 16 2019, Engineer,"Kirkland, WA",Former Employee ,Worst firm ever; management. PACCAR - Let go the undesirables.,16,"Regular paycheck, clean environment, and quailty product brands. Very large firm and chance to position yourself.
","This employer puts employees down and makes them either feel less than valuable.; uses opportunity to discard anyone deemed as less than desirable. The method for this is the review process. PACCAR use yearly goals for employees and then rate one as meets needs or exceeds. I know of a pair of cases where managers were told they needed to rate an employee specifically (which employee stands out the most and which employee does not). If a person was too quiet and not well known in round table discussions a manager could claim: "" this employee is my least _____"". If nobody spoke up (to counter or defend) then merit would be given to the manager if they fired the employee. At PACCAR interviews you may be asked if you have ever had to fire someone. With such a large head count you will need to master this skill! Further: In order to fire that person in one case I saw the manager had no real reason (employee was never tardy, never used substances, was simply not someone that could be outright fired); hence the manager attempted a scheme: task the employee with difficult projects well above their level/pay grade and maybe they will fail or leave on their own. In one case that backfired for the said manager as the employeee did the task so well, that they became noticed and were a standout. Still not wanting the employee as driven on the merit that ""if I fire the person I will apply for a Director job promotion"", the manager gave the employee goals that simply could not be accomplished. Simple goals but steered the employee into failure by telling them ""not to worry about completion"" of a said goal at present time, ""we shall complete it at a later date"". This then, during the goals review was reversed where the manager said to the employee "" you failed to meet the goal"" his or her goals causing or resulting them a NEEDS rating in the review. 
This at PACCAR immediately throws one into a PIP which is a ""you will improve or else we will fire you"". It is an incredibly painful process that requires the employee to go through PACCAR counseling meetings where a manager and or an assigned employee is tasked to scrutinze the emoyee asking them: What they know about the firm; Why they are here to begin with, how they plan to succeed, and whether they can succeed. The whole time there is no improvement plan as likely there was no merit to the PIP! In the case of one employee I knew, their review was tendered a NEEDS but the employee (then led by a different manager) was found to have no such deficiencies by their new manager. The said former manager however, communicated displeasure about his former employee to the new team manager in closed door meetings and the PIP was a formality (meant nothing) and in time they were let go.
The unfortunate issue with this particular case is the employee was there several years with good reviews at PACCAR and it was a particular manager that he transferred into (to work for) who needed to fire the undesirables (PACCAR rule) so he was setup to be fired.
PACCAR - Let go the underisables.
I can recall another case where an employee was forced out when he became ill from a terminal disease. The cruelty of PIP harassment was applied to this same person and they were forced to retire/leave even though the employee saud they did not want to for financial reasons.

The issue with the tactic of removal of employees is not the purge of poor employees but the merit a manager receives if they do so; a promotion etc. The problem being a lot of good employees are let go if they are ""unnoticed"", ""quiet"", ""not well known"", the boss does not like them"". I saw in one case a colleague was placed on a PIP even though there was no evidence for it.
PACCAR Culture:
The things you have read or heard about ""not using the elevator (engineers must use stairs), engineers shall wear ties, engineers must become clean shaven during opcom visits"" are absolutely TRUE! Those things are part of the Piggott familly tradition at KW in Kirkland, WA and you need to learn to swallow the PACCAR koolaid.
Bottom line:
Really bad place and bad experience; advice = stay away!

Tue Dec 18 2018, Engineering Manager,"Mount Vernon, WA",Former Employee ,Not the Best for Everyone,23,"This review is for the PACCAR Technical Center in Mount Vernon, WA, although I’m sure that most of these points apply to any of the PACCAR facilities located in NW Washington. I’ll split this review into 2 sections depending on if you’re an engineer or a manager. As there are upsides and downsides to working at any company, here’s a brief overview of what to expect so you can decide if this is really the best fit for you.

**ENGINEER**
This place is for you if:
-You prefer to keep your head down and not make waves.
-You are satisfied with a below-market salary with merit increases that barely outpace inflation.
-You don’t expect to be rewarded in any meaningful way for going above and beyond your job description.
-You can handle doing the work of multiple people day in and day out with very little guidance or recognition from management.
-You have thick skin and strong bones because you’ll be continuously run over by buses and expected to continue on like nothing happened. Remember, NOTHING stands in the way of making money!
-You don't mind not being passed over for promotions, recognition, or jobs by considerably less-qualified people. It's your own fault, after all.
-You're willing to paint your nose brown day-in and day-out to advance your career.
-The ONLY brown part of your body is your nose (pale male applicants only please).

**MANAGER**
This place is for you if:
-You meet the PACCAR definition of a manager: Male, white, incompetent, “yes-man”, and no facial hair below the upper lip (to satisfy our Lord and Savior, Master Mark Pigott).
-OR you’re comfortable being the token diversity candidate so upper management can say “See! Look at him! We don’t have a diversity problem!”
-You’re happy to have no strategic, unified vision for the division you work for, essentially floating rudderless in a sea of your own mediocrity.
-Speaking of, your preference is to reward nepotistic mediocrity and punish those who fail to conform.
-You excel at toeing the company line, even through times of ethical and legal murkiness. Don't worry, you'll be guided by a gaggle of well-paid attorneys to keep PACCAR out of trouble.
-You’re eager to keep secrets and make policies generic and ambiguous so your employees can fail, because hey, what better way to learn, right?
-You’re capable of lifting over 150 pounds so you can swiftly throw your employees under the bus before they realize what’s happening.
","This place is NOT for you if:
-You have any sense of integrity or moral compass.
-You care about people and want the company you work for to do the same.

","There is a huge divide among plant floor employees and office employees. More so because office positions typically all need a college degree, causing opportunities for advancement to be minimum. Negative attitudes and resentment are plentiful. What’s more is that upper management actually takes stabs at employees behind clothes doors. 

The worst experience had to be when my counter part and new boss that had been in a previous position with the company sucked onto one another and became best friends that would talk trash behind people’s backs, throw people under the bus, and pat themselves on the back for accolades they did not achieve or were not worthy of. They continued building one another up while pushing others down. They created a sour work environment that was felt among the entire team and ended up driving employees away from the company.

Management needs to stop trying to control every person's career movement or shift. You need to value your employees and recognize hard workers, and just say thank you. A lot of the managers I encountered were more focused on progressing their own career that they didn't even vouch or talk about the accomplishments their subordinates were doing to leadership. 
Of course they will probably read this and deny everything that is said on here, but what you really need to do is reflect on these issues because these are the reasons why so many people are leaving your company. No reason I should be able to count over 25 people that have left one department within the last year and half when it is only made up of 60 people.

Historically family owned company that is focused on providing steady, solid financial performance. Don't let historical bad reviews scare you away. I've been at Paccar for about a year, and have been pleasantly surprised. The people (at all levels) are focused on improving processes and the company overall. Opportunity to grow/move if you want to, and are willing to work hard. Much has been said about the downside of the culture, and the fact that employees are expected to dress professionally. I take that as pro - PACCAR sells a premium product, and wants employees to display a professional, premium look as well. That's not a bad thing. The expectations aren't that different than if you worked for a bank, consulting firm, professional accounting firm, etc. Employees are empowered to make process improvements, and are rewarded for doing so. On-site (free) workout resources, including indoor basketball/volleyball/tennis court and walking track.
","Cafeteria could be vastly improved, but with downtown Bellevue location, there are lots of other options. As a fiscally conservative company, upgrades to non-product technology sometimes seem to lag behind the times (lots of paper processes).

Sat Apr 14 2018,Anonymous,"Renton, WA",Former Employee ,STAY AWAY! DO NOT WORK HERE!,24,"The only pros! It was a regular 9-5 job with weekends off.
","DO NOT WORK HERE! Plain and simple, this is a miserable place to work and you will regret ever applying. Every ridiculous “rumor” you have heard about Paccar is true. 

The seniors leadership team is full of managers who don’t care about anyone except themselves. When things don’t work, instead of finding solutions, they’re too busy trying to find someone to blame and throw under the bus. They don’t appreciate any work you do; you’re basically just a number to them. It’s almost better to be lazy at Paccar. You get away with it, disciplinary action is never taken, and you still get paid. 

There has been extreme turnover in the last two years. To add insult to injury, they take at least 2+ months to fill any position. So if someone leaves your department, good luck staying afloat. You’re stuck doing their job for at least a couple months...and that’s if they decide to fill the role. Often times, they conclude they can do without so their tasks get distributed among whoever is left. It’s absolutely awful! 

When job postings go up, don’t bother applying. Management only posts them for protocol. In their minds, they already know who they will promote. If you’re not part of their “Master Plan”, you will not get the job no matter how well you do in the interviews. 

Lastly, I would highly discourage you from applying here if you’re non-white, female, you outwardly display your religious beliefs. Anything that shows you’re different is more grounds for management to treat you like an outcast who is not worthy of any respect. 

I hope every unhappy person here finds the courage to apply for new jobs. Paccar is not worth the stress and unhappiness.

","Working at Paccar Parts is like reliving high school except it's a job. You are either part of the ""cool kids club"" and with membership receive lavish public attention in all employee meetings, raises, bonuses, perks etc..., or you are literally cast out into the street. Managers will make statements to you in front of others like ""You are part of the family"" but act in a more hostile and childish manner towards you in private. The hard truth is that members of the management team at Paccar Parts really don't like one another or work well together. It's a safe assumption based on observation that managers including members of the SLT do not want to work for Paccar Parts but they are too vested in service time or too scared to jump ship and work somewhere else. Instead, they look for someone (preferably a new hire) to pass on blame as to why their division/work group is not performing. Management rolls out the red carpet for interns by giving them unlimited access to company parties, Mariner games and access to site leadership such as one on one meetings with the division president and directors. Regular Full Time Employees who are actually hired to do a specific job and hit payroll, not so much. 
Employees with seniority are basically allowed to do whatever they want (poor attendance, poor attitude, poor work performance, etc..) but new hires are told without provocation that they are lucky to be here and to sit down and shut up. 
There is no room for new ideas, different concepts or incorporating best practices from other companies or industries. You do as you are told, or else.. because as my former manager told me ""I could have hired someone else for your role here.""

Fri Nov 10 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Mediocre,21,"Work Life Balance is great (as a salaried, non-manager technical employee). Seldom is overtime expected and the work load is seldom overwhelming (the one exception I witnessed to this was for production-related positions which is to be expected).
 
Employment: if you are salaried, chances are you will not ever be fired. (There are some obvious pitfalls to this practice, namely tons of deadweight).

Resources: it's a big company, so there are many opportunities for professional training: technical classes such as CREO/CAD, GD&T, Green and Black Belt certifications as well as industry-specific training in material cost excellence, leadership training, etc. For the most part the content of such classes is quite good (implementation, well that's a whole different beast).

Given the low overtime expectations and the stability of employment, you could say that their salary and benefit packages are appropriate.
","There is no expectation for things to be done the right way. I’ll go further, there are no incentives or rewards for doing things the right way. I’ll go even further, there is a tacit and widespread hostility towards doing things the right way. The real priority is doing what you are asked to do without questioning it and being able to report that all your goals are being met. 

The result is an eerie mentality where the goalposts are shifted, inconsistencies are overlooked and everything that does not add up is rationalized away. Aside from the relatively few who are discontent within the organization everyone else adopts a version of ‘things are not perfect, but where are they anyway?’ and implicitly or explicitly condone the way things get done.

The ensuing dynamics are those of expedient problem-solving by management in order to present a situation under control, frustration or impotent resistance by those employees unwilling or unable to overlook the duplicitousness of the whole culture and indifference or complicity by everyone else.

For me, one of the most difficult consequences to live with was the lack of pride of workmanship. The norm is just to do things and not ask any questions. Further, there were very few, if any, opportunities that actually allowed for ‘good work’ to be done; most positions being tailored around unrealistic or ineffectual job descriptions, responsibilities or expectations. 

Another noteworthy consequence is the inability of the company to attract and retain talent. If you’re looking for motivated, talented employees looking to do good work, this is not the company for it. I met only two managers who I looked up to in my entire stay and both of them were senior managers who arrived at the company after having made their careers elsewhere and who by this point were simply finishing it off in a comfortable note prior to retirement.

This is a place where mediocrity abounds. most live comfortably next to it, some fight it to no avail and yet others embrace it full-heartedly.

Bottom Line:

There is something to be said about stability and 40-hour-week expectations. If all you want is a ‘job’ then look no further than PACCAR. If right now what you really need is stability or a leg-up, then PACCAR is a decent bet. Just be aware of the risks and drawbacks going in.

If you’re interviewing, I’d suggest you be very skeptical about any job descriptions, expectations or promised opportunities – an opportunity to fix ‘____’ means something very different inside PACCAR than outside it. So I would suggest you get as specific an answer as possible (anything that veers into the opportunity to do ‘projects’ should be are red flag).

Also, do not underestimate the effect of the culture on your mental health. Even if you are a laid back, flexible person the requisite load of mental gymnastics may come to eventually affect you. I’d suggest that you assess whether there are any potential areas of conflict where you’d be uncomfortable doing things out of expediency.

Try to assess which skills you’ll be able to develop no matter what and what your exit strategy will be as this place may simply suck you in into professional irrelevancy.

One last note for engineers (of any kind as far as I’m concerned): Be extra careful. The foregoing advise is especially germane to any technical position in PACCAR. In most likelihood you’ll only learn things that are PACCAR-specific so that you may only be ever employable at PACCAR, especially if you are just starting out.

It’s like asking the Fox to guard henhouse.

Broadly speaking, the culture is a self-reinforcing cycle. Yes-men and women are promoted and in turn they promote yes-men and women, none of whom are interested taking apart the papered-over shaky foundations (if for nothing other than to conceal their complicity). 

Just ask any manager and although they all agree that ‘things are not perfect’ not one of them will ever even conceive that they are contributing to the problem. The whole structure is rotten from the core and if you don’t even wince at it anymore then you’ve become an unconscious supporter of the Potemkin-like regime.

Also, as far as I can tell, HR is entirely complicit in this pact, so any feedback will fall in deaf or impotent ears.

Tue May 09 2017, Engineer,"Chillicothe, OH",Former Employee ,"Engineer - Chillicothe, OH",5,"The people are great. The pay is ok relative to the cost of living (Chillicothe, OH). Work life balance (depending on your department).
","Opportunities for advancement:
The company's HQ is in Kirkland, WA where the products are designed and engineered. Being this far way from the plant creates kind of an us verses them culture between the plant and HQ. This culture can be seen in how decisions are made and who gets promoted. If you're an engineer at this location and you want to remain and in engineering, there are not many opportunities for advancement. The only way to get ahead is to go to production and move up the ranks by managing people. If you're lucky, someone will retire and the people below him/her will be promoted, giving you a chance applying for a low level management position. Some management positions at the plant are EXCLUSIVELY for people that come from Kirkland. They are used as rotational positions to get them used to plant operations. While this makes sense on paper, it can leave some employees feeling trapped in dead end jobs.

Culture:
Engineers don't seem to be valued here. A lot of production managers don't have technical backgrounds and they tend to make decisions that make no sense. Part of that probably has to do with the pressure that they receive from their managers, but it's difficult to feel bad for them when they preach one thing and do another. 

Example: In the past several years there has been a big push to implement a LEAN/6 Sigma culture at the plant. This works great at the beginning of the month, but as soon as end of month/quarter comes, the same managers that are preaching 6 Sigma will throw all of that out the window. The only thing that matters then is production numbers. They will gladly build an incomplete product that and has to be towed off the assembly line if it means adding another truck to their end of month numbers. This product will then be completed offline, bypassing several process controls, using overtime labor. 

Speaking of 6 Sigma, it's pretty much a joke. If you're looking to get some 6 sigma experience to put on a resume, good luck. It's basically a glorified savings calculator here.

Work-life balance:
If you work in resident engineering, your work life balance will be relatively good. You can expect to work 7am-3:30pm. The exception to this is if you're one of the few people with electrical knowledge. You will most likely have to work overtime to fix programming or electrical issues that arise when trucks are built without having all the required parts. 

If you work in the manufacturing engineering department, your work life balance will depend on if you have any projects. Most engineers in this department can expect to work several weekends through out the year and almost everyone works a few days during the 2 week long plant shutdown that occurs during Christmas/New Year.

Location:
There's not much to do in Chillicothe.

Pay:
The pay is below industry average for engineers, but most people from the Chillicothe area don't have many other employment options that pay as well as Kenworth. Raises are also terrible.

The Chairman:
This guy is crazy. He has an unwritten rule about facial hair that he tried to enforce one day. He basically told people with facial hair to go home and only come back once they have shaved. He also has a thing against colored thumbtacks. Colored thumbtacks are not allowed; only clear thumbtacks are permitted. There are other stories about him that I can't remember. I'm sure you can find some in other reviews.

If you stay long enough, the pension plan is top-notch and they offer decent other long-term benefits. They also encourage movement within the divisions, so if you like the company as a whole, you can continue to reinvent yourself within the same organization. The CON of this is that they continue to hire employees in director roles that are unqualified for their position. It is perfectly normal to see a directors move from engineering, to marketing, to operations...they see nothing wrong with that.
","The biggest con at PACCAR is the blatant sexism. Recently, the company started diversity councils within each separate division. My council leader is -- you guessed it -- a white man. If you are a white man with at least a basic level of competency, this is the company for you! You will thrive here. If you're not, don't even bother. You'll work three times as hard and be better at your job for less money, fewer opportunities, and little respect. This is top-down problem with the senior management at PACCAR, so it's unlikely to change anytime soon. The culture is the most backward I've ever seen. Senior management is known for throwing coats on women and firing people on the spot. Each floor is dead silent with zero chatter.

Fri Mar 10 2017,Anonymous,"Bellevue, WA",Former Employee ,Loved my job until I told my boss I was pregnant,20,"They really value education, which is about the only good thing I can say about them. They match up to 50 per cent of your tuition for your masters degree or continuing ed (buyer beware, there are tax implications) and you can't get promoted past a certain point until you get your MBA or similar. They value hard academic work.
","I was bullied into quitting. Where do I begin? I loved my job, until I came out as pregnant. Then things got really difficult for me. Management was careful not to do anything actually illegal, but anyone would feel bullied under these circumstances. For example, I was required to take my (TIMED) breaks down in the basement. I had difficulty walking due to my condition, but that didn't matter. Break started when I left my cubicle and I had better be back after 10 minutes. The scheduled lunch hour was exactly the same. I didn't understand why I was not allowed to eat at my desk, while other people were. I was also not allowed to keep personal effects on my desk, or anything. No stacked papers, not even work related. My area had to be kept clear. 

Additionally, I got into trouble if I was ever late. I'm not talking 1 hour late, but maybe 10 minutes; the amount of time it took me to walk from my car and void my bladder on a particularly bad day for traffic. No leniency. 

My manager clearly did not trust me to get my work done and decided that it should take me exactly 8 hours to do my work, so I even had to send an email in the morning proving that I arrived to work on time (when the manager wasn't there). 

The dress code had no leniency for pregnancy, either. That meant I had to buy new clothes often, and couldn't take my jacket off even sitting in my cubicle (because I might show my lady-ness). The dress code specifically says that women cannot wear tight fitting clothing that shows their body--good luck finding professional wear that doesn't show your female body shape while pregnant! The icing on the cake was when they asked me for a proof of pregnancy note from my doctor; I was 8 months pregnant. Take a look at me. 

The policies also systematically discriminate against pregnant women. Need to take off early for a prenatal appointment? Better get your manager's permission first. That also comes out of your sick days. Your FIVE DAYS of sick day per year. I had completely blown through my sick leave before the end of my pregnancy. And no, they don't have any maternity leave policies.

This job was the most constricting and anxiety-ridden salaried job I have ever worked. I think I was treated better working fast food job in high school.

Mon Sep 05 2016, Senior Project Engineer,"Kirkland, WA",Current Employee ,Opportunity to do great things,13,"I love our product. Our trucks are really cool. They are beautiful, massive, and awesome. I have worked at Kenworth, a division of PACCAR, for my entire 22 year professional career and I love this place. So of course, I am completely biased. One of the things that I enjoy about working here is seeing the new designs that I work on rolling down the highway and being a part of building and improving the lives of others, and making the world that we live in a better place. 

Our customers are great. There is no better person to tell you how good something is or how bad it sucks than a truck driver. It is brutal honesty, and I wouldn’t want it any other way! 

I have to say that one of the best things about this company is that we are big enough to do great things, but small enough that we as employees can really make a difference. We work “lean”, meaning that we are asked to do a lot, making it very challenging but also providing a lot of opportunity. I frequently work extra hours and it has been recognized and rewarded. I took advantage of the tuition partial-reimbursement to complete a Master’s Degree which has helped me strengthen my skill-set and I have applied what I learned from both the coursework and my thesis research to what I do everyday. 

I really enjoy the people that I work with and their passion for what we do. One of my fellow co-workers, a group supervisor, recently shared his philosophy of managing his team. He said he doesn’t expect perfection, and knows that people will not get it right every time. He continued by saying what really matters is what they do when something goes wrong. I share his philosophy and believe that it is one of the things that makes us a great company. If things don’t go right we dive in and we make it work.
","PACCAR corporate culture can be bruising to employees based on my own experience. A few years ago I was made aware that one of our senior executives stated that my hair style conflicted with PACCAR’s image and that he wanted something done about it. I’m a 47 year old man and I wear a long neatly braided ponytail. I reported this incident to our HR office and was told “that’s just the way he is” and I was encouraged by HR to leave the building and hide when the executive visited our office. After about seven months of this degrading arrangement I formally submitted a written request for equal treatment and access to the workplace that my fellow employees had. Upon doing so I was warned by the HR office that by making a formal request it would be “career limiting” to me, that it would also negatively impact the General Manager at our location, and that I did not have HR support. Since that meeting I have feared losing my livelihood and have been concerned that by standing up for my beliefs and morals that I was doing damage to leadership team members that I look up to and admire.

I was also among a group of about 30-40 men at our location that were abruptly told to shave our beards. In my case, having worn a beard for almost a decade, I was told that I was violating a policy that had always been in-place, but that had not been enforced. I was given 15 minutes to leave the office, asked to go home and complete my workday remotely using VPN access, and told not to return to work until I had shaved my face. In the few minutes that I had before I left the office I sent an email to the HR manager stating that this policy conflicted with my spiritual beliefs. When I returned to work the next morning I took a signed copy of a request for accommodation, and was told by the HR office “Good luck”. At that point I was in a state of complete confusion, unsure of my status, and feared for my job and my future. 

I have discreetly reached out to PACCAR Leadership over the past few years to advocate for change and for an increased respect for diversity but it has been unproductive.

Occasionally we, as employees, are asked to “expend” our earned vacation in a manner that will benefit the accounting books so that it will show a more favorable financial condition. I will bluntly state that “I AM AN ENGINEER” and this is completely mind boggling. In my world, once something has left the “dotted line” that surrounds a control volume, it is gone. You don’t get to count it again!

Despite my comments here in the “con” section, I do have a very positive outlook for the future of PACCAR. I recently observed an effort by our employees to take a critical look at our work environment and to develop recommendations for improvement. It was inspiring to see the new generation of employees collaborating alongside our tenured staff, and I am particularly impressed with our emerging leaders that are challenging corporate dogma, and are doing so with hard data and a systematic transparent approach.

If you are considering a career with us I encourage you to do it. Bring your toughness, your willingness to never give up, and come join us.

","Bullying is rampant, starting with executives. Middle managers who shame, ridicule and humiliate their subordinates are rewarded as successful. This has led to a toxic and negative work environment. Flexible work hours are highly discouraged at the corporate office. Employees have one hour enforced lunches, but managers in certain departments verbally reprimand ( never in writing) salaried employees for penny pinching on hours by managers if they notice you taking a lunch break everyday. Work process is highly disorganized in many departments making successful completion of projects a rarity in the company. I have waited two years to write a review on this company hoping my opinion would change. It hasn't changed and I'm left with stress related health issues due to a highly toxic environment and 9X5 work weeks.

Within the manufacturing facilities, the engineers and support staff are great to work and you are never too far away from the plant manager if you need to be heard. 
Depending on your team, hours can range from 40 per week to what seems like well over 60-70 with some weekend work. The weekend work is specific to the Manufacturing Engineering and Controls Engineering groups. Software engineers at the manufacturing facilities can expect 40-50 hours per week.

Fri Dec 18 2015,N/A,"Louisville, KY","DYNACRAFT PLANT in Louisville, KY","This is who she meant when Mamma said, ""Stupid is as stupid does,",3,"Dynacraft (a division of Paccar) has a mentoring program that, when it works, provides the employee with guidance towards improving within the company and a strategy for achieving those goals. Unfortunately, when a mentor is promoted (or resigns) they are not replaced, and one is left to muddle through the best one can.
There are a lot of supervisors who care about their team members, sometimes it's enough.
","There is a serious disconnect between first and second shifts.Not only in the way they are treated and in what is expected of them, but also in the consequences of not meeting those expectations. Currently the plant is moving to an emphasis on first shift production, with second shift backing, without seeming to even NOTICE that first shift can not, or will not build at quota. Meanwhile, they move more build teams to first shift, but production does not change. 
The problem will not be solved with more builders, if the supervisors remain the same.

Fri Sep 18 2015, IT Manager,"Renton, WA",Current Employee ,Good company but has work to do,3,"I’ve been with PACCAR for over eight years in IT working with the lowest level to highest level employees. PACCAR is an interesting company, like any other it has good and bad attributes. It is a very stable but can be fiscally and culturally conservative. There is a lot of opportunity to grow your career with the aging of the workforce and legacy technology. If you’re inclined you can champion new technologies and methodologies to help modernize the company. Or try a different career path with the diverse set of businesses that PACCAR is in. While you won’t get paid the same as many of the tech companies in the area you can climb the ladder faster and get a great deal of experience. You have to be the change you want to see in the company and you are responsible for growing your own career.
","PACCAR has been around a long time (110 years!) and is slow to change. PACCAR has a bad reputation when it comes to culture and a lot of that is deserved (read the beardgate reviews on here). You will likely not get the same compensation that tech companies in the area give but you will have a great place to make an impact. I feel that the company is slowly adjusting its culture to the modern work force. If it doesn’t it will have a hard time attracting the next generation as the boomers retire.

Internal movement is encouraged and managers often consider internal candidates prior to external. The company is stable and consistently shows a profit. Employees and management work hard and it shows. This company is lean but done in a way that works very well. Continuing education is promoted and employees have the opportunity to gain a lot of experience if they choose to.
","The culture is still stuck in the 1960's and is pushed from the top down. Men are expected to wear suit and ties, no facial hair, and no visible tattoos. Women are expected to dress the equivalent, leggings if wearing a dress, natural colored hair, and no visible tattoos. Employees are expected to work form 8:00am to 5:00pm at the corporate office which is nice for consistency but is lacking when flexibility is needed. Other offices are on a core hours system which is more appropriate. The dress code doesn't match the surrounding society and PACCAR employees can easily be identified by the style when outside of the corporate office. Few customers dress the same and this becomes obvious during meetings with customers.

","The culture at PACCAR is stifling and depressing. It's quieter than a library the majority of the day with little collaboration. You don't feel like you can express honest opinions to management for fear of being cast out. 

The processes are old and PACCAR does not promote change management whatsoever. The systems don't communicate to each other and the current system is so out-dated that it is no longer supported. We've had so much turnover in IT that they can't even keep up with all the systems issues. 

Low pay for all the responsibilities of the position. And unless you are a white male, don't expect to go too far within the company. Case in point: a former employee of mine, a white male, was promoted 2 levels in pay grade, something I was told in the past was not the way PACCAR operated. That I had to earn my way to the next level and then the next. Should have known they meant because I am female that I was never going to get the same treatment.

Mon Jul 28 2014, Materials Management,"Renton, WA",Former Employee ,BELIEVE THE REVIEWS. THEY ARE TRUE,11,"Paccar is and will continue to be a stable company. If you are young in your career, it wouldn't be a bad place to get some good work experience. Work life balance for NON-managers is relatively good. The benefits are good. The senior management is good. My department manager was excellent. He was a good strategic thinker with vision for the department. He was a good person to be around.
","The pay is far below what you could get for the same job somewhere else. The volume of work they expected was completely unreasonable. I typically worked at least 50 hours a week, and usually more. The amount of vacation is not negotiable, and really stunk when compared with the amount of work I had to get done. Delegating to my exempt employees was hampered by immense turn-over and an extended period of time where I wasn't allowed to fill open positions. The dress code is ridiculous. Your desk is not your own. It needs to be kept in a certain way the company defines as acceptable. It needs to look like nobody is working there and forget bringing in personal items. If you do have them, they need to be put away when the ""Chairman"" is going to be in the building. I could go on, but you get the general idea. The 'culture' is crazy and definitely not for everyone.

Wed Jul 02 2014, Anonymous,"Denton, TX",Current Employee ,"Unless you are a white, male, (preferably an engineer too) - then you aren't leadership material for PACCAR.",9,"Stable company, 401K match, luckily my supervisor is accommodating with flex time as needed. Also, Peterbilt's truly are the best truck on the road & it feels good to have pride in your product.
","Where to start? 

The culture is depressing. I am surrounded by employees who have been with PACCAR for literally decades, who think they own the company & are so grumpy. The long-term employees truly get away with anything & most of them (not ALL) treat you anyway they please, as they feel entitled. 

The reviews are all true, this company operates on fear from Mark Pigott. Too many horror stories about Mr. Pigott to even count. 

If you're a female, best of luck advancing your career because you likely won't. Meaning, the men all promote their male friends & it's a man's world big time here. It's just the way it is. And if you're an attractive female, you will either be shunned & judged for taking care of yourself or gawked at by most of the plant men. 

You will be told you MUST have an MBA for advancement here. And then once you get your MBA, you will have to beat out all the male engineers for positions. 

And yes, the weird facial hair scandal even gave me the creeps & I'm female. How bizarre that men cannot have facial hair? This place is operated like a backwoods cult by a controlling chairman. 

Everyone is married to someone in the plant & their entire family works there too...it's weird to me but maybe that's just me.

3. You quickly seek out like-minded people who you quickly befriend solely based on the hubris of middle-management.
","These ""Cons"" apply specifically to the Information Technology Department (ITD)
1. Middle-management ruins quality workers. I cannot stress this enough. Middle-management needs to be taken out of the corporate structure because a ton of layers of work is already expected just to get the job done.
2. Had it not been for my immediate 2 middle-managers, one for Production Support, and one for Projects (both of which I had to report to multiple times per day), I might still be at the company today.
3. Training was completely OTJ, and there was never any budget for eternal classroom (or even online) SAP training.
4. If you don't drink the Kool-aid, you're immediately an outcast. This happened to me around the end of my first year working there.

My immediate supervisor is very supportive and I like working in his group.
","Oh boy, I'd take several days to write all the cons, however below are a couple of them that I've personally experienced:
1. At the tech-center in Mt Vernon, when ""the chairman"" comes for a visit, everyone right from the general manager to an intern is supposed to be clean shaven and wear formals. A week before his scheduled visit, everyone at the tech-center is busy moving plant pots, pictures hanging on the wall are changed, remodeling the cafeteria, painting the parking lot stripes and so on and so forth. They spend literally thousands and thousands of dollars for half a day of chairman's visit, but they cannot invest small amount of money on buying a decent coffee machine or setting up a gym or a basket-ball court. 
2. Visible tattoos, ear piercings, facial hair is a big no-no. All the guys at the tech-center who decide not to shave their goatee/beard are shoved and locked in a room on the day our chairman comes for a visit. You gotta be kidding me..!! Employees are treated as dirt that can be shoved underneath a carpet.
3. Vacation policy, employee benefits suck big time. Employee salaries are way too less as compared to our competitors or the general industrial rates.
4. Tech-center is advertised to potential customers as a greatest center of innovation and excellence; in-fact tech-center is just there for trouble-shooting of issues in the field rather than and research or innovation related activities. Non existent product development work at the so called ""tech-center"".
5. The company runs ""lean"". Everyone from a manager/supervisor to engineer is supposed to get their hands dirty as the company wants to restrict the number of technicians hired. I don't get it..!!
6. You've to literally beg for the smallest of things to make them happen. Even the supervisors know that its important, but their hands are tied as no one is allowed to spend money allocated for employee development per year.
7. NO STOCK OPTIONS..!! The company might advertise itself as a having good stock prices, but the employees get nothing. All you get as a new hire package is relocation benefits and a one time pay of amount close to your monthly salary.
8. Company doesn't contribute for socio-economic development in the region. Most other companies have grants or projects setup.

Employees who continue to stay are those who are primarily born and brought up in the Seattle area, they don't stick around because they like the company or anything of that sort.
2 Management has no clue on how to handle employee needs or how to keep the workforce happy. Please be receptive of your employees needs. Appreciating the work done by engineers and doing small things for them to show that you care for their contribution goes a long way.
3. Please focus on research and development type of work, modernizing the infrastructure, hiring new people and building more facilities to make existing products better or innovate new products for the future. Reaping the benefits of the 1970's products isn't going to help the company in the long run.

People who had beards for 30 years had to lose them or fear for their job. Very few execs had the power/guts to not implement the policy. 
This culture of fear can also be seen in technical product shortcomings being swept under the rug. As an executive, why bring something unpleasant up when you could lose your bonus or job? By the time the shortcoming hits sales, you can have a few more years of employment and bonuses. 
What better way to create fear in your executive ranks than to publically dress down a demoted executive in front of employees during a division wide meeting for non performance?

","1. Managers are not held to any ethical standards or protocol. The company does host seminars, classes and courses on how to behave as a PACCAR employee - these are complete lip service, managers are not held to account for their behavior, and are rewarded for results only, if this means degrading, embarrassing and stepping over others to get there - they will, and do. Managers have no accountability in how they get results - period. 
2. IT management has given direction to employees and Project Managers to specifically lie and omit information on projects, for their own personal gain and promotion. On several occasions budget information and project updates were falsified to portray work as being on budget and on time, when they were not. Its all about saving face, and not showing any bad news of any kind. If you do show these types of things, individuals were reassigned, or punished in their reviews as being uncooperative. 
3. Lack of collaboration, IT Managers simply do not like one another. Quite often, their personal distain for one another, gets in the way of professional progress. Public bickering, fighting and trash talking, is commonplace and has completely demoralized the IT staff. 
4. Employees are threatened with physical violence for not delivering work on time. These instances have been ignored by HR and other management staff on multiple occasions because they simply don't want to deal with it. This has made for an incredibly unhealthy work environment in multiple work groups in IT. 
5. Apathy is a perfect descriptor for many who carry the title of Director and above. There is little or no concern for the employees, but complete focus on Level 41 and above completing their ""IC Goals"" at the expense of others goals and objectives. 
6. This is not a technology company - despite multiple claims that the company is a technology company that builds trucks - it a complete falsehood. This company is utilizing technologies that were antiquated in the 1980's. Most of the IT staff here is dedicated to crisis management and no commitment to forward looking technology. 
7. Layoffs are commonplace, even if you are a salaried employee - as an IT worker, you may be asked to go home, and take non-paid days off, so that the company can at least on paper, show that they are profitable. Don't think, just because you are a salaried - even at a high level salary - that you are exempt from this - you are not. 
8. The work force here is on average 48-50 years old, and no investment is being made in securing younger workers. Salaries at PACCAR are well below industry midpoints, and those they have brought in during the past year, were those who could not find a job anywhere else. The quality and caliber of anyone coming here to work is marginal at best. 
9. While it may seem trivial - nobody smiles. Nobody ever laughs, smiles or seems to be having fun here. Its more like working at a Salt Mine than an office environment. There is not a single example I can site, where someone is excited to come to work, and do great things, most employees are simply stuck here because they want their pension, and have no idea how to get out from under their situation. Its just sad.
10. Managers have no tools to help their employees feel valuable. While the company advertises that they will help employees with tuition, training and other methods to further their careers - it takes an act of God to actually get these from the company. Training is impossible to get approved even if there are budget dollars set aside, managers do not use it and end up getting some of this money back in the form of a bonus for not spending it on employees - so the are really incented to keep the money and give it back, versus using it on their employees education. 
11. Project Managers are really administrative assistants. The PMO and Project Managers have no influence in any fashion across the company. IT in particular is bad, where templates have been created and check boxes available for every conceivable task on any project. There is little or no flexibility in how projects are managed - everything is completed from a list developed from PM Methodologies from 1975 and our simply outdated and no longer relevant. 
12. More time is spent scrutinizing punctuation, than on content for just about every possible deliverable. Presentations could be magnificent, with incredible thought given - however, if a single word is capitalized and should not be - the entire presentation will be considered a failure and you will be in your managers office explaining why you misspelled the word. 
13. Turnover is in excess of 60% in most areas - however, they will claim its positive attrition so they don't have to admit there is a retention problem - its unreal to hear how they manipulate the metrics to not make it sound as if this is not a desirable place to work - but denial is a key component to not fixing the problem. 
14. There is no room to base decisions on instinct here - if you don't use Six Sigma to make your decision - its the wrong decision. Never has a company collected more people who cannot think on their own, as here. If you like to shoot from the hip, or want to make a decision based on 30 years of experience, don't try it here. You must use charts, graphs, and math to make any decision whatsoever - or you are wrong - and will be called out on it. The entire place could be run with 8th graders and charts - as they don't leverage the employees experience for anything here - which makes for a very boring experience - especially if you actually know anything. 
15. There is a long list of Chairman'isms which over time have been listed here on Glassdoor such as:
 - Individuals with facial hair being sent home and/or terminated for not shaving (despite the fact this is not a company policy.
 - Even if you accept the fact that the company is conservative and has a dress code - your clothing and the cost of your clothing, is measured by all those around you. If your tie or shoes are not expensive enough - you will be told that they are substandard, and do not meet the fashion standards despite the fact, none of the standards are written down. Its completely subjective and you are at the mercy of people who feel 1980's pinstriped suits, are still in vogue. 
 - Individuals have been terminated for smoking because - only lazy people smoke and we don't need lazy people working here. 
 - Employees are told that they cannot eat in their offices or cubes, because the Chairman finds the smell of food offensive, so you must eat outside, or go out versus trying to bring your lunch or risk being called out in public as offending others.

Although these exemptions were accepted they are currently being reviewed by the PACCAR legal department, leaving great engineers in fear of termination.

The KW division cafe got a remodel after the CEO got mustard on his tie getting salad.
In 2010 the CEO banned employees from using the KW division cafe when senior management meetings were held there.

Most people are over-paid for what they do or what skills they have. It would be a nice place to ride out the last 5 years of your career if you can tolerate the 1970s culture.
","The company uniform is the same dress as Walmart employees. Pay increases used to be every 18 months but have been extended to every 24 months. Pay increases are biased towards seniority rather than performance. Senior employees believe they are entitled to everything because of their 15 to 40 years with the company. There are no consequences for senior employees who take negative action towards the company. There is more effort put into maintaining tradition than to making improvements. They like 6 Sigma but the projects they do contain no real improvements (used for recognition only).
 Absolutely no leadership on any level. Managers ""preside"" over their area of responsibility. They like to move people around so you may end up working for a manager who has no experience in your field/discipline. This company tends to favor employees from purchasing & accounting and those from the corporate office when it comes to promotions.
 Lots of issues around ethics. The mandate by plant management is for employees to falsify plant data so efficiency metrics submitted to corporate meet their goal. Our GM likes to hire his friends/neighbors that due substandard work for the facilities. He also likes to do direct hires of friends/neighbors into positions. 
 The ""Chairman"" really is crazy(reference other postings on employee facial hair). If you approve of the CEO that only means that you have never met or dealt with him.

","Extremely top-down management, a CEO who all employees literally live in fear of (including top management under him), mediocre pay, horrendously old-school policies and culture. For example, this week at Kenworth (where I work, a division of Paccar), a no-facial-hair policy was suddenly enacted- employees with facial hair were told on Wednesday upon arrival at work that they had until 9 am to go home and shave, or not come back (take vacation or leave without pay). Despite people at every level of Kenworth management and HR stating that they knew this would cost them valuable employees and employee morale, they all felt their hands were tied since the decision had come from Mark Piggot due to his personal dislike of facial hair. Many employees were affected by this, including two who were within 2 weeks of retirement after 40+ years with the company. Paccar values money over all else, and finds myriad ways to demonstrate how completely valueless individual employees are to them. You're just a number, and you can be replaced.

I have been working at PACCAR full-time
Pros
There are opportunities to move from job to job and gain experience in different areas. From engineering, to marketing, to sales. If you want to change things up, it's possible. Paccar will also invest in training their employees, so for a young person it's a decent place to start and get some credentials. Tuition reimbursement is ok, but isn't as good as some other businesses in the area: Paccar will pay 1/2 of the tuition for classes that relate to your job. People are generally hard working and reasonably smart. Not too many duds. Also not a horrible place to maintain work/life balance.

Paccar still offers a pension, which is pretty rare these days.
Cons
Now for the bad... The worst thing about working here is the pay scale. It's horribly inconsistent! Some people move up rather quickly, while others slog along and don't receive the compensation they deserve. It's not uncommon for a recent hire of 1-2 years to make more than someone who's been there much longer. The culture that is bred here also promotes keeping one's salary private, so these inconsistencies can go unnoticed by most. They claim to give promotions based on performance, but those who good employees who meet expectations can expect to get salary increases that don't keep up with inflation.

If you are looking to move up the pay scale, expect to work lots of overtime with little/no extra compensation. Supervisors are expected to work long hours.

Extremely conservative culture! Employees are expected to look the part, which means a white shirt and tie for males. Facial hair is severely frowned upon (except the standard mustache). Those who don't conform, don't stand much chance of moving up the ladder.

Benefits: 
If you think your vacation benefits are safe here, think again. Senior management will occasionally mandate that employees take some vacation. One can only assume this is to rid the books of vacation liabilities to meet earnings goals, but it sure sucks to be forced to take vacation that you have been saving. The moral of the story? Paccar will do whatever is required to make money. The bottom line is more important than employee satisfaction. If you work here, expect to get sucker punched from time to time.

Sick leave, paternity leave, and extended sick leave policies are also not as generous as other companies in the area.

Thu Feb 20 2014, Software Engineer,"Renton, WA",Former Employee ,Absolutely Awful Place for an IT Professional,10,"I made some great friends while working there.
","Let's start with pay. One thing that is true for all non-director positions is that the compensation is dismal. The only ones making respectable money are senior management. PACCAR does not have a bonus structure for normal employees. Only senior management gets bonuses, which can be as much as 25% of their [already high] salary, and is based on yearly goals that they set. You know bonus time is near when your director has you drop everything and focus on their goals.

Raises are few and far between. There is a small pay bump every 18 months (or longer) - up to 6% when times are great (rare) and 3% or lower during average times. Getting a decent raise (which HR caps at 10%) is all about how you present yourself to senior management. There is a list of employees ""deserving"" of a raise that senior management goes through every month. They pick and choose a few people to give raises to, and move the others up or down the list. In order to get a raise, most people change teams or threaten to leave the company.

Benefits are OK. There is a 5% 401K match, which is paid yearly so that the company can hold onto your money for as long as possible. A pension exists, but unless you're planning on putting in decades of earning low pay with the company, it's hardly a benefit. Vacation starts at 2 weeks and goes up to 3 after 5 years. Medical benefits are average.

As for the work environment, everyone except for senior managers are in cubicles. Everyone is given the same, outdated Dell machine - even software developers. PC refreshes are few and far between. There was one refresh while I was there and management made a big deal out of it, so don't expect another anytime soon.

The atmosphere is stuffy. Corporate requires every employee to wear a suit. Other divisions require a shirt and tie. The IT division allows jeans and a collared shirt, which we've been warned can change at any time. Whenever somebody ""important"" (ie. the Chairman) visits, formal dress attire is required by all employees.

Good managers are few and far between, and it's even more rare for a manager to have any idea about the work you do. Most managers make it their life's work to impress their superiors, as that is truly the only way to move up. Because of this, don't expect your boss to have your best interests in mind.

Speaking from a software development standpoint, the work is not all that difficult. The hardest part is managing ever-changing requirements, and trying to get your head around the spaghetti code. Because most people (at least developers) leave within two years, the best coders are usually the lowest paid. Those that have been there 5 or more years are typically in it for the ""long haul"". They own a few applications and are content with their position in the company and with their tunnel-vision technical knowledge.

There are a few great developers, but for the most part the company is getting what it pays for. The interviews are ridiculously easy. Management has pressured interview teams to limit (or remove) the technical questions they ask an applicant for a technical position. If you make it through the interview process and receive an offer, make sure you negotiate for now and not the future. HR has lied to numerous employees, telling them that they can expect a raise within six months of being employed.

PACCAR has a lot of trouble attracting developers. Because of this, it recently created the ""PACCAR India Technical Center"", which has been taking on more and more work. Employees are in agreement that the majority of IT work will eventually end up in India.

There is probably a lot more that's wrong with the company that I cannot think of at this time. The moral of this story is: Do not work there.

--Importance is relative & transient. Mostly owing to the Chairman's fickle whims (i.e. the ""Eye of 
Sauron"")

-Mediocre monetary compensation for someone working 40 hrs/week, let alone the actual 50+ expected

-Conservative by every measure. Both in the social format of the workplace and in the willingness to expend resources toward a new idea not guaranteed to contribute to next quarter's profits

-Outsourcing any actual engineering to suppliers (always the lowest bidder and/or currently in favor with Corporate Purchasing) or to India. Quality usually suffers, and engineers morph into project managers forced to ride those doing the work but with little opportunity to build any true expertise on the material. Expertise & responsibility are maligned terms, with the former presupposed on the latter & the latter nebulously defined/allocated.

-Promotion to level of incompetence: Capable and reliable colleagues are rare, as those demonstrating such tendencies are either promoted elsewhere or make the determination that PACCAR is not for him/her. While not true of all, at least 60% of employees have resigned to donning a brain slug along with the tie and rely on apathy as a coping mechanism. Motivation for most is probably best summarized by, ""what is the minimum amount I need to do to have the fewest number of people riding my back to get what they want?""

I worked at PACCAR full-time for more than a year
Pros
A great place to start learning about work ethic and discipline
Professional working environment with high level of peer respect
Depending on your team, managers are very weathered (~30 years at PACCAR) and can get you up to speed in no time.
Cons
Salary is lower than other competition's (sort of a known fact). 
Conservative ol' grandpa mentality - Wear a tie, be quiet, and laugh even when the manager makes a horrible joke.
Don't even try to negotiate for extra PTO. 2 weeks is what you get. Period!

Expectations are low because the Tech Center is not actually responsible for any projects, which results in a good work/life balance
The company has always managed to convince investors that they're making money, so you can be assured your paycheck will always clear
There are a lot of really knowledgeable friendly engineers and a couple of outstanding managers
Great area to live in, and decent team spirit between lower employees because everyone is miserable together and has many of the same complaints
","Tech Center management is never able to say no to crackpot 'innovations' from Daf
Tech Center only exists as data collection hub for Daf, the less technical input you have to the functions the better
Never any opportunity to do things the right way, only the DAF way. As a result PTC ends up being responsible when dead end Daf projects inevitably fail on North American trucks 
Customer always comes last after management plays politics in order to ensure their own bonus checks are maintained by misrepresenting project status and dreaming up positive metrics 
Worker to manager ratio is around 2-to-1
Benchmarking activities exist only to delude senior management as to the superiority of paccar products
Daf continuously removes access to failure reporting systems to ensure their metrics are kept positive, and failures go ignored or unreported
development is pulled from one shiny thing to the next as chairman spots various things on competitor vehicles that paccar doesn't offer (and there are many) - team is then given 1/10 the time required to properly develop the feature
Management team never met a deadline they couldn't shorten to absurdity

Sat Jul 13 2013, Process Improvement Coordinator,"Louisville, KY",Current Employee ,Great place to get your feet wet...,1,"Pros
1. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement and growth for entry level employees. Paccar is very focused on getting the job done with as little expense as possible, therefore, they will often hire internally because they can save 5-$10,000 annually hiring someone who has less experience internally rather than hiring someone externally. This provides a great way for people on the floor to get promoted from within. 
2. Paccar has decent health care benefits and a great 401k company stock match. Your 401k is matched annually with company stock up to 5%. You are fully vested and you can contribute 30 days after you hire in (company match begins 1 year after hire date).
3. PACCAR provides tuition reimbursement @ 50% with no annual limit. This applies to any level (Associates, Bachelors, Masters or Doctorate). They also provide an additional cash bonus for completing an advanced degree, (Masters or Doctorate) although; you can only take advantage of it once.
4. Paccar also has a GREAT relocation package if you can get approved for one. They pretty much take care of everything and provide you with some cash to make the transition easier.
5. There are alot of other little benefits such as cell phone plan discounts, computer purchase programs, software discounts, etc.)
","Cons
1. There is an over emphasis on degreed employees. There is an obvious glass ceiling for employees without Bachelors or Master’s degrees. 
2. Paccar often does not pay salaries that are commensurate with responsibilities. For example, Paccar may pay 40,000 a year for what many other companies are paying 50-55,000.
3. There is an obvious lack of employee development for the non-managerial/executive level. 
4. Paccar often does not reward high performing employees. Often the differences in raises for performance evaluations for those that meet expectation and exceed expectations are minimal or non-existent at best.

","Fixed schedule. The company's culture ensures that any responsible employee would feel guilty going to a doctor appointment or stay home to care for a sick kid. 
No way to work from home. You can say you're working from home, and the reality is that nobody would believe you actually worked. The infrastructure doesn't really support it, and management doesn't encourage it. 
Suit and tie every single day, including Friday. The chairman does watch the dress code closely. Sometimes memos go out in the summer time to remind ladies not to wear certain shoes, and nylons are required. Many more silly rules!

","Many of the cons I read about PACCAR are that is too traditional, the pay is bad and the computers are old. My office is business casual, but I do still wear a tie although many do not. The pay might be below some of the other companies in the Seattle area, but the benefits and stability make up for it in my mind and there is no expectation to work 60 hours a week. The computers are old and slowly being replaced, but I have never worked anywhere with nice computers. The company is frugal, but I think that is a good value as a shareholder.

Best advice ever!
I learned a lot about keeping my resume up to date and arainging interviews whenever I managed to save enough vacation time to take off an go to one. I was much more selective about interviews given the dearth of vacation PACCAR offers it's workers.
","Management seems oblivious to the fact when the market turns down they cut staff and hours, but NEVER project scope nor work load.
In fact if the market turns down management cuts engineering staff, and they accept any order the sales teams can snag, even orders that require 100's of engineering hours to figure out.
Since they layoff all drafting support, engineers end up working 55+ hours a week to meet deadlines.
Deadlines in jeopardy - your manager will harass you till you get that task done, knowing full well the screaming manager will return next week. Manager will move from Engineer to Engineer reminding him the deadlines can't slip. Can you say Office Space TPS report?
Endless ""Recovery"" plans to figure out how to keep the projects on schedule. Plan's always involve ""Free Overtime Engineering"" to do the work mainly because management is oblivious to what it actually takes to design their product.
IC goals given from Mark Pigott to his minions make sure dumb decision are made throughout the year so they can get their IC bonuses.

Having Indian engineers from L&T now KPIT come over on H1B visa's? What the heck is our government doing with today's unemployment allowing drafters in? Like we have NO US workers able to run Pro-E? Are you serious? These Indian drafters are great, but how did PACCAR convince the government they could NOT find a single US drafter to run Pro-E? Why bring these low skilled Pro-E jocks in from Indian? I can see using CAD jocks in INDIA, but to allow them in the US under H1B, just plain wrong?

-The ""process"" that has kept this manufacturing company in business is seen as the ""proper"" way to run the IT department. You just put cog A into slot B. How hard can that be?
-All hiring into the department is done from an outside source. There is NO possibility of internal development or growth. If you want to get ahead, you have a better chance of quitting your current position and immediately applying for that same position with a 10% salary increase.
-Every other job is a dead end and you ""will be much more satisfied if you wait 5 years and see where this job takes you"".
-People are interchangeable parts. There is no sense of skill level or competence, you just pick a person out of the hat and they are the best person for the job.

- Does not seem to care about your personal development, especially if you really want to excel in software construction because all the company wants to do is get by (in terms of quality of systems).

- When you do get a raise it is very little and they don't come often (every 18 months or so).
- Management (even the one you directly report to) does NOT understand IT. The company values quick and hacked together software more then software produced with quality. The IT workforce just does enough to keep the company going on a day to day basis, every IT employee is pretty much doing support and maintenance.
- Too much bureaucracy and politics, hard to get things done.
- No innovation in software or application development. again PACCAR does enough just to get by
- Everything is top-down, culture is dull and not exciting.
- Aging employees.
- Aging hardware (software engineers are developing on PCs and laptops that were built in 2004, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some even older)
- High executives get the red carpet treatment, when they are scheduled to be in your building an email goes out the previous day requiring everyone to be in suit and tie, and a conference room is usually set up with catering and linens for them.
- Rare to even speak to your boss' boss, let alone anyone above them.
- Performance reviews are a joke, management have quotas for the score of reviews, which usually means whatever you do, they will find a way to just give you a 3/5 ""Meets Expectations""
Advice to Management
Get rid of half of IT management and hire some better, more talented software engineers that can develop and implement solutions that are highly maintainable, instead of having hacked together solutions that require tons of support and maintenance time to keep running.

I worked for their parts division and had no fear of layoffs. Their trucks are the best in the industry and senior management is very focused on the company vision.

On the research and development side I was very impressed with the factory and testing facilities. If you are into technology their technology division seems pretty cutting edge. I was also impressed with the way their distribution centers used data to streamline operations. If you can drive a forklift I would say look for employment there.

They are a large company so it is easy to find a niche that you are good at. I found their HR department extremely friendly and competent. I found their benefits so-so but they do provide some tuition reimbursement.

There was support for training classes, especially if you wanted to learn more about the business. They were also supportive of a Toastmaster's group.
","I found the company to be very hierarchical, especially the corporate office and to an extent the Parts division. Senior management seemed aloof and disdainful of the rank and file. The chairman seems to like to rule by fear; and this attitude seems to have trickled down to other senior management.

At the Parts Division, middle management seems more interested in protecting their fiefdoms rather than collaborating with other departments. I have heard another department referred to as ""the enemy"". I also found middle management likely to play favorites. Time off was a mixed card. They seemed pretty flexible but we were also told that they ""owned our weekends"" but most of the time let you have them. There were a few good managers though.

The corporate and parts division seemed to shy away from capital improvements. They would rather throw people at the problem. The technology they used was pretty old; a lot of their core data was stored on old mainframes. Leads would have to develop spreadsheets or Access databases to work with the system.

The Corporate office was VERY strict on dress code. Suits had to be worn at all times, including trips to the Bathroom, and only blue or white shirts were allowed. A friend was disciplined for wearing a red shirt under his suit.

Vacation accrued more slowly than in other companies I have worked for.

I have been working at PACCAR
Pros
Stability, Benefits (tuition reiumbursement, etc), Stock purchase plan. 

If you're just starting out and/or are ineterested in the Transportation industry, this is a good place to work. The PARTS divison specifically has many entry level opportunities across the pricing/marketing/operations spectrums. Also if you're experienced and seeking stability, flexible hours (warning: not days), solid benefits, or want to get your MBA from Seattle U or *maybe* UW, PACCAR is a good choice. ITD (tech division) is more laid back and has some scattered charismatic talent. Rumored to be one of the better places to work within PCAR. 

* For aspiring students: PACCAR will pay for education BUT there is a committment after you recieve your degree/certificatation.
Cons
Stagnant/conservative coroporate culture, big & slow to adapt to change, sub-competitive salary, glass ceiling for women. 

The company was created as and remains to this day a family-owned company. Piggot family holds a huge majority of shares and thus the chairman has a heavily vested interest in not screwing up. While this normally isn't a terrible thing, Mark Piggot is no Steve Jobs/Ballmer/Gates/Bezos/Schmidt/Walton/Buffett/etc. Upper management (especially CEO Piggot) is feared rather than respected. This chips away at morale, especially in high profile positions that answer to upper level suits. The silver lining is that for most entry/base level employees, exposure to these people is limited so if you're not particularly bothered by the culture of discontent, you can work blissfully unaware in your 1970's style cube. 

Another point of contention amongst employees is compensation. While HR claims to be ""competitive"", most people leaving the company generally receive 15-25% raises for similar jobs at competitors (Freightliner, Navistar, Boeing). While young, this might not seem a terrible loss considering that you have time to learn & build your resume. However, for middle-old ppl this could present a problem as you could find yourself paid less for work thats worth more. However, executive pay is higher than average (reportedly...still attempting to confirm this) so if you're experienced at the top levels, PCAR might be a good choice. 

Last topic: Old. Yes thats right, Paccar is old. Old school, old fashioned, old values, old people, even old cubicles. If you're thinking you'd like to work from home, think again. (some exceptions). If you'd like to work 4X10hrs, look elsewhere. Wear jeans to work? Nope. Access your Hotmail/Gmail/Comcast email acct. from work? Not a chance. YOUTUBE? Nope. All we do here is good honest work :-) Even the continuous improvement ideaology is old (Six Sigma). There are also alot of ""old"" employees, many of whom are ""life-ers"" who can't command equivalent salaries elsewhere because they lack a college degree, regardless of acheivements or intelligence. So if you're not so into ""OLD"", you might be better off seeking ""new"" pastures elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Out with the ""OLD"" and in with some new, please. 

PACCAR undoubtedly has some market strength and durability but as the company continues to expand overseas, we will need to change our outward & inward strategies. While quick to exploit market opportunities, we're woefully negligent of internal issues. Modernizing our workspaces/tools, attitudes and culture would pay enormous DIVIDENDS - just what we like here at PACCAR (NYSE:PCAR).

","Not a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves. In over two years I never met a single (openly) gay colleague. People are very cautious about what they say within these walls.

Self-destructive, cold-blooded (or paranoid?): I saw this company fire two good/loyal engineers for utterly ridiculous reasons in 2010.

I remember management once ""requiring"" my entire dev team (group of 40ish design engineers) to work 50 hour weeks for a special ""push"" with no extra compensation other than free soda. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.
Advice to Management
Improve morale with:
1) Regular pay raises that do 'more' than break even with inflation. 
2) Casual work environment. There's no reason engineers should have to wear slacks every day. They are not selling products.
3) Less restrictive internet. Show some trust in your employees and allow gmail, etc...
4) More flexible working hours, and don't 'stink-eye' employees who prefer to come later in the morning.
5) If you want to require teams to work overtime, you better pay for it.

I have moved on to a much more progressive company, and am much more happy.

Expectations are high of everyone and that does include those at the top. When given responsibility for something, you are expected to deliver business results; not excuses. Budget and people are not the only way to drive success. You need to be creative and innovative too. This combined with a positive and supportive attitude will open doors for new opportunities. Executive management emphasizes ethical and professional business practices. If you are up to the challenge, this is one great company to work for.
