Advice to Management
Start to value your employees and reward them for their successes. Today, you allow great and experienced employees to walk out the door, and you reward newcomers a lot more than you would have had to the existing employee; this is a recipe for poor ROI.

Advice to Management
Managers and directors do what they can to keep everything afloat. Senior management has no grasp on how much un necessary work is done for simple tasks. Direction is constantly changing and no one knows what is going on. Company is very reactive. This company is a decade behind competitors when it comes to company data. Most data is wrong and everyone spends hours fumbling around spreadsheets to manipulate data. If you are freesh out school and want to spend 50 hours a week playing in excel then this would be the job for you.
Anyone that is ever promoted will be expected to work their new position and their old position until a replacement is hired. There is a high workload for every employee and when a team member leaves or is promoted the remaining team members suffer.

","Don't expect them to acknowledge your schooling or years of experience. No one below corporate makes any decisions. Bureaucratic nonsense from know it all, micromanaging executives who can't trust the managers THEY HIRED, infest this place. It is a cesspit of constant negativity, ignorance, stupidity, and the most detached and out of touch, wishy washy, helter-skelter leadership I have seen at any place I have ever worked.

They like to talk a big game about investing in your future and helping you develop professionally. Forget it. Quarterly and annual reviews are a complete joke and a waste of time. You get an email notifying you one is coming up and you may never even have it conducted. Even when a review actually happens, it isn't anything like the emails sent out where they encourage you to come up with talking points to ask your manager for feedback on or talk about your goals and how to meet them. What actually happens is you sit down and go ""uh huh, uh huh."" All the goals are written down for you and you literally copy and paste the goals you are told to input. If you don't work for them in a corporate office environment and do anything else for them, don't expect anything to go as they say it goes. It doesn't. 

 If you have alligator skin, solid work ethic, a good sense of humor, and are really needing that stable paycheck, welcome aboard!

Impossible to give advice to management, because HW changes managers faster than I change underwear. Managers don't want to stick around because they are subject to micromanaging clueless executives who cling to ineffective anti scientific approaches and bully them. So the advice to the executives? Sell the industry to a company who cares. We all know you could really use the cash to buy a second yacht and a third chateau.

","I specifically worked at Honeywell UOP, based in Des Plaines, IL as part of their Career Development Program. Management and business groups were constantly changing. I never felt secure in my place at the company. They were quite unforgiving in their layoffs, choosing new hires, employees of over 10+ years, and college hires that had yet to even start (they rescinded their job offers after multiple delays). Main headquarters in Des Plaines was outdated and felt like I traveled back in a time machine to the 80's or 90's.

Thu Dec 10 2020, Senior Engineer,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Shaping the Future...on a tight budget,4,"Honeywell middle management is generally flexible, forward thinking, and generally wants to be there / make a difference in their workplace. Honeywell has generally supported grassroots employee resource groups, such as networks for Women in Tech, LGBT, Veterans, Black, Latinx, etc. Growth areas of the company are generally rewarding to be a part of, and there are frequent opportunities for people to work on interesting technology.
","Honeywell, at the high levels, employs a hardball culture, and expects to win every short-term negotiation it participates in, whether it is with customers, suppliers, or employees. Stock price and working capital are king, and this guides most short and long term decisions in the company. Expect the quality of your benefits to decline every year, either in monetary value or flexibility. For example, raises were awarded, frozen, and then taken away in 2020. During benefits enrollment, they advertised no increase in premiums...for those who did not see a salary increase. For those who did, they were tagged with a 40% increase. Honeywell had recently increased the company match from 6% or 7%, but revised it to providing in a lump sum at the end of the year, offsetting any annual compounding they would have received.

Thank you for sharing a review! We’re glad you’ve recognized our employee networks and access to technology in your comments, and hope these in particular have enriched your employee experience. We also appreciate your candid comments about our benefits offerings. Our US benefits team budgets annually for the increases in inflation and the cost for participants with serious health risks, and they recently communicated that there will be no premium increases or plan design changes for 2021 US plans. There are also different contribution tiers depending on salary. If an employee’s salary were to change beyond the contribution tier’s threshold, the level of contribution would be aligned to the new tier. As Glassdoor is anonymous, we are unable to address your specific concern, but encourage any employee with questions about benefits contributions to speak with their HR Generalist",,4.0,,,,,,,,

I don't think enough is provided in care to employees. It is demoralizing to have to constantly see almost no raises or ones that don't even keep up with inflation.

When I tried to negotiate my salary I was told that they were ""surprised"". Salary negotiation is an important part of any job offer acceptance process and even if the offer is firm (they cannot offer any money), it made me feel as though I was acting unprofessional/ungrateful in asking for a higher salary. This is a normal part of the job process and HR should not make candidates feel as though they are out of line in trying to make sure they receive a fair salary. I was happy with the initial salary they offered, however stated certain reasons why I believed I should earn more. In the end, they told me they could not offer any more, and I accepted the job because I was very interested in the position/company/location, however it rubbed me the wrong way that I was made to feel out of line in attempting to negotiate.

Mon Nov 02 2020, Software Engineer III,,Former Employee ,Corporate Mismanagment Prime Example,1,"They will pay you a wage that is good for someone fresh out of college. This is great for people that are actually fresh out of college.
","- Hiring and promotions based on relationships and not skills.
- Stagnant pay. Expect 1-3% raise per year, at most. Had several years with 0% raise as well as several furloughs during my time working there, effectively lowering my pay. Aside from promotions (which were very rare), my pay barely kept up with inflation. All the while the company was still increasing profits and giving huge salaries to the ever-expanding upper management.
 - CONSTANT management/corporate shake-ups and changes in the reporting structure. So much so that often times I had no idea who my manager was a couple levels up without going and investigating the org chart.
 - While I was there, our group was moved within the company reporting structure no less than 4 times. Between myself and the CEO were at least 9 managers. It seemed like there was nearly 1 manager for every 2 employees.
 - Management created and constantly pushed initiatives that would stifle our ability to work. We couldn't just make a product without spending 8 months reviewing, discussing, and making changes to appease all 9 of the managers for the product. Frequently, a manager wouldn't pay attention to the product until it was well within development, and would then start pushing changes.
 - The things we did make were not thought out to a reasonable degree. Marketing would hear from a single customer a feature or product they'd like. Marketing would push this to engineering and we'd go through months of planning and development. Input from actual engineers saying that the thing they want is impractical, or useful only to that specific customer would be ignored. When we finally get a product out, nobody would buy it.
 - Strong push to move as much to India as possible. I loved the team from India that I worked with and I am still friends with some of them. But the company seems to want to push all major development there even when it doesn't make sense. Management also seemed to try to ""hide"" how many of the projects were being sent to India. There were several instances where we would find out that a team in India was working on a new project that integrates with something we created/maintain, or were working on copies of products that we made. We'd discover this because one of their engineers would get stuck and email us asking for help on something we created; we'd find out they're 6 months into, and struggling with, developing a product that we likely could've made ourselves in 2 months or that we could have at least shared some initial knowledge about to speed up the project for the other team. I believe this was the case because there was different reporting structures for the US and IN teams, and there were people in upper management that could make themselves look good by throwing a ton of projects over the wall to IN and then showing off how much work they got done, regardless of marketability, profitability, or quality of the products that were made. I do not blame the IN engineers for this, it was purely bad management and the IN teams absolutely could've been utilized in better ways.
Advice to Management
- Reduce management size - there are so many managers that they're forced to come up with initiatives that ultimately get in the way of product development.
 - Reduce number of processes - engineers can get more done when they're allowed to focus on work.
 - Value your employees instead of seeing how little you can give them and still keep them there. The minimum to zero yearly raises is painful.
 - If you want to be the ""Apple of the Industrial world"", pay your engineers an appropriate salary. You can't attract or keep high-performing engineers while paying them a fraction of what they'd get at other software companies. High-performing job seekers will not look at you as an option. The high-performing engineers that you do have will not be motivated to perform at their maximum capacity when they aren't paid like they would be at a modern tech company; they will either under-perform (while still meeting goals) for the sake of the job being ""easy""/""laid-back"", or they will move to one of the companies that will pay them for their ability to go above and beyond the minimum.
 - Take the India teams out of the silo and actively integrate them with the US teams.

Fri Oct 16 2020, Aerospace,"Phoenix, AZ",Former Employee ,"Do Not Work Here,",2,"Paycheck when not on furlough
","Worst place I ever worked. Good people, horrible Leadership and leadership culture. 9 reductions in force in 4 years. In between RIFs you get unpaid furloughs. They will do anything to meet op income. No effort toward any other metrics. No vision beyond the end of the week or end of the month. An aerospace company that does not invest in manufacturing, quality or improving their horrible products. Every year, 8 to 10% of employees are put in the “lower elbow”, meaning no pay increase and no bonus. They say no quotas, but if a plan was submitted with less than 8%, it would get rejected until more people are assessed as “below standard”. Products development is horrible. Not validated beyond sample of 1 or 2, and they keep on pushing junk out the door. These are aerospace products for goodness sake. Makes me afraid to fly! They say they value employees because it’s the politically correct thing to do. They do not walk the talk. Not possible to have any less respect for your employees. DO NOT WORK HERE !
Advice to Management
You are the worst. There is more to running a long term, sustainable business than the end of the month or end of the quarter revenue. Chasing parts every day is not a strategy. You have no sense of how to truly build a team. Fear of an “outer elbow” and daily verbal abuse does not build a winning team. Be aware, most people only stay because it’s the job they have and would leave in an instant if they could replace their pay and not have to move. Turn on employee surveys that you stopped if you want to know the truth. You’ve demonstrated you do not care. Exit. Bring in someone who knows how to drive a long term business.

Fairly flexible schedule as long as you're getting the job done
Very approachable senior management
The sensation that they care about the employees
Employees will complain about the benefits but in reality they're not bad
","Honeywell is not on a hiring surge, they are quietly on a layoff surge. 50 this week, 50 more 2 weeks from now. Major attempt to keep it out of the public eye for fear it hits their stock price. Some is COVID related but there are big pockets where people are being told that their job is being off-shored or that if they want to maintain their employment they have to move. This is especially true in marketing and development.

Senior leadership has a desire to announce products WAY before they are market ready. ""Just get it out there and fix it later."" You get left dealing with very unhappy customers whose complaints fall on deft ears.

Very little vision within the rank and file. Blue and red is great but red and blue is confusing and whatever you do, don't bring up green!

Newer employees tend to be laid off first. Longer term employees can have zero value but they'll hang onto them and even promote them. Having worked for several Fortune 50 companies, this place exceeds the typical bureaucracy to a fault.

No new ideas unless they are from above and then they're spectacular...NOT

Development is slow, VERY expensive, poor quality and they do not listen to marketing. The Test organization is laughable, there is no interop testing between hardware and software solutions and they've approved release of products with known problems that would take months to resolve...but they hit their date!

Reduction in bonus percentages which has been significant over the past 5 years. You're grandfathered in as long as you do not change business unit. When that happens, you drop to the lower levels.

Pay at below market levels

You will find if you throw out all of the older experienced workers that no one is left who understands the systems or how to build things (yes, you want to be a software company but you are still reading data from hardware). Pair up your older workers with new team members and teach them both new skills for the digital age. Older workers are more reliable, spend more hours on the job, and are very loyal until you let them go.

Sat Aug 29 2020, Project Engineer,"Des Plaines, IL",Current Employee ,Culture has changed,1,"Honeywell UOP was a great place to work with an amazing culture however that has all changed by the upper management/ELT actions or lack of actions. Communication is a major issue within the organization. There use to be a culture of learning and building together to provide our customer with the best service and equipment. That mindset is gone, it all lip service now. We are not even given the tools to do our job (takes a director to approve a request to replace a broken headset) and lack of basic support structure (onboarding, IT, admins).
","This year has been difficult for all. We went from hiring multiple people to 3 RIF, 3 weeks of furloughs, no pay increases, and early retirement packages. There is no communication from upper management which creates uncertainty and anxiety within the project teams. Projects are forced to use purchase services to complete tasks which leads to quality issues and delays. Upper management/ELT seems completely unaware of how their actions or lack of actions are perceived by the lower ranks

Communication is key during these difficult time to ensure your employees stay engaged and motived.
