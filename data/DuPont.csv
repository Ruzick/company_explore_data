Please consider across the board cuts as an alternative to layoffs during difficult times. Also, please consider refraining from costly stock buybacks when times are good. Instead, use the excess cash to retire debt and build healthy reserves. So the company is better able to ride out turbulent times without disruptive reorganizations.

- Friendly atmosphere with colleagues all across the world
- Diversified high performance materials portfolio
- Room for advancement
- Very thoughtful package if you are laid off like I unfortunately was
Cons
- Focused on short term gains for shareholders, not long term strategy for employees
- Minimal reward and recognition for high performers
- Little to no action taken to remove low performers
- Fewer options to move and develop experience laterally across the company as business units have shrunk and been sold off
- R&D has been essentially killed off. Don't expect any major breakthrough inventions anymore. Company is focused on innovating with existing products and growing through M&A
Advice to Management
Keep working on buying low and selling high through M&A to bring DuPont back up to its once famous namesake. The 2017-2018 years were booming - try that again! While you're working on getting there, don't forget about rewarding the employees that are working hard to run and maintain the portfolio of aging assets. Once the company is large enough again, bring back that strong R&D center that accelerated growth for so many decades.

","Too many bosses, but too little work. Some managers only have 2-3 direct reports (we need more workers, not bosses. It is not acceptable for a company of this size to have managers with so few reports and these managers do nothing but take credits from their direct reports). With frequent restructuring I had a new boss every 18-24 months. Managers don't know what they are doing, they play the favorite and some people survive without doing anything, whereas people who work hard are not rewarded. If people a few ranks above the managers abuse you, they remained quiet (simply don't care about you) and only care about their progression. 

Promotional opportunities are scare and due to the company dissolving, it is hard to move to other parts of the company without taking a lot of risks.

Job stability is non-existent. Management cannot be trusted; some people who they don't like were simply fired for no reason. With certain people not liking each others, I have seen some people were sent to HR for their bad behaviors. Little professionalism/respect is shown to less senior employees. Too much politics make work slow and nothing could get done easily.

Some people are elitist and still think DuPont is still the best, but you have to keep in mind that the best days of the company were long gone. The company is shrinking month by month, and eventually it would be the end of this 200-year-old company.

They are also going to sell this division (Clean Technologies) to others, so many more layoffs are coming. Once I got a better job, I was advised by certain senior people to take it.

","Constant state of dismantlement; ridiculously overcommitted to social justice/diversity/inclusion initiatives at the expense of hiring competent talent. The Dow-DuPont ""neither-of-us-have-an-innovative-ideas, so-let's ""merge and synergize (i.e., fire a bunch of people)"" merger, was Ed Breen's ""brain-child."" This mis-guided vision for mediocrity resulted in mass layoffs and a three-way spin into: Dow, Corteva, and Remainco (DuPont). Thanks to Ed Breen, the three companies are now worth far less today than they were as either the merged ""DowDuPont"" and the pre-merged ""Heritage Dow"" and ""Heritage DuPont"". After the spin-offs, Breen installed veteran stooge DuPont executive Marc Doyle to absorb some of the predictable ""heat"" that resulted from such gross miss-management. Doyle was sacked after 8 months and Breen was re-instated to ""save"" DuPont. Both Breen and Doyle over-invested in diversity and inclusion and ""social justice"" initiatives at the expense of profits and, frankly, anything resempling a cogent business model bound by common sense. So now, it's a great place to be LGBQT+ unless you like job security. Nice going Ed!

Thu Jan 30 2020, Marketing,,Current Employee ,Current company review,6,"The pros for working at DuPont:
- High ethics among employees
- Passion for creating products that help protect people and make their lives better
- Long history of innovation
- Great co-workers
","The Cons of working at DuPont
- Recent merger with Dow and subsequent split into 3 companies leaves individual companies that are smaller than they were before ... leading to fewer opportunities for advancement
- Very flat organization ... ability to be promoted within current job roles exists, but new jobs at higher levels are slower to be available due to flat organization and the fact that many employees have been at the company 20 years or more and aren't leaving until retirement ... thus not opening up as many opportunities for promotion
- Some jobs do not have well defined career paths
- Salary and bonuses are lagging comparable jobs at other companies
Advice to Management
You have a large group of employees who have only worked at DuPont and those with 20 plus years of service are likely in the pension plan and will probably stay until retirement. For newer employees, there isn't as much incentive to stay at DuPont for longer periods of time ... especially without career growth opportunities and well defined career paths. If you are going to make the new DuPont work, you need to show newer employees that they have a reason to stay.

","Low expectations (demotivator for anyone who seeks to excel at work), mediocre salary and benefits (tries to be slightly above the median), when we merged with DOW we found out that DOW people made 15% more than DuPont people across the board. Bullet proof bureaucracy. Supervisors run programs to support the alternative facts they have been fabricating not reality. Managers seem to encourage rather than discourage that.

Safety used to be a passion, now it has been relegated to liability management.
Advice to Management
Get real: manage for actual growth vs. fictitious narratives. Don't perpetuate zombie programs for years. Change the focus from competence (mediocrity) to excellence--and reward people who excel. There used to be one day a year set aside for excellence awards, 364 days a year to focus on competence. But the cost of excellence seems to have bee too high, now you are back to 365 of mediocrity a year. If you don't see the problem with that, I don't know what other advice I can offer.

I worked at DuPont for more than a year
Pros
Pay and benefits were great and individual employees were very nice and helpful.
Cons
It is “too big”. Personalisation is gone. If I heard, “It’s not the DuPont way” one more time...gag. Being in HR I should be there for the people, but we weren’t-we were there to sustain their systems and processes. Very impersonal and inefficient.
Advice to Management
You’re middle managers from site to region (that I met) are not representing strategic thinking or company perpetuation. They are rehearsed in corporate speak and self preservation. Asking “real” questions and describing challenging barriers was highly discouraged at too many points in the organisation. I don’t imagine it’s the same at the most senior levels-based on the language used by senior leaders. There is a big dysfunctional gap.

Hold yourselves to the same standards. 'Merit' increases are for individual 'merits', while the bonus is for company performance. When you cut the merit increase but keep a bonus (the merit increase is important to most than the bonus) you send your employees the message you only care about yourselves.

To make things worse, the merger with Dow has led to more cutting costs (unnecessary) and more work for already overly stressed workers, and has caused our best workers to move on to better jobs. This has lead to the deterioration of morale, and less productive workforce. Dupont loves to throw around how great it's core values are, and expects everyone to follow them, yet treats their employees with very little respect. Management only cares about making as much money as possible, which leads to short sighted judgement that ultimately is hurting the company, and get this, make less money.

BBAP (Before Breen And Peltz), the company was one of the best places to be, somewhat depending on the business unit you were in, but overall pretty darned good and interesting. DuPont made so many things that changed our country for the better, and many weren't products with short-term return on investment in mind, let alone any profitability for years. Imagine: it took nearly a decade for Kevlar to turn any profit, and it was minimal at best. The value of it was obvious to DuPont scientists, but to bean counters, quarterly-earnings greedsters, and MBA's? Our military and police officers would still be wearing midieval plate armor and chainmail, if not for the cost of steel.
","Murky future at best — for both MergeCo and SplitCo. Rotten outlook for employees, unless you can make it to full retirement in a couple short years. Who knows what will happen to the DuPont of old, in what remaining piece the name will continue, if at all. I hope not; it would be blasphemous given the complete evisceration of R&D, but the marketing wonks still want the ""name value"".

There is no advice on earth that ""current management"" would listen to. They only listen to greed-street activists now, not base employees, so what's the point? DuPont survived two centuries of American progress and downturns, only to be knifed in the back by cowards and left to bleed out. DuPont was still a *family* corporation, not only because generations of parents and their children worked here, but right up to the previous management regime, they still had a shred of the notion that companies exist to employ people, do or make good or great things, and add just a little to that ""pursuit of happiness"" thing in the Declaration.

But if I could send them a tweet, I'd only say ""Thanks for destroying yet another American icon for short-term profit. I hope you get back in spades all you just handed out.""

The biggest con for DuPont is that they are hemorrhaging employees in advance of a merger with Dow Chemical. There is no real future in DuPont for a new employee. DuPont was once the top employer for scientists, engineers, and the like, but that has eroded over the last two decades, and now is utterly gone as the company is exiting basic research, and cutting back on applied research.

Salary is OK. At onetime it was a corporate goal to pay in the top 10% of comparable companies, but now they shoot for above the bottom 25%. I see federal job postings for similar positions that pay far more. Benefits are OK, but shrinking.

I have been working at DuPont full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Steady paycheck, plenty of opportunities to work on interesting projects, working conditions are generally OK, interaction with plant locations around the world; working here still looks good on a resume.
Cons
Professional progression is slow (averaging 12-15 years between mid-career promotions for good performers), and professional training/development is rarely supported if it involves overseas travel. Internal accounting prevents collaboration between groups. Purchasing anything takes several weeks to place the order and often requires follow-up with people located in India. Internet is frequently very slow at the main R&D site (5 minutes to download a 1 Mb journal article). Many of the facilities are in poor condition. Employee morale was low even before the latest lay-off (the largest in 30 years) or the announced plan to merge with Dow and then split into 3 companies.

I have been working at DuPont full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Fairly compensates employees via salary. 401K with 3% given and up to 6% match. Ethical and safety conscious company. Health benefits are average. Professional and intelligent work group.
Cons
Frequent downsizing efforts. Despite being a science company, they lack investment in IT across businesses. Very risk adverse sometimes to the detriment of being decisive when needed. Aging work population and slow to hire and retain and turnover business knowledge to younger recruits.

We all have our complaints, but the reality is that people strive to be able to work here and don't want to leave. Maybe that says something. The value in DuPont was largely created a long time ago with the big discoveries in chemistry following WWII. These products and businesses have been sustaining the company since. Compensation is generally higher than the average. Many of the aspects of the culture can be difficult to take, but in the end provides for a respectful workplace. Colleagues are some of the brightest people you will ever know.
","DuPont is poorly managed. Most managers spend their time managing their careers and not their areas of responsibility. The culture is so hierarchical that decision making grinds to a halt and management often avoids making decisions entirely. Despite attempts to change how the company operates, many people still maintain a silo mentality about their jobs.

I have been working at DuPont full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Great 401k plan (9% company contribution -- 3% for free, plus dollar-for-dollar match up to 6%). Good resources for employees to perform their jobs (computing and experimental equipment). Good co-workers for the most part.
Cons
Corporation preaches work/life balance, but real advancement appears to go only to the workaholics (60 hours per week minimum). Far too much political nonsense. Rampant inefficiency associated with having a centralized engineering organization that business units must pay to use (in the same way that they would pay an external consulting contractor). Business managers are forced to be short-sighted and to weight the initial investment cost of R&D far more than the potential increases in revenue (this is a top-down mandate, starting with senior management and unrealistic profit objectives). ""Old-boys"" relationships make it very difficult for new hires to build client bases without stepping on toes of longer-tenured co-workers. Hearing your manager say ""You're doing all the right things, but I can't promote you because HR will tell me you haven't been at your current level long enough."" As a rank-and-file employee, it's extremely difficult to move the needle in a way that will get you noticed.

Respect for people is non-existent. 401k, vested retirement and flexible hours is about the only thing that's holding other employees from leaving the company.
","The merger with Dow has completely erased all the greatness in those that strived to make DuPont a great company. I even witnessed those that volunteered to improve morale were laid off after having improving site morale. Top notch employees that had been faithful to the company and brought millions in new businesses opportunities were also let go. There is no more a sense of belonging to a great company that once was. R&D and decades of knowledge is being thrown away and more work has been put on those who have survived the layoffs.
Advice to Management
Retain those employees that were making a difference in the company and that had always gone the extra mile to retain a customer and grow the company. Your strongest assets are your employees and their abilities to serve, grow and retain great customer relationships. Stop with the spirit surveys if you're not going to make any positive changes. Or not, don't listen to any advice and own up to your failures. Obviously, the choice is yours.

Pros
DuPont, to date, has great employees, a friendly environment, and has provided a lot of opportunity to move within and across businesses.
Cons
Because of poor results and the ongoing focus on investors and the short-term, employees have been forgotten and have been facing the threat of downsizing for the past decade. The imminent merger with Dow will only continue raising the stress level.

If you get a nice supervisor he or she will be pleasant to work for, respect your family life and be fair about working close to 40 hours/work life balance. If you get a mentally and emotionally stable lab/office mate this will also make your experience a good one.
","The bad and the ugly... notice all of the ifs in the above list? Well that is where the bad cones in. Some managers adopt pet employees and favor them over their non-pet colleagues. 
There is a chance that you will either work for and/or work with a mentally and/or emotionally unstable supervisor or colleague. If your supervisor is a mean, bullying, micromanaging and verbally abusive individual, they will get away with it. Much like society at large does not give mentally unstable people help, DuPont does not give people the help they need or discipline whatsoever the work place bully. Unfortunately if you come into DuPont as an outsider you will not know much about who you are working for and/or with until it's too late.
The psychotic individuals who work at DuPont also seem to be shot callers. They get people to fear them to avoid confrontation and cater to them. Sad to say that I have witnessed this and experienced this on one than more occasion. The best you can hope for us reassignment to someone else who is not a....hymmm.... how do I put it? A kook?
 DuPont sites also leave you hanging on inclement weather late starts and closings. They preach safety as a core value but are very slow to shut the site down when the weather is lousy. This really sucks.
The other knock on this place is the way that managers and supervisors treat the non-PhD workers. It is also very stratified in terms of uber doctors vs. the non-PhD untermenschen.
A few years back they fired a bunch of older workers and replaced them with younger, cheaper labor. It made people wonder if this would happen to them.
Advice to Management
Respect for people should include respect for all people. Meaning if you have supervisors or coworkers who yelling at and disrespecting people, deal with them! 
Also people have personal reasons why they didn't pursue a PhD. Don't encourage such a stratified culture where non-PhD's are looked down upon.Instead recognize individuals on their merit! You can bring in these post-docs who lack business acumen. I also hope that you are not making a business practice of axing older, higher paid workers for younger, cheaper labor.

Also people have personal reasons why they didn't pursue a PhD. Don't encourage such a stratified culture where non-PhD's are looked down upon.Instead recognize individuals on their merit! You can bring in these post-docs who lack business acumen. I also hope that you are not making a business practice of axing older, higher paid workers for younger, cheaper labor.

Wed Sep 16 2015, Process Engineer,"Overland Park, KS",Former Employee ,Great Place for New Grads and New Dads,1,"Great work environment for fathers with young kids and average or below-average work performance/engineering skills. Several of the male managers and experienced male engineers were focused on the family and took advantage of the family-friendly culture. This included babysitting their young kids in their offices during school vacations (even when they had stay-at-home spouses), paternity leave back-to-back with their vacation after birth of a new baby and fathers working from home when kid-related commitments came up and fathers being allowed to work from home on a regular basis after the birth of a new baby.

Colleagues and management will invest a lot of time and training on poor performing engineers who are full-time. The most experienced engineers will train the poor performer and the manager will divert resources to rework unacceptable deliverables. Eventually, the engineer will start producing average work that meets minimum requirements.

Engineers take time to get to know each other outside of work and will become personal friends. For example, engineers had a spontaneous, informal dog meetup in the office and bonded through their animals in the middle of the work day. One of the support staff does dog rescue and puppysits the fosters she adopted out to colleagues while they are traveling.
","An extreme maldistribution of workload between technologies (STRATCO alkylation and IsoTherming hydroprocessing) and strong performers vs poor performers. Engineers do not help each other and will socialize instead of working (even when they have agreed with their manager beforehand to help out).

Potential for extremely long hours per week (80+ and past midnight) for top performers with a unique skill that no one else at the local office possesses. Resources are limited and other business units/locations will not easily make themselves available due to job instability at their sites from massive restructuring. If you don't have young kids, plan to travel in place of colleagues with young kids or on longer trips/farther locations. If you are the only resource that can perform a certain task overseas, plan to travel for several weeks at a time - young kids or not.

Corporate has taken away some of the perks, such as the ability to keep credit card mileage points and airline miles. This would have offset the pay, which is at least 10% lower than common to the oil refining industry. This was okay when the company had stable employment.

","The recent activist investor battle is killing the company. Cost cutting layoffs and instability are causing people to quit left and right.
