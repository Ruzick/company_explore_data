","The quality of managers or team leads vary here. You would be lucky to land with a great group of people, but unfortunately I landed with someone who just doesn’t fit the role of manager or team lead. This particular individual created a toxic work environment, failed to follow the company’s code of ethics, and is not cognizant of those around her nor the best interests of the company. HR and the managers have not these resolved issues, so it’s a matter of accepting this unprofessional hypocrisy or leaving to a company that actually follows through with its policies and have their employees in mind. 

The company culture is toxic and not exactly the ideal place for quality mentorship or growth. The other positive reviews here read as fake, considering I had interviewed with the majority of employees in this particular branch and most have not said a single positive thing in regards to this company. It’s more like a keep your heads down and receive a paycheck type of environment. 

Training is subpar and some people are overpaid for the skills qualified. Seems like the kind of culture where one just coasts until retirement. 

Technology, as others previously have said, is dated and needs improvement. The very people who invested 10+ years of their lives in this company fell behind on modern tech but still kept their positions while laying off highly skilled workers who were tech savvy.

Though there’s a layoff freeze in 2020, the following years do not look promising as this particular branch has a history of laying off workers and shrinking its workforce since inception. At one point in the company, there was no IT on site which is perilous for clients considering the confidential data being handled. Some employees have shown signs of severe mental illness that has affected the procedures. Instead of addressing the issue, they would sweep it under the rug. This kind of passive aggressive communication is jarring considering the kind of work we do and any miscommunication can and has led to issues regarding client data. 

Be warned of high turnover and overall somber atmosphere, lack of cohesion with teams and between departments. Due to budget restraints, this particular branch does not celebrate the usual milestones and holidays compared to its competitors. It’s quite demoralizing environment to be in. Other locations within BNY Mellon, like India, where most of the US jobs are being outsourced to, seem to enjoy team building events that is sorely lacking in this branch. 

As a first job, I would not recommend this company. 
As an investor, I would not do business with them and would seek elsewhere.

The company did a fairly good job of switching everyone to work from home once COVID19 hit, especially considering that they were at one point in time against the concept of WFH entirely.

 My manager was flexible about work/life balance but it does vary from manager to manager.
","BNY Mellon relies on outdated, cumbersome systems but expects state of the art service and results. 

The culture of the company is toxic, colleagues in departments that rely on your work, or whose work you rely upon have no sense of comradery or interdepartmental professionalism.

Poor training for new employees result in poor performance that is not necessarily their fault. The company mandates that management review a certain percentage of their employees at ""below expectations"" so if you have a small team of say 7 people, you have to give one or two a BE even though they do good work. There are even studies on how this does not foster a positive work environment. 

Pay and benefits are not competitive, especially vacation. Non-exempt new hires start at two weeks whereas other companies of the same size or even smaller in this area start at 4. The employee growth programs (mentoring etc) are a farce instilled to establish the illusion that the company cares for it's employees and to look good in their mission statement to shareholders
Advice to Management
Invest in systems that are designed specifically for the task you're trying to complete within them. You can't expect a platform that was created for sales encounters to have the controls in place to prevent customer impacted or compliance errors and provide data for metrics that a system specifically designed for monetary movement would. 

Stop relying on layoffs to trim the budget down enough to compensate for the overall losses the company is experiencing, you can only blame so much on the economic conditions and it can only appease the shareholders for so long. The root of the problem is that we've lost our edge against the competition, these troubles are from lack of pragmatic technology, incompetent and frightened middle management, little investment in product development and poor employee morale.

","1. Average annual raise of about 1-2 percent after you receive excellent ratings.

2. Investment in technology and tech talent is looked upon as an unwanted expense and the focus is always on lowering costs. Although, there are frequent ""talks"" of investing in people, there actions speak otherwise.

3. Your best perk will always end up being that you get to keep your job.

4. Mediocrity rules : When time comes for bonuses and raises, for the most part both average and high performers are treated equally which makes you think if all that extra work was worth an additional 0.5 percent in raises ? 

5. Frequent layoffs so you never know when you job will be axed.

6. Health benefits keep getting worse each year with higher deductibles and higher costs per paycheck. 

7. Promotions are mostly non existent or very hard to come by.

Investment management side of business is in a gradual downward trajectory. The only way left to boost profits (and thus shareholder value) is by reducing expenses further and further. This constant expense reduction mania (which i have now seen for a decade) keeps getting worse and simply does not create a healthy work environment.

Why waste your talents here when there are far better employers out there looking for talented workers like you ?

Take action on the problem employees...better yet, pay attention to the people on the managemnt team that are continually letting bad employees slide.

Instead we get generic emails telling everyone that this thing or that thing needs to improve, when in reality most of the team doing what they are supposed to be doing. The environment makes the pay not worth it.

Advice to Management
Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Hire managers that have experience literally managing teams and understand people. Hire people who know how to set realistic due dates for clients so we don't have to miss every deadline. Give people opportunities to advance and get promoted -- hiring your buddies from your previous job just de-motivates existing staff and confirms that internal people have no shot.

(2) Being a large organization, it ends up running like a factory where you do one thing only. I knew many people that had spent 10+ years doing one function. If you're hungry and have career aspirations, you'll find yourself very frustrated. Also forget about applying internally to jobs. No help there. 

(3) Salaries.. All I'll say is that in the 2+ years since I've left, my salary has doubled. Average annual increases were 1-2%. Since I was in the ""exceeds expectations"" bucket, it was 2-3%. My first year at my new firm, it was 9%.

I support the force ranking system, if it’s fair, for a limited time period, otherwise this boat will sink. I support it primarily because I think there’s a lot of dead weight.

Define what isn’t define due to limited resources, but define nonetheless. Assign proper swim lanes for each department. After force ranking, introduce a 360 performance review approach. Hold people accountable, this should be for everyone. Success is inevitable afterwards. 

It doesn’t feel good to be told your bonus won’t be great when you’ve given more than 100% during the year leading up to it.

","BNY Mellon was a wonderful place to work when I joined the company in 2016. Once Charlie began his reign, everything went downhill. Between layoffs and hiring freezes, my department lost numerous employees without the ability to replace them. Employees were working long hours to compensate for the reduction in workforce and management did not care. There were no promotions because of cost cutting. Some promotions were deemed ""merited"" by management, but not possible because of funds. There is no opportunity to advance within the company. Once you are in one department you are relegated to it forever with few exceptions. With a 1% or 2% raises each year there isn't much incentive to stay. Oh and the fact that the bonus pull for eligible employees dwindles year after year...
Advice to Management
You can only tell employees that they're being given ""opportunities"" so many times without rewarding them with a promotion (especially if they're consistently getting exceeds expectations at performance review time). You're going to lose people this way. It's going to decrease the morale of individuals in your department. 

If employees tell you that they're burnt out, don't ignore it. If they have the courage to say they're burnt out, it's probably for a reason.

Try to redefine what work-life balance means as a company. I was once told that work life balance meant working 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM and then going home to put your kids to bed, only to work another 3-4 hours a night. If you're working those type of hours, you might as well go into consulting where at least you'll be compensated appropriately. 

The types of employees that have been laid off are often crucial to regulatory compliance. It's hypocritical to say you value regulatory compliance when you're constantly cutting those departments (often unnecessarily).

-Disjointed communications between managers and groups leading to constant conflict and animosity. 
-Mandatory ""bottom 10%"" employee rating system - regardless of how long employee had been aboard or size of group.
-Very poor CISO - somewhat technically proficient but a poor leader.
Advice to Management
A complete overhaul is in order with a focus on mid to upper cybersecurity related management, to include holding accountable and releasing management that is not effective or where their group has high turn-over rates.

When there are issues with one or two individuals, there is an employee related problem. When there are issues with several or more employees within the same group, there is a leadership problem - that is the case at BNYM.

At BNYM, there are very few leaders and the focus is heavy on ""managers"". Many of those managers ""rule"" via fear mongering to include outright badgering, yelling, screaming and a host of other unprofessional acts, to include personal insults that could or should lead to hostile work environment complaints.

Average and below average employees are consistently being rated at average or above average due to their desire to please management while performing their tasks incorrectly or in a manner that has the potential to harm the reputation of BNYM.

I have witnessed more than one manager continuously turn a blind eye to those that are truly incompetent for those employees that are ""yes men"" while penalizing experienced professionals that are expressing a professional concern, in an effort to uphold the security and reputation of BNYM.

The currently utilized employee rating system in place (20/70/10) is absurd when attempting to build or rebuild entire groups, especially where groups are small in size. A group containing three members must rate one of those three as unsatisfactory even in situations where the employee has just been hired.

This alone makes BNYM a toxic environment and is a direct indicator of poor leadership. Though that system may work with well established groups, it is a complete failure otherwise and why so many companies have abandoned that practice.

It is impossible for an employee off a three to five member unit, where the employees have just been sought out for their talents and have been recruited, to assume that one of those three must be evaluated as unsatisfactory and therefore significantly reducing or negating bonuses and potential for 

Either there is a ""misunderstanding"" between the C-Level suite and mid/upper managers or there is an ignorance of proper leadership and implementation at the C-Level.

This is evidenced by the continuation of this rating system and has forced some of the most talented individuals in the industry to leave BNYM for better opportunities.

BNYM is hemorrhaging top talent and has allowed poor management to continue this situation. Mid management antics must be addressed or BNYM must accept that they will soon fall victim of their own hubris and be in a previous situation where they possessed no talent and their security program was the laughing stock of the financial sector.

Throwing more money at this problem is not the solution and if stock holders knew the actual security posture of BNYM, there would be serious consequences that the CISO would not be able to continue distorting.

The CISO is one of, if not THE significant stumbling blocks at BNYM due to his lack of listening skills and what appears to textbook narcissistic behavior. Though he is competent from a technical perspective within his narrowly focused experiences, he uses every circumstance to further his personal gains, putting himself first and BNYM second or third while berating those below.

CIO, I would suggest a more robust fact checking system for information received from the CISO and the now current deputy director of OPS, former global manager of incident management and forensics. They are one-in-the same when reporting the ""facts"". This will come around to hurt BNYM and you as the CIO in the future.

Helpful (7","A complete overhaul is in order with a focus on mid to upper cybersecurity related management, to include holding accountable and releasing management that is not effective or where their group has high turn-over rates.

When there are issues with one or two individuals, there is an employee related problem. When there are issues with several or more employees within the same group, there is a leadership problem - that is the case at BNYM.

At BNYM, there are very few leaders and the focus is heavy on ""managers"". Many of those managers ""rule"" via fear mongering to include outright badgering, yelling, screaming and a host of other unprofessional acts, to include personal insults that could or should lead to hostile work environment complaints.

Thu Nov 07 2019, Operations Analyst,"Pittsburgh, PA",Current Employee ,First Job out of College is What You Make It,3,"BNY Mellon is at a turning point in which it is transforming the way it does its work. This means massive efforts to digitize, automate, and change the way the bank does its work. Some very interesting things are coming out of our new-ish Digital group, and the effects of their projects are seen across the enterprise. This place can be a good (and easy) place to be hired out of college and its easy to quickly get exposure to senior leaders working on some of this transformative work. If you have dreams of going to a top business school or being a consultant or working at a tech company in some sort of product or strategy role, you can easily gain experience here and parlay it into something better. 

If that sounds interesting to you, do know that reaching out and networking is entirely at your discretion. Most entry level jobs at BNY are in Operations given the nature of BNY Mellon's work as a custody bank, and Operations at a custody bank is some of the worst work in financial services. Do not expect for the bank to expense meals, or for your coworkers to be driven and knowledgeable of financial services. Most of your coworkers will be hard workers, but they know only their functions and BNY Mellon's operational systems. They do not care or know anything about the greater markets in general and the job inst set up for you to be concerned about the state of the markets. You are expected to settle your trades, or process cash movements, or process a corporate action, and that's it. To some, this may be great, but to others, its horrific. This is NOT front office work and it doesn't really set you up for the front office after 6 months of time. This is not glamorous work; there are no bonuses, the pay is almost always below the average 2019 college grad salary (currently $51,000), there are no Christmas parties or lunch paid for by the bank, no coffee on the floor, no fancy work areas. Again: this is not glamorous work, but there is light at the end of the tunnel...

Digital and data and technology are the next best things in business, and as I mentioned above, BNY Mellon is investing in it at the right time. There are massively talented people working at BNY that work on this. There is a viable strategy in joining operations out of school, standing out of the Operations crowd through curiosity, networking, and hard work, and moving within 2 years into a strategy related role on the business side of things. From there, as long as you get some tangential digital experience, you'll be golden for top-MBA programs. Almost all your coworkers will be edging toward someday being the ops manager of their tea or a similar team, but very few are looking to transition onto the business side of things. Pay is better, exposure is higher, and they value operational experience, but YOU need to do the networking and be very proactive in your personal studies. When the opportunity comes your way, it pays dividends for your career when you can quote the most recent BCG or Accenture banking report and actually understand what it means for the firm or the business line you're interviewing for. That kind of business acumen, coupled with a good knowledge of the firm's operations will net you huge opportunity if you can stick it out in Operations for a year or two.
","If you do want to do more than Operations but are not the kind of person that can put yourself out there to constantly take on more work and meet new people that are far outside your business line, it is very easy to get stuck in ops for a long time. That being said, its not that operations is terrible. For many, it is easy work, no presentations, no clients, no dress code, no stress, but its not for those that want to have an impact.
Advice to Management
Keep doing Digital, its where the firm needs to go. I know this is the current path and that's good, but don't take your eyes off the prize. The digitization journey is going very well.

Employees and even upper Operations management MUST be traveling to sites like Pune, Manchester, Pittsburgh, Everett, and other Operations centers. The vast majority of the company works at these sites, rather than the big cities, and it would be very good for some of the upper ranks to see what working at BNY Mellon is really like. Working at a derivatives desk in Pittsburgh is an entirely different world than being a relationship manager on the 15th floor at 240 Greenwich in NYC. It makes employees feel poorly when the silent majority of the workforce is so poorly understood by the executives in other cities. Management needs to take the time to ""Go Gemba;"" to sit with everyday employees and understand what they actually do all day. The front office needs to know the issues that face the operations desk, and vice versa. Both world know nothing about each other. Thats partly a side-effect of the bank's size and global footprint, but I feel management could do a better job at bridging the gap. 

The Operations employee of the future should know how to query a SQL table, and also be able to articulate the differences between active and passive investing and why you'd choose one over the other. You currently see that the typical employee knows neither. Dont get behind in the race to the top; fees will only compress more and tech will further take over operations. Arm your workforce now.

Rude and obnoxious to those that report to them. Manager should not need to yell / berate employees one on one or in public. Should not silently mock (make faces) while employees that are dialed in are speaking.
- CEO pushed for open work areas, eliminated WFH, some WFH employees were let go only to have CEO opinion about WFH reversed after lawsuits.

","Short term: CEO and CIO implementing an uncompromising plan that every team has to rate someone unacceptable, and they've been having quarterly layoffs for five quarters now with no end in sight. Many of the best and brightest are leaving. Many political grudges are being settled. Many of the fearful lifers clinging. Overall, the plan to whip the slackers into shape (or dump them) is resulting in productivity depression and a higher, not lower, concentration of exceptional individuals. Long term: Custody Banking has been a challenging business for a decade, with no end in site.
Advice to Management
Treat people like your default assumption is that everyone *wants* to contribute, and if they don't, it's likely because the bureaucracy wore them down. Energize them, don't terrorize them. People aren't hardware. Dumping wholesale and buying shiny-new doesn't work, doesn't improve your company.

Management is destroying the company. Ever hear the saying “it rots from the top”? Well that applies here. The culture is one of backbiting, gossip, and retaliation with those using HR as a tool to get rid of co-workers they do not like. 


Layoffs/No Work from Home Arrangement 

Continued layoffs are hurting teams. Once the department or personnel is gone, their roles are not being filled. Their tasks are passed to other employees who are already stretched thin. Management is also getting rid of work from home arrangements.


Pay

The pay is not competitive within the industry. Employees are getting more work due to layoffs and added duties, but not seeing any salary increases.
Advice to Management
If more layoffs are going to happen, then do it! Make it quick and start clean! The more they continue to drag on with layoffs, the more morale will continue to tank. Top leaders and CEO’s of departments need to talk with their staff or have HR do interviews to really become aware of what is going on within these departments and why people keep quitting to go to competitors. Also create a track for career advancement and develop training programs. Your competitors already have these programs in place and so should you.

","Constant re-orgs leading to mass layoffs each quarter. No one knows what they want to do and nobody can make up their minds. When it comes time to actually making decisions, instead of leveraging the talent they have, they lay everybody off and hire from the outside...new employee onboarding was basically non-existent. There were previously 10+ layers in the organization so barely anything got done and messaging from top-down was also non-existent. There are so many old and manual processes and nobody ever seems to care how outdated they are...all talk and no action. So many workarounds and “excellence programs” in place to provide structure but in the end actually creates more duplicative work and lots of discrepancies. They think they are super innovative and act like a technology company but it’s all just a facade. Employee engagement and morale is low and there is an extreme culture here where it’s more important to show face than it is to get things done.
Advice to Management
Make up your mind with where you want this organization to go and stop trying to be something you’re not. Try to better recognize what your employees can bring to the table and not just as numbers that are expendable.

Elaborating on con #2, I think it's important to note that the business side will often talk about how the company is spending too much on technology and how the technology division makes no money. Sadly, this happens because the company is NOT a technology company, as mentioned several times by HR.

 Your average Software Engineer in the firm earns from 80 - 100k. That's not being overpaid, that's being UNDERPAID. Underneath all the smiles and sense of collaboration, nobody is actually passionate about the end product they work on. This leads towards people burning out or just not putting in their 100%.

Company has spent tax breaks on stock buybacks and raising the minimum hourly wage to $15/Hour. So congrats to that one person who wasn't making that.

Every year they'll spin something to us as a ""great new benefit"" but all it really is, is a reduction in a previous benefit.
Advice to Management
Stop making short-sighted decisions. I'll be honest, I am writing this because of the change in the remote work policy. This company used to take a lot of pride in allowing people the space to take care of their personal needs. Now it only seems to want to squeeze every ounce of productivity from people. There are 100 reasons why allowing people to work from home for a day or 2 week is beneficial. I am sure you will hear them all. In a time when most companies are saving rents and expanding remote working arrangements, BNY has decided that, for some reason, everybody needs to be in the office. This is a global company but we've decided to silo ourselves for the sake of increased collaboration. Is that really worth causing your employees added stress and hurting them financially in the process?

I've never been disappointed in this company until today.

Mon Feb 18 2019,Anonymous,"Northeast, NY",Current Employee ,Going Down Hill,22,"We have a great team with excellent support from our managers. We are all highly experienced professionals who are very good at what we do and focused on providing an excellent experience for our clients.
","Charlie Scharf joined the Bank about 18 months ago and recently embarked on a major reorganization effort intended to reduce the number of management layers between the top and bottom of the Bank. The intent was to make the Bank more nimble and client focused and to drive decision making down though the organization. There have been 2 – 3 rounds of layoffs in the past 6 months, and several thousand people have been separated from the Bank in the process. Being nimble and more client focused is a great idea, although most managers now have 10 – 15 direct reports, which makes it difficult for them to be anything other than reactive. As a result, there is little time for proactive planning, employee development, etc. Additionally, some teams are overwhelmed trying to do the same work with 50% (or more) less people. 

Up until recently, many employees were permitted to work from home (WFH) 2 – 3 days per week. However, Charlie’s drive to eliminate WFH throughout the Bank is a classic example of fixing something that wasn’t broken. His reason for the change, to increase collaboration and communication, ignores the reality that many co-workers and teams are already dispersed nationally, if not globally. The roll out was botched and left many alienated and feeling mislead: Employees who had been using WFH for years responsibly and successfully, were required to reapply for permission to WFH via an online tool. We were told at the beginning of the process that no decisions had been made about WFH. However, nearly all WFH requests were denied and the online tool appears to have been little more than cover for a decision Charlie had already made. BNY Mellon isn’t a place known for high compensation, but WFH made up for that in improving work life balance, supporting dual income families, and in reducing weekly commuting time / expense. 

Charlie was questioned about employee morale in two recent town hall meetings. He stated he doesn’t have a “magic wand” and that unhappy employees would likely self-select and leave the Bank. Those remaining would have basically have suck it up and be glad they have jobs. The reality is that the talent flight out of the Bank has begun and is picking up speed. Elimination of WFH will make it harder to recruit new employees and is at odds with efforts to grow diversity at the Bank, which Charlie claims to support.

It’s really sad, because I used to think BNY Mellon was a great place to work. Now, not so much.

","It’s the type of company that if someone asks a question about something, it suddenly becomes a hot topic then quickly forgotten about. I was asked to put something together my first day, and it quickly was forgotten about.

In addition, I’ve never been in a job where our role isn’t taken seriously or given priority. It doesn’t matter whether it’s trying to get a new tool to help the team, doing actual work, or trying to do a share-point. My second week when my boss left for an on site project, I was given no direction or tasking to complete. Quite a welcome for a new person. Our team was never taken seriously and never taken as a priority by anyone.

In addition, if you don’t get in the right role you’ll end up under bank lifers who really don’t care about you professionally and will be happy to give you busy work assignments or tell you to find something else to do. Of course they have enough work for themselves. If you’re driven and like to do things (especially in Technology), this isn’t the place for you. You’ll be schmoozed to death about what work is coming, but in reality you do nothing that is anyone’s priority. You’ll end up sitting around 95 percent of the time with occasionally getting some emails or a response on the few things you actually work on. Everyday feels like it’s a slow time of year since the pace of work is slow. “The holiday season” exists from November to March, and “summer vacation season” lasts May through September if you get my vibe. My management never tried to get us more work as much as they said they did. My direct boss was a nice person.

Also, I saw my boss’ boss maybe a total of 5 times. He basically would be a ghost while providing the team manager real work to do, all while he pretended to know and pretended to care what we worked on with calls once in a while. It’s obvious he could give a crap about his people considering he didn’t even reach out to any of us who left out after 10 months or a year and a half. Oddly enough I’d see his bosses at least 2-3 times a month.

By far the weirdest place for technology. If you are ready to coast and transition from an operations role, it’s a great place. If you’re motivated and like to learn and not work part time, stay far away.

Actually care about your people especially when they address concerns regarding lack of workload, and make sure that everyone has enough to do. Take an interest in their professional lives and growing them as professionals, not just putting a butt in the seat. Also every tasking should have a requirement to have some area of the bank participate in it. If you are not required by a policy, nobody will participate in your program.

Advice to Management
Please acknowledge legacy employees contributions and value additions.
Don’t threaten work life balance, don’t assume working from home means not working. 
An influx of too many new hires is an influx of too much risk if there isn’t enough heads to train.

","Since King Charles III took over as CEO, it's his way or the highway. The latest harebrained scheme is to force people to come to the office every day instead of working from home. In this day and age, that's just moronic. Most people face horrible commutes in urban traffic, and when you could spend that time being productive, it's just a Dilbert cartoon brought to life. But, the King has spoken, and his subjects must obey, or quit and look for a better work environment. 

The other idiotic idea from the '80s is that 10% of each group must be rated as 'not meeting expectations'. Why? Because some corporate goal wasn't met in 2017. Now, you might think that management, especially upper management, would be held responsible for that, but no. They decided to punish people below a fairly low level instead. So the CIO gets $10,000,000 a year, and we get screwed.

I don't know what's wrong with these people. Maybe it's just the disconnect between multi-millionaires and the lives of the worker bees.

BNY Mellon Response
December 13, 2018 – Talent &amp; Development
Thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review, and for your hard work as a Corporate Trust Associate at BNY Mellon.

A key priority for BNY Mellon is to ensure that we have a strong management team with world-class leadership capabilities. As part of our efforts to enhance our leadership at the company, we introduced a new Leadership Competency model to define which leadership attributes are distinctive to BNY Mellon to create a competitive advantage. We also refreshed our company’s vision and mission statements to clearly articulate what BNY Mellon sees as its fundamental purpose and what our company and our people aim to do every day. In our last two employee engagement surveys, more employees say senior management has a clear vision for the future, they have confidence in decisions made by senior management, and senior management communicates openly and honestly. 

BNY Mellon is committed to offering its employees opportunities for career development and growth. Our promotions process involves job re-levelling where an employee, if eligible, can apply to an open position at a higher level. Another way an employee can progress is if their current role changes, such that the scope, complexity and level of responsibility have changed significantly. Determinations for job re-levelling are made between the employee, their manager and the leadership team of their department.

We invest in each employee’s personal and professional wellbeing because we understand that our clients’ success, as well as our ultimate success, starts with you.

","Management always shifting priorities and poor communication. Most projects I work on become unimportant as focus shifts. Company reinvents a lot of wheels and duplicates efforts. Too much process and restriction around things like simply deploying software or accessing a database
Advice to Management
Put engineers closer to customers and stop putting offshore processes between me and access to resources

I have been working at BNY Mellon full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
The ability to work from home occasionally is a huge reason I’m still with the company. Medical premiums are low for a family if using an HSA which works great for us. Schedule is flexible
Cons
Hard to get help with new projects with direction or where to go to get things done. So many SMEs were let go and India has stepped in. India help is great in some ways but extremely insufficient in other ways. Time zone, communication differences, etc.
Advice to Management
Stop sending more work offshore.

Great work life balance
Friendly work environment
Extremely talented and intelligent people can mentor you (if you find them)
","Almost no structure for talent development 
Definite possibility of getting stuck in a junior position 
Feel underpaid for the level of responsibility 
Learning can hit a wall
Advice to Management
Little to no structure for younger employees.. I would say nearly 90% of everyone who starts out of college leaves within 1-2 years. It's possible to stay in an analyst position for 4-5 years without promotion, I find this unacceptable.
