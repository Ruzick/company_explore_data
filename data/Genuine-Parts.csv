Fri Oct 30 2020, ITOC Incident and Problem Manager,"Atlanta, GA",Former Employee ,Not So Genuine! Worst Experience Ever! Run From This Company!,0,"There were no pros with this company!
","Avoid this company like the plague. Here is a recent event that should create hesitation before accepting any job with the corporate headquarters at Genuine Parts Company in Atlanta, GA. I was offered the job on Monday, Oct. 27, 2020. The salary was low for this Atlanta market, but the Sr. Director and Director of the department seemed amazingly smart and certainly two individuals I could learn a lot from and partner with on additional successes with the organization, so I thought this was a win/win to pursue the opportunity. I had no problem with the compensation as it was outlined before the offer was submitted and presented. However, when I received my $100K offer from HR, they failed to provide me any benefit information and the bonus plan advertised was 5% less than was mentioned. I was originally informed that I would be eligible for a 15% bonus each review period and now on the offer was at 10%. They also failed to share with me any other benefits the company offered. This was surprising as this should be a normal step in the onboarding of candidates which I thought was extremely bizarre. They just wanted me to sign their DocuSign document to make it a done deal without knowing all the particulars of the role. This was a very shady interaction with the HR Department, and it was apparent why now. I asked for their benefits package information to ensure I made the best and informed decision before joining GPC. I had other offers in the pipeline when I decided that I would give GPC my all and turned down those opportunities to pursue this new career. In addition, medical benefits are certainly important for everyone these days, especially, for someone who has a known disability, as I do. Once the benefits information was finally provided, I learned that I was only offered 5-days of vacation for the first year and I would not be eligible to use it within the first 61-days of employment. They also controlled how many “hours” one person could take for medical appointments in a year, and again, only after 61-days of employment. Who does this for salary based 24/7/365 on-call associates? In addition, their medical insurance was one of the worse plans I have ever seen in my 30+ year career. They certainly do not take care of their “valued” employees nor do they support the health of their associates from what I could tell by their so call self-insurance plan. It is basically, a Cobra healthcare plan. Since I have my own insurance and my need for specialists is hard to come by, I asked if the health benefits they afforded to all their associates could be reallocated to my compensation base pay so I could use it to pay my higher healthcare premiums. I also asked for 3-weeks of vacation for the first two years knowing how much time I was going to invest in developing this role and department with the leaders in place. Then on October 29, 2020, only three days later, they withdrew the offer. They are living in the 1950s where the appreciation for industry talent and human capital is not valued. It is apparent with the lack of organization and willingness to work with a person with disabilities. After withdrawing the offer, she had the audacity to say, “We truly wish you the best in your future endeavors. Please do not hesitate to reapply with GPC should you find a position that is better aligned with your compensation requirements.” Like I would want to go through this again. This company is truly a joke and just does not live up to their company name of “genuine.” Avoid! Please, do not put your family through the failures I just experienced with this organization.
Advice to Management
You all need to reconsider who you have running your HR Department. The experience I underwent should not have been so such a difficult or a horrible experience. A simple “no, we can't accommodate your requests,” would have been understandable. But, withdrawing my offer after weeks of my invested time during interviews, etc. was extremely unprofessional. To reach this conclusion without a fair chance was appalling. Apparently, you are very biased towards people with disabilities. You would think that a billion-dollar organization would have a much better onboarding experience. I am now so appreciative that I learned what this organization was about before joining and spending countless days and weekends supporting an organization who does not support their associates as they should.

Mon Aug 10 2020, Sales Representative,"Atlanta, GA",Former Employee ,"Nice People in Company, ""Boys Club"" amongst higher ups",3,"Independent ""Jobbers"" (store owners) and people working in the DC (warehouse and office) are some of the best, genuine, and nicest people! If you get in with the ""in crowd/boy's club"" of the company, you'll be promoted and taken care of by the ""higher ups.""
","Have to be willing to move out of state to really move up in the company.
Since it is a publicly traded company, there is great pressure on the boys in Atlanta to always show they're in ""the black"" and since sales has overall been going down the past 5-6 years, lots of layoffs among the DCs (Distribution Centers) have occurred among office staff. Also, they recently did away with their entire Southwest Division and laid off most division staff, thus closed their Dallas HQ. In the corporate stores Managers work about 50-60+ hours a week and are constantly needing staff. Though the managers are told to ""get there numbers up"" to get more staff. The HR department has a very high turnover rate, and many DCs will have a different HR manager every year. 
Company focus has changed overall the past 10 years from wholesale to retail. NAPA's ""bread & butter"" use to be their wholesale auto mechanic shops, and had many sales reps to drive this business. Which worked well for 70+ years. But little by little they have downsized their sales and product reps to spend more company focused money of retail and oversees business. They are now trying to compete with O'Reillys and AutoZone and Advance to gain more retail walk-in business. BUT, they fail to realize the average joe wants price over quality, unlike the auto-mechanic shops who prefer quality over price. Thus they have let O'Reillys, Advance, and Auto Zone creep in on their wholesale business and NAPA is spread very thin because of it. Now NAPA has decided to enter into the oversees market very aggressively and has had to layoff more and more people because money distribution use. Their is also a big push to get one NAPA ""jobber"" independent store owner to own several locations, not just one. The higher ups feel it's easier to meet with 20 owners who own 3-8 stores each than 120 owners in a market. The higher ups believe it's easier to ""sell"" 20 people on an idea, than ""120"" people, but what they are failing to realize is the Jobbers will end up having more control over campaigns, etc. when less jobbers control most of the territory market. Jobbers are already meeting secretly and unionizing against corporate and in many cases selling out entire markets to NAPA competitors.
Advice to Management
Tell the share holders you need to ""spend money to make money."" Refocus for nest 3-5 years and take a step back. Focus on rebuilding your wholesale business (which you've lost in many markets) and go back to basics. Hire more staff for your Store managers. Bring back part/brand reps. Make less ""leisure"" trips on the corporate jet. Make sure the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. Take care of your Jobbers better. People in the company feel like just a ""number,"" make them feel like family again. The bottom line: Take care of your customers, by taking care of your employees.
*If you keep going the road you're going Amazon or some big online presence is going to buy the NAPA name and their will be no retail store, jobbers, or GPC in the future. There is no such thing as ""too big to fail.""

If you go one minute over 40 hours you get written up as it is unauthorized overtime. If you leave sick even if it is legitimate, you are written up for leaving work without permission. As there are no policies in place that actually work properly your manager can change everything in a split second and then write you up for not knowing how to do your job.

You are entirely responsible for your computer so if anyone touches it you get in trouble. Things that go on sale are usually not even in stock. Not to mention the random distribution center orders in the middle of the day. Regularly they send us tons of pallets at any random moment of the day. The inventory scanning system is setup stupidly to beep multiple times to try and tell you where that part belongs whether it be stock for a customer or on the sales floor. There is this absolutely awful customer support line for every single thing you want to do. I spend more time waiting for phone calls from places like Georgia than I do quoting parts.

The new CEO just steps in and steers the ship. This theory remains until the market changes or new outside forces come into play that require change.

The NAPA brand, part of Genuine Parts, is well known, and runs a great distribution operation and is world class and leading edge in that area. Working in a NAPA DC is great way to learn how to run a distribution business.
","The company is stable now but has a hard time embracing change, and change is greatly needed. If top management continues to run the business as it has in the past, it will continue to degrade. Politics at the highest of levels are brutal and tolerated by management. The company shouldn't be managed by ego, it should be managed by values. 

Many have been at the company their entire careers, so outside of distribution, best practices are not in place. 

Most top managers come from the field, so opportunities for advancement for those who have not worked in the field are limited, and it is clear that advancement is tough without field experience. The culture is outdated and though they are trying, old customs that are foreign to younger folks are still commonplace.

Though there are individuals who would like to see more diversity, the value of diversity is not understood across the organization. Generally, if you can make it a year then you will be able to make it at the company. There are expectations of behavior and unspoken rules that you'll have to pick up on fast to be successful.

","The HR department didn't advocate for the employees. If an employee went to HR with any issue against anyone in management, HR would go straight to the director and it was a given that we would be discussing that issue in a managers meeting... and that person went on ""the list."" There was no such thing as privacy. If HR knows, every manager and supervisor in the building knows. If am employee wanted action, they had to call the toll free complaint line. Management hated that, but it guaranteed that an objective 3rd party would be looking into the issue and your job wouldn't be at stake. 

Dishonest upper management (lots of character issues), lack of concern for employees, attendance policy for hourly employees appears to be very liberal, but is in fact a trap. I once had to write up an employee for not returning to work on the 4th day after their father died. 

The management team had an ""understood"" 90 day rule. If for any reason we didn’t like you, it was almost guaranteed that you would be dismissed by day 90 of employment because ""you were not a good fit."" Very few opportunities for advancement. 

The director is an ABSOLUTE BULLY! When he was brought on, he stopped internal promotions and only hired external candidates. This went on for a couple of years until headquarters forced him to promote from within first. He was very difficult to work for, as he was extremely condescending and said on many occasions that we should just be happy to have a job because the unemployment rates were high. There was always an underlying threat when he talked to us. 

Within the first 2 years of himy being hired, many of our tenured hourly and management staff had been fired or quit. After another couple of years, many of us (managers/supervisors ( resigned because we couldn't take the ever increasing work hours, ever decreasing pay raises and bonuses, and his ""my way or the highway"" attitude.
Advice to Management
First and foremost, get a new director. Treat employees like people instead of machines. Recognize that life happens outside of your attendance policy, allow people to move beyond past mistakes instead of using the mistakes against them for years...even after they have shown growth and change...and make senior leadership accountable. Stop firing hourly employees for attendance infractions, when one of your top managers has had ongoing, unjustified attendance issues for years. And lastly, stop finding reasons to fire people just because you don't like them.

","Too many hours. Stress level very high. Stores open every holiday except Thanksgiving and Christmas day.
Advice to Management
Lighten the work load on store managers. Stores are not fully staffed. Shorten the holiday hours so employees can enjoy them with their family and friends. The company has followed the competition with being open long hours on holidays. If we, as a company would close, say on the 4th of July or Labor day, and promote it as a way to show we care about our employees, I would bet the competition would follow our lead. Being open almost regular store hours on holidays in reality costs the company money with wages, utilities, etc. As an example, being open 8am until 5pm on New Years day is ridiculous. Many store managers work that day, but don't have any customers until about 10am, if that. Mostly the store manager gets year end paperwork together and cleans things up and that's it. Wouldn't 10am until 2pm be good enough? Being open 9-10 hours requires more people on duty.

The management in Texas is the most demotivating unpleasant person you could work for. He will turn a positive upbeat situation into a depressing glooming cloud.

Thu Jul 31 2014, IT Manager,,Current Employee ,Mixed bag for IT,8,"I'll borrow from some previous posts - as GPC has several different divisions and operations under its corporate umbrella, my feedback focuses on those at 3100 Wildwood in Atlanta. Among other groups, 3100 houses IT for the largest division, automotive parts (NAPA) and Shared Services (focused on network infrastructure).

This is a very conservative, stable and well-performing company that has been in operation close to a century. As previously mentioned, salaries appear competitive with other Fortune 500 companies, and I agree that the time to negotiate salary and PTO is during the hiring process. The company pays a regular bonus to certain employees based on company and division performance (it is not tied to any individual metrics). Benefits and 401k are in line with other large companies; although, be prepared to wait 90 days to become eligible (not something that's clearly advertised during the hiring process). Work life balance really depends on the group or project that you report to and can vary widely with some groups working multiple weekends.

If you're in an area of IT like Supply Chain, Financials (JDE, PeopleSoft), Business Intelligence, infrastructure, there are a lot of good and worthy projects as the company runs on its ability to manage parts distribution to its Distribution Centers, NAPA stores and other partners. For better or worse, the company had a culture of promoting from within, which means many employees have spent most of their career at GPC, or they're part of a recent wave of hires over the last 2-3 years. Although this has provided a pool of very tenured and knowledgeable employees on the business, the company is out of step with many current best practices especially with regards to IT and slow to change.
","For those looking for an IT role in digital, ecommerce, application development, get clarity on what you will be working on and make sure it's a fit or think twice before joining . The company is years behind the competition, industry and best practices in this space and has outsourced the majority of this work to 3rd parties (especially the most interesting and engaging work). Most of the roles advertised in these areas tend to be focused more on operational and support activities rather than on designing and developing great applications and solutions. There appears to be little support for bringing more of this work in-house and IT spend and investment as a percentage of revenue seems low to comparably sized companies.

On the people side, senior management has tried to make some strides in changing the culture and updating the processes, but this too has been a mixed bag. Corporate still wears ties, and it was only recently that jeans were permitted on Friday's only for IT. A one day a week work at home policy is being trialed for IT, but the process has been overly regulated out of fear of abuse which leads some to think that senior management doesn't trust it's managers or employees. The mix of career GPC 'lifers' and recent hires makes for a somewhat strange culture. Furthermore, the performance management process is a shambles with no clear direction on performance expectations, transparency of ratings, mentoring/coaching and training. Several quality people have recently left the IT organization due to poor leadership and management.

Fri Jun 13 2014, IT Administrative,"Atlanta, GA",Current Employee ,"Safe, stable, and fun environment",3,"Let's clear some fog from other reviews. Regardless of the company, there will always be those who feel entitled or more valuable than they actually are. ","stent, accurate work is rewarded. I've personally witnessed several people move about within the company, from position to position. I also know of several corporate employees who were once NAPA store associates. Anyone that says there's no movement within the company isn't looking or lacks the aptitude to fill a position.

There are several physical corporate locations that are under the GPC umbrella; I'll comment on 3100 in Wildwood. A former IBM building located in a wooded area with covered parking and access to Chattahoochee natural trail system. There's a small cafe open for breakfast and lunch sandwiches. Beverage coolers are located on all building levels and are stocked with sodas and juices (this also includes the HQ building). 

401K and health benefits are excellent and there's no shortage of options to choose from.

Salaries are competitive with any other Fortune 200 company. If you're offered a position, most of us know that this is the time to negotiate salary and PTO options. Being corporate, annual reviews are precise and timely. Annual bonuses, if applicable, which are comprised of company, department, and personal goals, are also precise and timely. Pay increases are generally based upon annual reviews and are reflected annually.

For those considering an IT position, you'll be glad to know that the majority of the teams are full of talented professionals. There are exceptions to every team. Depending on department/group, you'll most likely receive new computer hardware and the option to either select a mobile device (iPhone or Android) or use your own and receive a stipend. 

Pending project timelines, 40+ hours a week is not unheard of, although this stands mostly anywhere. There's great flexibility in work schedules but the policy seems to float between managers. Some of us work from home 2+ days a week. Comp time is also given to those who work outside normal duty hours. Training opportunities for professional certifications are available on an annual basis but out-of-state course requests will be denied.
Cons
GPC is definitely built on older principles and values. This isn't necessarily a negative blow; check the stock prices and annual profits since the late 50's. That being said, the ""slow and steady"" mentality is applied to all groups which can prevent creative thinking or disruptive innovation from taking root. I do believe this is slowly changing and will continue to develop as the younger generation replaces 30+ year employees.

Depending on your manager/director and their management style, this may or may not be the place for you. While some managers and their employees are very continent, others are living a nightmare. To this degree, upper management within the VP, C, and E levels lack a lending ear.. This mentally wears the good, competent employees to the point of exhaustion, then resignation. Seeing people move about in the company, I've also seen people remove themselves entirely from the company due to poor management.

No jeans with the exception of Fridays. <- This makes no sense to me...
