","Ridiculous expectations, no communication from corporate to leadership, huge disconnect from corporate to the bakeries, technology overhauls are done at cut-rate budgets, making the “new” worse than the old, the working environment is toxic at best, nobody knows where to go for information, the turnover in salary staff is incredible.
Advice to Management
Look into why your people are leaving. This turnover is not sustainable. Maybe send your corporate people into a bakery before making tech changes to ensure the change actually meets their needs. Stop bragging/advertising the work from home life that is not afforded to everybody. Offer a better defined career path. Change the culture in bakeries to accept some flexibility and work-life balance. If you aren’t willing to work 14 hours a day, you are seen as being difficult. No matter that every time someone quits, everyone who is left just picks up their roles for months until they are replaced (or indefinitely because the company has decided not to fill the role). When we say we are stretched thin, trust us - we are!

Tue Jun 30 2020, Sales Service Representative (Merchandiser),"Corpus Christi, TX",Current Employee ,Easy work and okay compensation. But hours are volatile and training for heavy machinery is not provided.,0,"Halfway decent compensation, .53 cents per mile while driving on the clock, independent work without the boss breathing down your neck. Easy work once you get the hang of it after a couple of weeks on the job.
","Hours go way up and way down unexpectedly. Some weeks you may get 35 hours, some 10 hours. The mileage compensation only begins after the first 25 miles on your way to the first store, so if you wake up and drive to a store 24 miles away, you get zero mileage compensation for that. However, you still get compensation for all miles driven in between stores, but the same rule applies for going home after your last store. If after your last store, you have to drive 24 miles to get home, no compensation. While working, you are representing the company and although you don't write the orders, you will often be the recipient of frustrations by the store managers. The biggest con of all is the use of motorized FORKLIFT JACKS. It is Mondelez policy that no one can use them for concerns regarding safety. However, it is basically a requirement to use it anyways if you don't want to spend all day at one store wasting your time waiting for a store manager to get off their butts, do their job, and get it down for you. Its nearly impossible unless you're willing to wait sometimes an HOUR for them to bring down ONE pallet of backstock. Because you're forced to use them against company policy, if an accident happens, you are responsible. Considering this, don't even apply unless you have experience using forklift jacks unless you're willing to put yourself at risk by trying to learn it on your own. Prepare to be called in a lot if you're good at your job. When other people call in sick or can't make it to a store, the bosses will lean on you as a crutch if they know that they can count on you always saying yes. Totally inconsistent scheduling, for most shifts I was only notified of them less than a day prior, which makes planning anything in your personal life almost impossible since you never know if you're working tomorrow.
Advice to Management
Fix the scheduling problem and give your workers at least 3 days notice before any shift unless they are covering for someone who called in. Train your employees to use the forklift jack. If that isn't possible for whatever reason, then consistently stress to the store managers the importance of getting pallets down in a timely manner. Putting worker's livelihoods and safety at risk for not going to bat for them with store managers or training them to use heavy machinery is downright wrong.

By senior leaders I mean those who are above section managers. I’ve worked at other large companies and never have seen anything like this.

Thu May 31 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Has Potential to be a ""Great Place to Work"" but Needs to Improve Culture",3,"Attempting to implement Integrated Lean Six Sigma IL6S (commonly known as TPM). The structure and tools could significantly improve work environment and performance, if implemented properly and all functional levels support and practice it. 

I really enjoy the products made. 

Many great co-workers.

Being an international company, there are many great resources to use for your development and everyday work, if you choose to find and utilize them. They are typically not promoted or generally shared; you have to search for and ask for them. 

Good pay. 

Great vacation! Started with 20 days of PTO. Every 5yrs, you get 5 more days of PTO.
","High turn-over, especially among management- both within corporate and at plant level. This means priorities and initiatives are frequently changing, creating a ""flavor of the month"" mentality and lack of interest or commitment to these initiatives among long-term employees. 

Lack of promotion contributes to high turn-over. Tend to hire external candidates, rather than promote internal employees. Management seems to like the idea of hiring from competitors to gain knowledgeable employees who were trained by other companies. They do not invest in training and developing current employees or building skills internally. 


WARNING: they tend to speak highly in interviews and make ""promises"" to get you in their doors, but then do not keep those promises. If it's important to you, get them to commit to it in writing!

Burn-out is also a huge problem, contributing to high turnover. Especially at the plant level, there is a perception that salaried employees need to work 10+hr days and be readily available to work weekends and odd shifts. Also, with the ever-changing new initiatives, new responsibilities- though often seemingly non-value-added- are frequently added to every role at all functional levels- rarely removing other non-value-added responsibilities. 
Another contributing factor, hard-working employees tend to have to absorb the responsibilities of others- whether it be picking up the slack of another employee or fulfilling the responsibilities of a former employee who will not be replaced. Usually this tactic is easy savings. As a supervisor, I absorbed the role of another supervisor who was promoted and chose not to replace himself. As a continuous improvement engineer, I absorbed the role of my manager- who was never replaced. I was also not given a promotion or raise for assuming my manager's responsibilities. 

Poor communication. 

Lack of appreciation. 

Celebration of or recognition for successes is rare. ""Failure"" is not viewed as a learning opportunity. Due to poorly executed ""high accountability"", there is a general sense of fear of the repercussions of ""failure"" among motivated employees- until they became burnt out and just don't care about work anymore. This has caused some of my co-workers to be extremely cautious- not open and honest- and non-committing of their communications, often leading to miscommunications. It also frequently causes coworkers to ""throw others under the bus"" to defend themselves. 

Distinguishable ""Cliques"".
Advice to Management
The company has great values and ideas- especially with IL6S! Focus on living those values and properly executing IL6S. IL6S clearly provides a pathway to take you to the next level! Believe in it! Believe in the pillar work processes and follow through with them- especially Rewards and Recognition, Skill Matrix, Kaizen. Don't just ask for 100% Engagement because you are being told to- truly want it, believe in it, and embrace it!

With an open-mind, evaluate the high-turnover rate. Utilize your findings to change your culture. You are capable of being a ""Great Place to Work"" if everyone practices what they preach. (ie: ""Celebrate the Red!"" “Servant Leadership,” ""Be Open and Inclusive,"" ""Learn Do Teach,"" ""Plan Do Check Act"") 

Best Wishes! I know that you can make the change. You have the tools! Believe and Follow Through!!

Try to project to the field that you care about solving all the obstacles that they face out in the marketplace. Such as providing adequate help on heavy case days.....not having employees travel extreme distances to their 1st stops in the mournings. Knowing what town employees live in so they can schedules them accordingly. Not having different salesmen and especially merchandisers crossing territories and working in more than one territory. Don't take a merchandiser from their home area and put someone else in that area and move the home person sometimes where the other person is coming from. Use bonuses more effectively.....let employees know that they met their goals and that they will receive that bonus. Instead of just looking at your payroll check and seeing that you got the quarter bonus or whatever bonus it may be.

I started with the company as a part timer in 2015. I was promoted in 7 months. I loved the management in St. Louis. Very caring, communication was great. When my car stop working, my supervisor picked me up and we worked together to complete stores. When I had questions, my supervisor listened and solved issues that needed to be addressed. I've transfer 3 times, went to Savannah area. The management wasnt as family oriented however as long as you were making your sale goals, they were okay with you. Also, I appreciate the training and sales techniques Ive learned in Savannah. I transfer to Atlanta and wasnt their too long simply because management do things different. I was under a lot of pressure when it came to work load and getting done under 40 hours with little help and staffing. I also felt like I wasn't able to use my talents like I was able to do at Savannah and St. Louis. My advice for only Atlanta management is to value your good workers who are willing to complete the job of those who lack. Focus on hiring more staff for sales representative territory who are over worked simply because theirs not enough staff and current staff that doesn't complete their job.

","Abhorrent working conditions akin to working in a coal mine. Enough talc in the air to choke and the mint is so strong it's like slathering icy hot all over your body while your nose is running and you are involuntarily crying. Their way of dealing with employee morale is to clamp down a little harder when you are unhappy and ""if you don't like it, there's the door"" (yes, I have heard this more than once). Sometimes the mandate to work on Saturday comes 5 minutes before you leave on Friday, although after 18 straight months of Saturdays you come to expect it. I have personally watched them break labor laws and lie to their employees about what the laws actually state, only to change their tune after complaints are made. And then pick up the same line of lies later. Everyone makes the same wage per labor grade, which encourages many people to do very little, and the max labor grade is not comparable to many manufacturing jobs in the area. If you are offered the opportunity to become a team lead, they call it a developmental position. This is where you take on all of the responsibilities of a manager/supervisor while getting paid the same wage you were previously making, and regularly string people along for periods of years or until you are fed up with it and step down. If you are able to befriend someone in senior management, they might create a meaningless job title for you which has lead to a significantly top heavy structure filled with dead weight.

Wed Oct 18 2017, Warehouse,"Weston, FL",Former Employee ,Warehouse hours will run you into the ground,2,"The pay was good, the guys were all pretty cool.
","I have almost 20 years of warehouse experience so I'm used to hard work and would still be at Mondelez Int. in Weston, Fl if it weren't for the hours. Yes the work is hard, but it would be OK if they had regular hours. You get there in the morning and find out how many trucks have to be loaded for the day. They can't keep employees so they are short-staffed so then we would have maybe 6 of us to operate 3 lines. One person walking up and down the line with a headset pulling all the product and another at the end loading everything on a pallet and wrapping the pallet. Both jobs are a pretty good workout for each person. It probably takes about 3 to 4 hours to load a truck with approximately 20 pallets. Sometimes longer. We had 10 trucks to load yesterday so 2 lines had 3 trucks and one line (the fastest guys) had 4 trucks to load. That right there kinda sucks, because the two guys who are always the fastest ones there always get done first so they get the next trucks paperwork and have to do another truck. They are the fastest and they are very good also so it sucks that they have to get the most work. They should be rewarded not punished. Everybody there talked about how the hours were so bad and after looking at warehouse reviews from all over you would think management would try to do something about it. Another thing management should consider is any miss-picks are probably done when the guys are going into their 11th, 12th, 13th etc. hour and they are tired and sweating profusely and dropping boxes.

You need to hire more people and have more lines running so the guys can get out of there at a decent hour and not pulling 15-17 hour work days. The thing that everybody talked about all the time when I was there was how the hours were killing them.

- I worked with some of the smartest people I've ever met, and I had some really great, inspirational managers (middle management only - senior management is a totally different story).
- Compensation in marketing (in the US, at least) is above market average.
","- Career pathing in marketing has fallen off a cliff. What used to be a world of opportunity is now very limited, both in terms of geography (very few global roles remain) and scope (marketing roles are now overly specialized in the regions). 
- Most big CPGs are bogged down by process, but Mondelez is even more so. It's no wonder the company is not hitting its growth targets - bureaucracy and politics are major inhibitors to growth here.
- While I can't say the culture is bad, I can say it is nonexistent - which is almost worst. There's no camaraderie among colleagues in the NA business unit, because everyone is miserable and no one wants to be there anymore. It's sad to see such talented people so unmotivated.

Mileage pay is about 10 cents per mileage under the IRS recommended amount.
They do expect you to be on call and your hours can fluctuate unexpectedly so that the full time rehired after they quit employees can get their 40 hours.

","By far the most resturing company I've ever seen. The do more with less attitude is at a high especially when it comes to jobs. They reduce headcount and throw another job at you to do with your own but still only pay you for one. Four years now, no raises for the hourly employees (you get a lump sum check based off some number) that is split over several months at high tax rate and doesn't consider any overtime. Management placates employee concerns by saying they are working on them but then something else always takes precedence. Corporate managers are always looking to get any extra pennies they can squeeze out of the companies for their bonus'. The CEO make 20 million in bonus' while the worker jumps through hoops of fire to get a check that MAY make then a single week of pay. No advancement in the company...they are happy to let you stay at a low level but let you work the job of someone who is supposed to work at a higher salary (and the call it ""Developmental"" for over 2 years) and then just hire from an outside source. Instead of putting people into jobs they know how to do or are exceptional at they go by seniority (even in a non-union plant) and most job opportunities they post already have candidates for them pre-selected. No more company cookouts or anything as the Senior management has limited the plant to spending only 40$ a year per person for any perks.

","- Workload is ridiculous :

Perception does not match reality. 10-12 hr HARD labor expected to be conpleted in an 8 hour time frame. It's a flawed system and if you're a merchandiser, you better hope you get a professional sales representative that doesn't overwork you and never appreciates your willingness to be a team player.

- Upper management disconnect:

Greedy investors and head choppers at the top demonstrate a lack of sense or empathy to reality: Sales goals are 90% unattainable.


Your customers :

Industry clients like Kroger and Safeway are used to top tier service- so your all is never enough. If you like your phone ringing off the hook at 5 in the morning because a load hasn't been worked- this is the company for you. Customers cry about everything from backstock, to why they're not the first ones being serviced on a non service day. You'll never make everyone happy no matter what you do.

Absolutely NO WORK/LIFE balance:


If you're a family man, plan to be one or want to work 8 hour days to avoid traffic, this is NOT your company. You 85% of the time never get our the time you should. If you call your manager or sales rep for help , it can be draining experience with constant interrogation about why you couldn't throw up countless amounts of cases in an allocated amount of short time. Drive time/store issues are never taken into consideration: broken system. Say goodbye to your social life...you're a slave to your job.

No structure: 

See above. The company needs to revamp outdated scheduling system that is not followed anyway due to geographic and time flaws. Management never addresses the elephant in the room of poor scheduling. In some cases it adds work to your day.

There is no time in the day to ""sell in"" extra product. The company just restructured due to investor pressure but wants to utilize sales reps in multi selling/merchandising roles with lack of or horrid help which decreases sales revenue and just burns people out causing them to want to leave the company altogether.

Workload : 

Do you want to be a glorified merchandiser? This is the job for you. 

Wake up at 3-4am, throw upwards of about 300-500 cases with an expectation to write orders, build rapport and sell extra product- not gonna happen. Look at your back rooms! Stop forcing reps to sell in more oreos and chips ahoy when your back rooms are a mess.


Promotion? Good luck.

It's a who you know business. Some promotions don't match the work of the individual being promoted. The continued ""passing of the torch "" to unqualified individuals with zero business ethics is making a revolving door and your best people are walking through it!

High changeovers due to moral discontent. 

Changing landscape:

GMO, Organic and Glutten free solutions are not being addressed properly by this company. It will drive sales to the ground. Good Thins isn't enough.

Job instability:

The company just went through some major changes this year (as it does every few years). People with the company for decades lost their jobs due to shipment of jobs to othwe countries or were demoted due to cuts- more to come soon.
Advice to Management
I can't stress this enough : LISTEN to your PEOPLE. Upper management is slave to the ends instead of the means of making quota.

Instead of throwing unachievable sales goals for payouts we will never be rewarded due to lack of performance, top managers need to work hand in hand with the people at the ""bottom of the totem pole"" to truly grasp how long it actually takes to throw a load or deal with store managers.

Stop cramming numbers down our throats when our backrooms look like a natural disaster and the store cannot take more.

You are losing a lot of undervalued, overworked and underpaid people sacrificing family, relationships, goals and aspirations to get by not getting written up for first world mistakes.

Unless you address some of the assertions explained here, Mondelez international will continue to be a revolving door of disgruntled employees who find better paying jobs that don't suck the life out of them physically and mentally.

","For Merchandisers or Sales Service Reps, the hours aren't the greatest. You work most if not all weekends. Occasionally, it's hard to get hours during the week. Work can be very repetitive. Training can be hard to come by. Communication can be hard at times, as it's all over the phone. Sometimes it's hard to get a hold of upper management. Sometimes, expectations, especially during holidays are unrealistic. Pay is a little higher than most for merchandisers. Reimbursement for gas mileage however, is pretty low. Lots of wear and tear on your vehicle over time.
Advice to Management
Improve rates for gas mileage reimbursement. Make sure all the territories have more than enough people to cover.

Company car. Free cookies and crackers.
Good amount of PTO.
","When I started with Nabisco they were owned by Kraft. I really enjoyed the job then. There was a lot of flexibility to allow for some work life balance. In 2013 they spun off from Kraft to become their own company Mondelez, based in Canada with brands like cadbury, sour patch, halls and trident. Almost immediately they started taking things away. First it was the announcement that we all were loosing our annual bonuses, then they took a week of PTO away from every rep(can you believe that?). Then the one thing that was great, the company car, was downgrade from a nice ford Fusion to a tin can Cruze or Ford focus. 
But it didn't stop there. The sales objectives got so high that most reps could not make bonus. Mondelez is setting the sales projection high just to please the stock holders and we are left holding the bag. The latest cost move they employed is to ad 5 stores to all reps and demote reps that don't live in their territory to full time merchandisers. The morale between reps has never been so low in my time with the company. I expect a large exodus of sales reps. Many reps have lost routes they had serviced for 10+ years and moved to low performing routes with no chance of making a bonus. Without bonus, the job is not worth all the hard work and I mean hard work. Base salary will range from 36,000 to 40,000 depending on qualifications. Nabisco faces some serious challenges ahead. The world is eating better and lets face it, their products are on most parents do not buy list. They are trying to get creative to secure the lost revenue. Cutting employee cost is at the top of their list. I would not think of this as a growing company as a perspective new hire, but a shrinking one.

Fri Sep 25 2015,N/A,, ,"Stressful, Demanding & Micromanaging",3,"I have been merchandising for several years and in all types of fields. ( Gift Cards, Grocery Resets, Electronics, Hardware Stores & more ) 

I'm young & fit as well but I have to say expect this to be one of the most demanding jobs and stressful you probably will come by.

You must be there around 5 AM on delivery days which are Mon, Wed & Fri and if you are not there on the exact dot of time the stores will call your boss and complain on you like they are literally dying and having a panic attack because someone is not there to put out crackers. yes it happened when I first started a few times I hate to admit. 

Every manager is different I'm sure but the one I got is a major micro manager to the extreme!! Now my manager is a really nice person but still micro manages 24/7 even when you are not on the schedule or even working. They constantly send texts over and over telling you to do the most simple & mundane things that you probably already did way before they even texted you. Making it seem as you are mentally challenged.

They constantly demand you work better but also quicker because you are claiming to many hours, stores treat you like you are a complete utter useless, brain damaged and not worth living human being ( except Walmart ) 

Do you really want me to continue? Yes it's seriously that bad.

At this job you actually hope to have someone work with you because you really truly will need the help because it is so much to do! BUT when you do ask for help from your co workers they say the can't or even worst when you ask your manager they simply tell you N O 

And when your coworkers aren't telling you they can't help they are texting photos of your untrained work such as bad placement of items, damaged items, boxes stacked wrong on pallets, pallets not condensed correctly, pallets not shrink wrapped correctly ARE all being sent to your boss. Basically they are snitching on you BUT keep in mind no one taught you how to do any of the above mentioned stuff and you really had to learn from your mistakes or you would not last here for long.

Another thing is the scheduling, you get your weekly log of work to do usually about a week ahead of time so you can plan out your week of off days and days you are working and even which stores you are going to go to! Sounds great right? Well it would be if that's how it actually happens. What always happens is you get a text from your boss around 8 or 9 the night before and they tell you where you need to go and it never ever matches the schedule. So let's say you was only supposed to work 1 store so you might plan something that day for yourself or family but then out of nowhere they have you working 3 and the days your supposed to work 3 they change it up on you the last minute and your only working one. Happens literally every single day. 

You are allowed to take lunches on your own time but more then once as soon as I went on lunch, got some food and was putting the fork to my mouth to eat my phone literally starting ringing and my boss is on the other end screaming asking where am I because the store complained I left OR my boss is at the store doing a check up on me. 

It's a true nightmare majority of the time
","Everything I mentioned above, you get paid between $10-$12 dollars and its really not to much worth it unless you really don't have anything better

My co-workers were amazing. Company car with personal and business gas paid for. If sales and manual labor is your thing, and you have no plans on doing anything else with your career, this job is perfect.
","Not really a sales job, it's mostly physical labor. This goes for Senior Sales Service Reps and Sales Reps too. Broken promises by management. They want Sales Reps to have college degrees, so they recruit from universities and give so much hope that you can make it to corporate, they will help you out along the way. In reality, there is little possibility of moving up unless you want to stick with it at the retail level for a decade or more. Low morale. Unrealistic sales goals. Management was a disorganized mess. Grocery managers can be rude and very difficult to work with. Merchandising help is not always up-to-par, so you're just doing more work to fix what is wrong. Also not enough merchandising help. Company is still restructuring, so budgets are being cut, jobs are being cut, and there is less mobility. Zero work/life balance. You are always on call, even on weekends when something goes wrong, you have to send out notes every night, and work with many merchandisers who don't have accountability for a territory of stores, so they call out sick or can't work at a certain time and leave you scrambling.

","Some functional areas are significantly understaffed and the existing staff are working long hours to get their jobs done. Additionally, many administrative functions have been outsourced to 3rd party companies and/or moved to offshore locations where communication skills of the staff are extremely poor and where these offshore staff work off a script that they cannot deviate from. In addition, the people in these offshore locations are not nearly as knowledgeable or competent as the onshore staff. Hence, numerous calls to these offshore locations must be made before a problem is resolved. Accounts Payable, is probably the weakest area with the lowest customer service satisfaction rate for both the staff of Mondelez and for vendors trying to figure out why invoices are not being paid.

","Where do I begin..under Cadbury the workforce was small but well compensated and the growth and innovation fostered a profitable company with a friendly work environment. Kraft came along and slowed the company down immensely. At first, they added a whole bunch of make-work jobs, mostly in the backoffice when they downgraded to an older version of SAP. Flash forward to today and nearly everyone I started with has either been cut or has found better jobs elsewhere. 

During my time in Research I've seen project after project killed due to cost and only the ones which promoted cost cutting with cheaper (usually Chinese) ingredients move forward. Meanwhile, the smaller (usually private) competitors climb further and further ahead since they try to answer the customers needs/wants and actually roll out fun new products.

Meanwhile the Zero Based Budgeting and the cost cutting mentality has created a culture of fear where no one dares to speak up for fear of losing their jobs in the next round of firing. Some people even blatantly back stab and sabotage their coworkers in order to curry favor and protect themselves. No workplace is perfect but between the lack of emphasis on growth and the relentless costcutting I don't see the company lasting more than a few years before being bought out by someone more competent.

If you want Mondelez to be a ""Great Place to Work"" (which is a motto of yours) then you should treat your people better. You had a long and drawn out process of layoffs in 2014. You had people worry for nearly 9 months about whether they were on the ""list"" before finally dropping the axe on them. You even had the nerve to deliver the news to people on the same day that you had your fall celebration day festival in Deerfield. While some people were eating brats and drinking beer, others were being told they no longer had a job. Very cruel and inconsiderate to say the least. You also condone abusive behavior by managers. There is little to no growth opportunity whatsoever. You work your people extremely hard during your tough times and then as soon as things slow down and are under control, you start trying to outsource their jobs as fast as you can. In nutshell, you just don't care for your people. Senior mangers just look to axe people all the time to get a fatter bonus and a promotion. Sad, so sad how you treat the people that made you what your are today.

","Where do I begin.....
Most of the good Finance people are gone.
IT managers and above boast about who they can cut to save their own hide
IT in East Hanover will continue to help ruin the company. They should close it down. The only thing they are good at is pretending that they know how to lead.
People do not get cut because of performance; it is all based on ""who you know"".
The company paid a fortune for Accenture to implement zero based budgeting which was actually already being done. Accenture consultants were terrible but they helped cut Mondelez jobs to cover their cost. 
Most are confused at how Irene Rosenfeld got a huge pay increase in 2014 when everyone else got jack for bonus and the company did not reach targets. In fact, no one understands why she still has her job. This goes to show how messed up the company is. They try to get 2 jobs out of a lot of people with no reward in the end. If your job is cut or you quit, you are the lucky one since you get to move on and work for a progressive growing company with better products. The company will get sold or merged soon.

Sun Apr 05 2015,Anonymous,"East Hanover, NJ",Current Employee ,Comfortable but few Opportunities for Growth,6,"Mondelez is a very comfortable place to work. The IS department has done an incredible job making work/life balance easy for employees. As long as you have an internet connection, you can work from anywhere in the world. Many white collar colleagues work from home every Friday, and some only step foot in the office 1-2x a month. Some even ""work"" from their vacations to skirt the limits on PTO days. That's not to say it's easy work; many colleagues are expected to do the same work that was managed by two or three different roles prior to the Kraft split. Night and weekend work is almost a given during most projects. Pay is extremely high because the corporate locations are usually an hour or more from major urban centers which hurts recruiting. Benefits are good but have been reduced substantially in recent years (pensions are no longer available to new employees; healthcare plans have gone to high deductible models; the 401k matching has been reduced.) So, you get a decent work/life balance thanks to the mobility options, nice benefits, and a high-paying job, but in general one should expect there to be much in the way of growth opportunity beyond that. It's a good place to be comfortable, which is great for the right kind of person.
","The company is almost constantly embarking on an organizational restructuring in some form or fashion. That means that annually colleagues are laid off and those who remain must pick up the slack. With the recent focus on cost control, there are very few job openings in many of the white collar departments, and often the openings that do come up are filled from outside the company. There are very few advancement opportunities into management and many people find themselves in specialist positions without clear career progression. This tends to drag down morale and most people seem content to do their assigned jobs and get out of the office as quickly as possible most days. It is hard to say there is really a culture at Mondelez; something is just missing.
Advice to Management
The ""top down"" mandates (particularly in regards to organizational design) seem to run counter to the ""open and inclusive"" value for Mondelez. Rather than deciding the career futures of employees in metaphorical smoke-filled rooms, HR and senior management should make an actual effort to know the wants and needs of the people they lead.

Fri Nov 07 2014,N/A,"East Hanover, NJ","Brand Management in East Hanover, NJ",Not always as happy as the brands they manage,3,"Mondelez certainly wants to try new things and has had some great marketing around its brands because of their willingness to work with agency partners and push forward. They allow employees to move around to different departments if they can prove a genuine interest (and get the necessary graduate education for certain roles). It's definitely a good name for the resume. Fun brands to work on. Work life balance is okay (not the best in the industry but certainly not the worst).
","Some teams are great to be part of while others leave quite a lot to be desired. People are promoted because it's time rather than because they have the skills; this is particularly a problem when it comes to managing others. There are some people who truly understand the business but do not know how to manage a team yet they are managing teams and brands because they've been working for a certain number of years. The worst manager I've worked for was at Mondelez. She clearly did not know how to motivate others or foster collaboration, but in all fairness I do not believe that Mondelez ever trained her to be a good manager. There's also quite a bit of internal competition that is more about schmoozing than who is the most qualified (though this is typical of larger organizations). Along those lines, while having Mondelez on a resume shows others you're a good worker, they also assume you're cutthroat because that's the culture Mondelez portrays. 

I often noticed a disconnect between my direct manager and her manager, which made it hard to do my job since they were not communicating effectively. It was to the point where I felt I should ask my manager's manager before going forward with a task because her opinion mattered more. Unfortunately I wasn't the only person who felt this way - several others in the organization saw this same disconnect within their teams making it hard to truly collaborate and understand the goals they were aiming for.

Finally, there's a lot of pressure internally to cut those margins and change downward trends. This can be kind of wearing on people and (while very important) should not be the end all be all of the company.
Advice to Management
Don't simply train people how to do a task, but train your employees how to be effective leaders. Understand that some people (no matter how business savvy) should not lead others. Also don't allow for misalignment of goals within a single team! Focus perhaps on more open communication within teams to have thorough dialogues to clear up any issues. Lastly, know what pressures do and do not need to make their way all the way down the chain.

Also have expresso coffee machines--free coffee always. We had on-site help desk for any IT issues, and ergonomic seating, good lighting. Close free parking, great cafeteria, I was a contractor, but thought management treated everyone with respect. We had many parties, celebrations, and lunch-time educational sessions always included a free lunch. Mondelez is a very generous company (offshoot of Kraft Foods)
","People are so busy that they did not leave the building very often. Also the open seating is good but sometimes it gets so noisy that it is difficult to hear if you are in a meeting. Not too many cons!
Advice to Management
It was hard to be a contractor and know I would be leaving because I made great friends. I think you lose some great hard-working potential employees by using so many contract positions. I wanted to stay so badly and they did pay me well.
