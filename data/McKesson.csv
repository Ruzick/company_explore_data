","Sales numbers were top month over month until kids daycare closed due to COVID and I had to be a full-time father as well as sales rep. Due to that my numbers went down. I chose my children over my job and was not able to make calls. My manager knew everything that was going on I was very transparent. He even saw first hand on Zoom what I had to deal with with a 1 yr & 3yr old babies. He cared but HIS manager did not care. I dealt with depression, anxiety and other mental issues. I communicated that to my manager as well. But instead of empathizing with me, They fired me and even denied my unemployment during a pandemic with a family. I’ve only They didn’t even pay me enough to hire a nanny because the bonus and commission structure is not lucrative at all. I got in sales to make money. You won’t get that here. Maybe on the management team. But I’m always optimistic and believe everything happens for a reason. As a God fearing man, I am now in my dream job with a company that truly cares for their people. My base salary is almost double of what McKesson offered me and my commission and bonus structure is extremely lucrative. So in conclusion, use McKesson as a stepping stone for what you truly want to do. Whether it’s at McKesson or another company. If the role is not in your heart or you don’t have a passion, get out ASAP. They will cut you and throw you away like trash.
Advice to Management
Stop treating people like trash. Stop playing favorites. Tell people up front that the commission and bonus sucks. Don’t make it so complex that they don’t truly know how they get paid or can’t even set a goal of what they want to get paid. Make it simple and easy to understand.

","401k match is cut, salary increases are cut, bonuses are being cut, budgets are being cut across the board. Entire company seems to be in a leadership free fall, and entire IT divisions are getting outsourced, or ""consolidated"" 

The culture is quickly becoming toxic with leaders building castles to keep their turf. 

Divisions are being outsourced, and budgets have been slashed with little communication as to the why. Good leaders are getting fired because they don't kiss the ring, and I see many more cronies coming in soon. This place will be a different company in 2-5 years, and the leaders are actively making sure it will be be hell getting there.

","This is only specific to USON: Really horrible middle management. Manipulating and twisting ILEAD and ICARE principles towards self-gratification And abuse from middle management. These are the following examples from mgmt: 1. Was told that I was “incompetent” and “ignorant” under guise of “Open and Candid”. 2. Was also told even high school students are more advanced with technology compared to some on team. 3. Was told that I can be replaced at any time with cheaper more technical people due to unemployment surge during COVID for motivational purposes. 4. Had to work weekends and evenings on a constant basis. 5. JIRA tickets for Agile not implemented correctly. Tickets with same # moved forcefully into following sprint with newly added requirements to ensure my efforts will never see light of day. 6. New middle management brought in who looked great on paper and pretty much with little skills towards actual direction and implementation. 7. SQL scripts written in “5 mins” causing job failures downstream. 8. Management refuse to take advice for positive changes. 9. Lack of data architecting/data engineering knowledge from micro managers. Sad really. 10. Mgmt does not act professional while on business travel. Leans towards harassment.

","Supervisors are absolutely subpar. Their obsession with the ""rate"" (processing as many orders as possible) is absurd. They are out of touch with the people doing the work. They sit in their office and only come out when they want to push more orders out resulting in lots of overtime. Many temp employees burn out and quit because of how boring and repetitive the job is. Most of the people at Central Fill Buffalo don't want to be there. They either have nothing else or are trying to get out. I could go on but to sum up: please avoid Central Fill Buffalo. They say that they want this to be a fun place that people enjoy working for but it's the exact opposite.
Advice to Management
Clean house. Hire new supervisors who know how to properly manage a building. They need management that cares about their employees wellbeing. They need supervisors who don't push their employees to benefit the company and offer no benefit (or inadequate benefit) to the employee. Better supervisors are sorely needed.

The environment there is so stressful management likes to bark orders while they sit in their office. A couple supervisors there were so unprofessional and some didn't know what the heck they were doing. They cut cost on a lot of things and in doing so the employees suffer if they upgraded what they needed too everything would run soo much smoother and make things so much easier but of course upper management like those bonuses they would rather have money in their pocket then worry about employees under them. They constantly blow smoke up your butt then wonder why they have such a high turn over rate. So no I would not recommend anyone to apply at mckesson if you want to be over worked, under paid, and under valued then thats the place for you if I could give them zero stars i would.

Honestly, Fire the bottom 20-25%% of employees here and IMMEDIATELY redistribute their pay to the 75-80%. There are some people here who are satisfied with the $12, have no desire to grow the business, and they need to go. Forget Masters and River City separately and re-brand as MDC so we can all take care of each others accounts. Bring some ICARE principles to this location. There is zero accountability in other departments, AR here is a joke and customers can never pay their bill or get info regarding their account.

","McKesson is an example of too big to fail. It lumbers along with a substantially mismanaged group of leadership. Layoffs have happened and I suspect will happen again soon... give it six months. Lots of poor management and no one wants to speak up for fear of retribution... because everyone is someone's buddy. Pretty sad because the business could be so much more streamlined and successful. Its own competition is itself. Just look at the resumes of those working there. Everyone who has a 'senior' title just simply jumped around every 12-18 months... never becoming an expert in their function. This has lead to many of the wrong people in the wrong seat. If you are looking for a company to work for and are inspired by the prospect of your success being based on your ability to be someone's buddy, you may do well at McKesson. If you are actually talented and motivated to do well, please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. It's a sad, sad place to work. Thus why I threw in the towel after 5+ years. Life is too short to work for the midlevel management at McKesson.
Advice to Management
Half of the management needs to quit. Way too many people who have moved up because of the buddy system. It does not do good by the company. Morale is low. Lots of people voluntarily quit... I did... even after many years with them. Rewards seriously lack, improve that. Stop patting yourself on the back for great employee surveys. They are only good because you lean on staff to give good ratings. It actually does not do any good for the company, only your ego. If only shareholders knew.

Thu Mar 14 2019, Analyst,"Irving, TX",Current Employee ,Great Opportunities--you get out what you put in,6,"Overall, McKesson is a great company to work for if you're willing to work hard (and roll with the punches/be adapatable). As such a large company, there are virtually endless opportunities to expand your skillset (through both new roles and free training), but you have to put forth the effort to find/complete them. Their benefits, PTO, work from home, and work/life balance are generally great. There are lots of good people at the company, and lots of opportunities to network, collaborate, and try different kinds of roles. McKesson generally rewards employees who work hard, which is why so many people stay with the company for long periods of time/the life of their career. With any large company there will always be politics, but generally speaking, people who work hard (and network) do not have trouble getting promotions.
","There is definitely a divide between those who hustle and those who 'coast'. The people who take advantage of learning/development opportunities are generally the hard workers/people who will move up at the company--however, there are still a large number of people (usually who have been with the company for 15+ years) who are content to do the bare minimum to keep their jobs. Those people exist both at the lower levels as well as in management--not all managers are willing to help their employees develop if it requires more effort than just a monthly check in. If you're under a bad manager, you can feel undervalued/overworked, while other people on the team seemingly do nothing all day and are compensated better because they have been with the company for a long time. In these situations, the only way out is to change roles/teams (which thankfully, McKesson has lots of opportunity to do). This leads to a 'brain drain' effect in the same departments over and over again, where long-time employees who consistently do not meet metrics stay with the department for years, while the 'new recruits' come in, work extremely hard, become disenchanted because they are overworked/underpaid, and leave the team as soon as they hit the 1 year mark and have the ability to apply out within the company.

As the pharmaceutical industry grows and changes, McKesson has felt the pinch to cut costs as much as anyone. In some instances, that has led to senior management making sweeping changes to cut costs (while they adamantly deny it is cost-related) without thinking through the feasibility/impact on employees' day to day ability to do their work (for example, moving to flexible/non-assigned workspaces for the entire campus, regardless of whether or not some teams never work from home and need a desk every day to do their jobs).
Advice to Management
McKesson likes to say that we run lean. However, the hesitancy to let go of employees who underperform (but have a longstanding tenure) leads to the same teams/departments not meeting goals time and time again (ie the constantly sinking ship). Reward/recognize high performing employees in their current roles, rather than letting them leave because they receive no recognition. I would also recommend looking at candidates with an interest in developing themselves when hiring, rather than someone with 10 years of experience who has no interest in expanding their skillset. As more and more roles are moved offshore or automated, the former will make a better long term employee.

Also, before making sweeping changes, engage more with lower management (the director level) and LISTEN to their feedback. The flexible workspace idea is not inherently bad--if it had been done more strategically, targeting the teams/departments that work from home 3 days a week already, rather than axing the productivity for every team who is in the office everyday, it could work. But unilateral changes affect different teams differently. Had senior management engaged with the lower management/employees, it would have been extremely obvious that this change would not lead to better utilization of space/equal productivity levels across the entire campus.

- High Turn over... shows when recruiters post “ looking to hire several security analyst positions”.

- Leadership will feed you the right lines early on to get you to buy into the vision. 
- Team has no direction of where they are going.
- Always pass of blame to someone else.
- Complete disregard from leadership. 
- Claim to support diversity, actions show otherwise not allowing certain people to conduct the technical work they desire instead treating them like a secretary (scheduling meetings)

I've seen them have pictures taken of an employee after the employee filed a discrimination and harassment complaint and tried to find ways to get rid of the employee.

","Extensive changes in the last year have caused instability, confusion and low morale. New management exhibits very poor leadership and provides little, if any, direction to subordinates, but have very high expectations and micro-manage to drive results. If you question their decisions or show concern, you will be skapegoated or blamed for the problem(s) and suddenly told you have poor performance and/or put on a PIP, then turn to bullying you to get you to leave or simply let you go. This is happening to very bright, hard-working, productive and caring individuals. It has been tragic to see this. HR will do nothing. If upper management finds out you have contacted HR, they will reprimand you. A few people do all the work, while others take the credit. No work/life balance. Very silo’d organization with duplication of roles and data (data is a mess with disparate systems across the enterprise), with no documented processes and procedures to navigate or understand who does what and how to get what you need. Spend a lot of time talking and in meetings, but little “doing”. Medical insurance cost very high.
Advice to Management
Take a good, hard, long look at the people you have in leadership roles at Director level and above, particularly in Marketing. Conduct anonymous surveys or focus groups, so employees can speak freely and openly to share their concerns. Current performance surveys show management what answers were to employee surveys and questions too generic. Retrain upper management on how to lead and treat subordinates, especially if an issue arises involving a complaint to HR. There should be a zero tolerance policy for reprimanding an employee for contacting HR. Require stringent guidelines to suddenly accuse someone of poor performance. If iCare and iLead are so important, enforce them with your leadership and management team. Right now they are accusing people below them of not fulfilling these tenets, but they are actually not following them. Streamline the organization and centralize roles/responsibilities to avoid silos and duplication. Put a priority on getting data organized, cleaned up and put in one place. Overhaul your insurance program. It should cost less for a company of McKesson’s size and type.

Tue Mar 27 2018, Warehouse Associate,,Current Employee ,Attendance policy is not for people with families,9,"Personally I like the job itself, but if you are stuck in the same area for too long due to lock of training b in other areas the time doesn't move.
","Well I'm going to be completely honest here they work by an attendance point system policy and because of that the turnover rate is very high. You get four sick days and once those are gone you rack up points against you that don't go away till one year after you recieved them. Once you get to 8 you are terminated. I have seen good employees let go because of it and others who aren't very good but just show up have remained employed creating a longer work day for everyone. You will recieve multiple points for one day if you are out of sick time and can be terminated for missing 7-8 days in a one year period. They aren't very clear about the point system even if you have asked about it multiple times. You get vacation time but it can not be used whenever you want it or in emergency call of situations to avoid points it must be scheduled in advance.
Advice to Management
We are expected to put the company before our own families and its not right. The 8 point system needs to be revised and its not ideal for people who actually need the job such as those with families. It also seems as they pick and choose who to give points to since some people definately should be gone from absences but are the supervisors pets while others have had emergency situations and have been let go for just a few days of absences. I'm sad to say I will probably not be with the company much longer even though I have happily showed up to work and have given my all going home at the end of the night barely able to walk and sore have maintained a very good DPMO and also higher rate but due to two unplanned emergency situations and one day that a winter weather advisory warned people not to drive due to high volume of accidents and unclear roads so I thought I was safe and used a sick day for that day. It was the day after the superbowl which the day of the superbowl we worked till 5:30am well after the commotion of the game and potatoes have ended our home teams also were not playing so there was no reason to celebrate. I live any hour away from the job which I happily drive every day. I am now on a final and can be sick or one minute late for 10 months till points fall off which for someone who has a larger family is impossible. I really loved working for the company and will be sad to go when my time comes although I will try to hold on things happen that are out of our control. I just wish there was more faith put in us, most of us would be there every day if we could.

You can take advantage of some great educational benefits if you are willing to put in the work and the time.
","Very obvious and large distinction in salary and opportunities for those who came in with an MBA at a higher level vs. those who worked their way up. Very obvious and low hanging glass ceilings. Many layoffs every season in different departments (to be clear I was not laid off but watched it happen often). Very limited raises and promotions due to ""monetary constraints"" even with perfect reviews and having made use of developmental resources. It is hard to see in the news how much the CEO and other higher-ups' salaries are increasing when no one in your building is even getting a raise and/or is getting laid off. Not very diverse or women forward. Healthcare insurance costs increase exponentially every year.

","The management team SUCKS. If time. Only favorites get everything and anything. Most of the time they are managers’ pets and they don’t have to work. Very disturbing because people who have been there for a long time have to sit and take calls for 8 hours. Favorites take breaks whenever they want. Favorites usually take group breaks and they don’t have to be ontime because managers approve those “special breaks”. McKesson doesn’t provide bonus checks for Christmas like other companies do. McKesson used to give gift cards for Christmas to employees for only $50.00 but quit doing that too as of December 2017. Also, very greedy with annual raises. Customer service representatives get raise between 10 and 25 cents once a year. McKesson corporation is a joke.

","1) Management doesn't value employees. Especially senior management. Rare to give (meaningful) Kudos, they come and go so often the company path looks like that of a sailboat heading into the wind (tacking back and forth). Almost no reason to learn the name of your VP, by the time you get to know them they move on (and leave their mess in their wake (how about that, two sailing references in one review - a sign!).
2) No job stability. I've been @ McKesson for a long time but there are constant huge lay-offs that have nothing to do with job performance. At the same time, have a look at our CEOs salary. Now that he's getting a big fat tax cut (along with the company) it would be great to see him reduce his salary and stop laying us off 2x/year.
3) It is pretty much impossible to change positions. Whatever you are hired on as you remain (forever). You can climb the management ladder if you're located in the (current) correct place but first level managers are highest risk with their jobs IMO. Very dangerous (and the job sucks).
Advice to Management

Hard to get fired from unless a really crappy worker. Opportunity to be promoted if willing to relocate out of state. Good place to get a lot of learning in short period of time. Recommend to be only two years 4 max and leave with the experience if not promoted right away . Overtime only in warehouse.
","Where to start. If you like to do way to much in one shift and be overwhelmed this is the place for u. Benefits are horrible and every year get more expensive and higher deductibles. Individual max is 6000 a year. Micromanaging place. If your new to the company they will pay you the same as a ten+ year employee working thier butts off. Only plan to work here for two years for experience. If not promoted by then, expect to never be promoted. No work life balance. Shift hours change when managers change .

Pay employees correctly not to save the pocket change and use it to bring in new people that don’t work as hard as ones dedicated to the overall company expectations . Stop micromanaging your good employees that know what thier jobs are and complete them and others as well. Remove the lazy employees that refuse to do things the company needs done right. Stop making excuses for everyone else and be honest with employees . Find better benefits for employees. Working with healthcare should be able to provide better health Insurance then what is available now. Focus on the bad/ problem employees not the ones that actually get the job done.

Higher salary than a lot of other CO companies, decent benefits for the first 12 years I was there and good PTO policy. Match charitable donations and provide grants up to $1000/year based on employee volunteerism.
","A lot of management mis-steps and poor decisions in my division led to its downfall and eventual sale. Layoffs every 2 - 3 months, promotion of people that have no business being a director, manager or VP, no leadership engagement with day to day operations or visible to employees. Benefits went downhill, bonuses were cut out except for management, no internal training or advancement opportunites unless you were part of the ""in"" crowd, stock tanked and morale went downhill. No employee or team building events and overall just became a miserable place. Few people bother to go in the office anymore. The CEO recently was asked on an investor call about the low morale overall, not just our division. His response was employee morale is the responsibility of the employee. Says a lot about how he feels about the people that helped rebuild our division.

","Managers with the Breast Pump team play favorites and allow the favorites to do as they please without penalty. Decisions for the team are not well thought out, and made without any regard to how it may affect team members or clients alike. Of the 5 or 6 managers that work in that particular department, maybe only 2 step up to be around and help when needed. In the end, I had to leave since I didn't want to play into the popularity contest. HR has been notified multiple times (by multiple people) of the wrongful things going on and nothing has been done. Many people left or would like to leave because they feel as though by speaking up or saying anything remotely negative will rock the boat and cause terrible consequences for themselves. If you don't suck up to management, they make your every day at work a living hell... only to then gather at the end (or middle) of the work day to laugh about it and talk about anyone and everyone with your favorited peers.
