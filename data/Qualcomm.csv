It really was a great place to work while they had a large operation running here in Raleigh. They make sure their engineers all have a quiet place to work privately if they need to work by having offices and doors for most of their engineers above a certain level, yet also provide enough meeting rooms and common areas so that there is room for team discussions. It was a fun, great place to work, and a highlight of my career while I was there. The office building where I worked has been completely dismantled and no longer bears the Qualcomm logo.
","The only real downside is that if top management makes a poor business decision, which is something that every business faces from time to time, everyone suffers, but the bad stuff rolls downhill and the ones making the lousy decisions stay on, but thousands of others lose their jobs, which is what happened to my job and over a thousand others. That said, the company still took very good care of all of us and made sure we found work with a generous package, however, so Qualcomm really did show that they care about their people.

Recent reorg in IT has made work-life balance better, and the shift to a flexible work schedule seems to be permanent, which is awesome.

Decent benefits.
","Overall compensation is a bit below market rate for the region, though pay increases the past few years have been well above average, maybe a result of the company settling the lawsuit with Apple and prevailing over the FTC.

The large scale of the company and it's monolithic structure can be frustrating at times to deal with. Sometimes difficult to find out who is in charge of what. Work sometimes gets bogged down as there can be many groups that require approval to implement. Large size of teams sometimes allow situations where certain employees can get away with doing bare-minimum work while others pick up the burden. The term ""rest-and-vest"" is used derisively here, and many employees are just waiting to retire.

","Talent isn’t appreciated in this company at all. It’s a very political place, with a lot of political power given to directors of groups. So if your director is good, you can get better salary, better bonuses and timely promotions.

If you are in remote site (not in SD that is), good luck with finding opportunities for career growth within the company. Utterly disgraceful management, with loads of VPs reporting each other, who do nothing valuable for growth of this company. Upper management doesn’t really care for even basic needs of engineers (like monumental pay increase, creating work-friendly environment).

","Communication and Vision from senior leadership in the engineering organization is severely lacking.
The tools and processes engineers must deal with on a daily basis are a source of frustration.
Legal woes have been a constant overhang on employee morale (and compensation) for the last several years... and it seems it's still not finished.
Management is clumsily re-learning how to show their appreciation for employees by inviting thousands of employees to a launch party on one of the campuses where we get to wait in horribly long lines just to get a free taco and a beer. Employee appreciation is nothing like what it used to be.
HR keeps fiddling with the performance review process and rating system, yet at the end of it all the rating system and forced curve-fitting ends up destroying employee morale even further.

Management treats marketing as a disposable asset. Product management has the ability to directly comment and influence the careers of everyone in marketing yet marketing is given no ability to provide similar feedback on product management individuals in the review cycle. There is also very limited upward mobility in marketing, making working there a constant pressure cooker environment. That plus having to deal with a perpetual budgeting process makes marketing at Qualcomm a high-stress, low rewarding job. Because Qualcomm pays extremely well, it becomes extremely hard for anyone in marketing to challenge product management or take real control of the marketing process, which becomes dictated to marketing by product management. Marketing is, in effect, treated as a second class citizen within the org, and this is highlighted by the fact that the company has had a dozen different people managing marketing over the last decade. It's like the company doesn't really know what to do with the department which impacts the moral and enthusiasm of many of the people working there.

So much to learn working here. Salaries are generally competitive (but changing). Depending on your manager, you can have flexibility in your work hours. On-site health care is convenient and high quality.
","Benefits shrinking rapidly — no more accrued vacation time. Also, with repeated layoffs and understaffed departments, it’s near Impossible to find a time “convenient to the business” to take any time off. Headcount is cut in half in some areas while workload only grows, and there is no concern for employee welfare and how to resolve tired over-worked employees having unrealistic workload to manage. New merit review system removes manager ability to individually reward high performers (it is all decided by compensation team). High performers are given minuscule salary increases below cost of living increase; how does this
motivate anyone? No end in sight to mountains of work growing with no plans to add resources, only more reductions.
Advice to Management
Stop killing your staff with unrealistic amounts of work with little reward. If you don’t take care of people they will keep leaving. Make people take mandatory vacation time for their own mental health, it is shown to increase productivity. Also give bigger raises and bonuses to keep them— it is cheaper than what you lose when they quit and you need to find, hire, and train new people.

","When I started at Qualcomm, they were on the Forbes Top 100 Companies to work for list. They haven't been back since, and it's clear why: they stopped treating their employees as a valuable asset, and instead seem to be treating them as expendable assets. I've watched almost half my team go to other companies, but no one in management seems to be panicking like they should be.

Qualcomm seems to have no common processes, nor the flexibility to let small groups decide their own processes. ""Agile"" and ""Scrum"" are words that are used without any of the actual benefits of those processes. The inefficiency in my group alone is staggering, and proposing improvements gets opposition from the 10+ year veterans who think they're still working at a scrappy startup company. 

Which leads to the other thing: Qualcomm is an enormous company with tons of revenue, but there are still, for some reason, pockets of the company (or maybe it's universal, for all I know) that act like it's a startup where everyone needs to put in ridiculous hours all the time. If Qualcomm can't meet their deadlines with people working normal hours, then that's a management issue, not employees not working hard enough. There are times when long hours over a short, pre-determined period can result in huge efficiency gains, and that can be worth it. But when it's considered a negative on your performance review that you're unavailable on weekends, while the rest of your work is stellar... well, it makes sense that people (those who could) would try to find a more sane work environment.

It's spirit of innovation upon which it was founded still resides with many of the employees, especially at headquarters. It continues to be the leader in mobile technologies--modems and connectivity like 3G, 4G and the coming 5G. Qualcomm treats its employees very well and is generous in terms of salary and benefits.
","The company is in a bit of turmoil due to the on-going external attacks regarding its Licensing business, which delivers the lion's share of the company's profitability. In addition, te on-going delay in the acquisition of NXP, which was to help the company expand its footprint and TAM, has slowed the company's momentum. Note that the delay was due not to the company's short-comings, but by international politics, as China is the one remaining region to approve the acquisition. This challenge, combined with the on-going lawsuits over its licensing practices with Qualcomm's leading customer, Apple, has blended into a difficult, perfect storm for the management team.

Wed Jun 27 2018,Anonymous,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Avoid This Sinking Ship,6,"1. Pay is above average for the area & benefits are comprehensive.
","1. Incredibly political atmosphere fosters hostility and resentment among employees. Many of the ""Qualcomm lifers"" are there to ""rest and vest"" and are incredibly resentful of newcomers.
2. Extremely top heavy company with excessive amounts of upper management who expect the few non-management employees to do all of their work for them with no assistance, or guidance. Many Managers, Directors and VPs have no direct reports, and many departments have more management-level employees than not.
3. The company panders to the short-term whims of their investors, at the long-term cost of the company. One only needs to look at the on-going ""cost reduction initiative"" to save $1 billion to realize this. The company announced the initiative a few days before being slapped with around $1 billion in regulatory fines. Instead of adjusting their business model to prevent even further regulatory damages (QC has been slapped with major fines by Korea, China, and the EU to name a few), they insist on continuing with their controversial business model and instead choose layoff thousands of employees once more. Additionally, as part of the initiative there are no opportunities for internal transfers resulting in a mass exodus of much of the company's young, top talent.

The bottom line: I had high hopes for this company when I first started. Unfortunately, Qualcomm is a sinking ship. It's only a matter of time before all of their top young talent leave for another company that will do right by it's employees and investors, a company with a sustainable vision for the future, in addition to equitable pay.

","Executive management is not great, planning is done so poorly that they will severely under staff SoC projects and engineers will work round the clock most of the time including most weekends to try to make deadlines. There is a significant need for process improvement as one team works on one block and there is little communication or overlap so there are so many issues. They just let go of a lot of the people that were trying to fix this issue so it is not going to improve. This last round(s) of lay offs were not low performers as they have been in past. There were a very high number of people who were recently promoted and or I know were getting 6/7's ie outstanding reviews and high performers and were working weekends and all hours like most of us. It was a wake up call that performance or even how much your job is needed has no impact that you can be cut to make wall street and executives happy - so the loyalty factor myself and other team members who know we can easily get other jobs have stayed but a lot of people if they are not on visas or other significant reason to stay are looking. It used to be a great place to work but last few years sicne Steve took his 96 million or some added stock bonus on top of his existing stock and bonus's when we were all told that ear that stock grants and bonus's would be lower and we had lay offs things have gone down hill fast. We always worked hard but now they expectation is to work much harder for fewer raises/lower bonus. There is no longer any worklife balance and everyone is stressed and people who are not complainers are starting to complain this year they cant possibly get done what has been assigned so its constant stress. I know 2 people who were asked to take a demotion and pay cut to save their job (not due to performance again these are high performers) they both asked their director and Sr director respectively if they were taking a demotion or pay cut the answer was no - then how can you ask your staff to!!!! I feel for new people coming in as moral is at an all time low

Qualcomm has become progressively more bloated and allergic to innovation over the last several years. This weakness has become apparent with recent events, like the Broadcom takeover attempt. Management needs to begin thinking aggressively about which products and employees deliver the most value and focus on that.

The idea that you can continue to compete with the existing baseline of hardware and software, which is increasingly expensive to extend and commercialize, is a joke. New companies starting from scratch will make smaller HW and SW that can be extended easily going forward, so either compete with those people or stop trying.

Tue Feb 13 2018, Senior Engineer,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Qualcomm needs much more than just re-branding!,1,"-Decent work-life balance in some teams

- its all about ""who knows who"" and competing against people who work 12-18 hours a day
- not a progressive outlook
Advice to Management
- HR dept needs pruning. They basically serve at the pleasure of upper management than assisting engineers

Mon Mar 05 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Poor management,4,"Beautiful city San Diego. Free sodas. Multiple gyms and cafeterias. Corporate R&D used to have a lot of smart people back in the day.
","Corrupt and incompetent management at all levels from director all the way up to EVP and CEO. VPs looking out for their friends during the review process. HR seems to be hand in glove with VPs in helping out his or her friends. All interns seem to be family and friends of the VP or sr. dir.

Thu Feb 08 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Modem system test engineer,1,"Stressful environment make you learn very fast (yes, I like to work hard and learn fast.); 
Used have lots of exceptional lead can teach you not only in tech but also in how to do things in engineer way, especially those system team engineer before 2008. That's the best work experience I ever have.
Used have lots of access to design documents, if you are just graduated, this is a great book to understand how everything you learned in course can combine together.
Qualcomm benefits and salary is not that bad, if you just need and job to stay in US or have good quality life, it is a good choice.
","MST is not a high tech group since it is doing testing, so it is less chance for promotions and high chance when company needed to layoff some people. Especially company is focusing on delay people's promotion and testing jobs are transfer to Inida now, so be wise to make your choices. 
Performance review is pretty much not working, from my experience, hardworking year's rating is lower as I just finish my job (because I stay in current group longer in next review....), the rating is highly related to how long you been in your group. But, if you finish your job as the way your manger wanted and have strong technology. Maybe can be faster....
Since job is not hard to finish, so politic come into the working environment which make promotion and performance rate more confusing. 
Engineer minds is keep reducing in this group.
Under pay for sure and company's management team could tell you in department all-hands meeting that multiple finance model proved salary is competitive.
Since Qualcomm is under paying, talented people are leaving.

Tue Feb 27 2018, Senior Software Engineer,"San Jose, CA",Former Employee ,Come to this company if you are retiring next year,4,"Good benefits, good work life balance
","Work is boring. 
Nothing to learn after 6 month.
No respect to engineers. 
People get into groups and attack each other.
People get promoted based on who they know.
Smart engineers are leaving.
Meaningless meetings. 
There are managers doing all the design themselves and tell engineers get the things done and ask no question. Then they can use that pathetic information to exchange with other managers in those endless meetings and and gain ""visibility"" and quick promotions. 
Benefits and work life balance is good and you think above is not a problem. But it's the problem.
