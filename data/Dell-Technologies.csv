Thu Feb 04 2021, ISR,"Nashville, TN",Former Employee ,Progressive to a fault,0,"Great benefits including medical, dental, vacation. Company name has a good reputation in spite of changes. Some people at the company genuinely care about the culture and employees. If you are looking for an aggressive LBGTQ culture this is the place. Their stop/start/continue programs for managers are priceless opportunities for feedback- if they are still happening. Each year they do ""Tell Dell"" to get company wide feedback.
","Work life balance only applies to the senior levels of the company. People in the trenches are expected to work with some life on the side. The starting pay is frankly dismal and not easy to support a single individual let alone a family. Company has lowered the total possible amount to pay to employees consistently since early 2000s. Target revenue constantly increases while your customer set is limited, cut or reduced making over attainment a matter of luck. Some territories are a career death sentence. When you do over attain you must get moved or promoted because that high success rate becomes the new standard for the territory revenue going forward. 
The tools and metrics used by sales are top down forced into practice without concern if they actually work. Employees are as much pushed by making talk time and phone calls as you are revenue. 
Metrics and quotas are not connected to realities of pandemics or supply chain constraints. They are based on upper management meeting from the previous year without possible change of course.
Your opinion is only listened to if it agrees with the company direction- no matter how obvious a problem is - the middle and upper management only wants to hear agreement.
How to get promoted is to figure out who is in charge where you want to go and kiss the ring until they bring you on. You are either IN or not. Your numbers help but only have a small bearing on promotion.
Time in role is an excuse to not promote you- people frequently get promoted when they are liked no matter how short a time in role.
Don't expect to be promoted even if you get an offer- can't tell you how many people I know were trapped by ""headcount restrictions"" multiple times- including myself.
Dell pays lip service to promotion opportunities. Recent trends appear that Dell is forcing out veteran sales people and hiring in entry level. 
""Tell Dell"" is NOT anonymous no matter what they say- if you are negative you are better off not saying anything because there was a meeting where ""we want to know why this team scored the company so low on TD""- does that sound anonymous?

On another note: 
I don't agree that a corporation should be paying work time for employees to actively campaign on political agendas. Sending people on the clock to the legislature to promote a one sided agenda would alienate half the clients if they knew about it.
Advice to Management
Stop throttling pay- open the taps on bonus and spiff money.
Stop hiring off the street to senior level and management.
Start asking why when someone is past role minimum time and hasn't moved.
Continue offering work from home and generous benefits- it is literally the only differential factor that makes Dell a better place to work.
Recognize the ones brave enough to disagree with something- often they might have a genuinely beneficial insight that could save millions.

The company is amazing, but in this specific position the vast difference in pay between Account Exec and Account Manager can be demotivating at times. Both positions do a lot of the same work, have the same quotas, and are held just as responsible.

A little more pay equality would be great, and put some of us more at ease and create better working relationships with our account executives.

The company doesn't realize the value of their employees. Dell prides itself on shaving cost out of everything including their employees. Older more experienced people have been swapped out and replaced with a younger more diverse group. All of the inclusion means that someone had to be excluded. At the time of this review the Dell Career's page has a picture of 11 women and no men.

","Pay is terrible. Easily 10-15% lower than average in the area. Pay raise average is <2.5%.
After the storage products merge between Dell/EMC/Xtremio, the products went downhill due to internal politics. While the engineers from Dell & EMC worked together, the teams and management from Xtremio are impossible to deal with, no communication or collaboration. We have meetings between many scrum teams and they barely show up. Most of the promoted higher ups are from Xtremio so their teams are well protected, no consequences from their actions. After the product launch, they took all the credits to themselves and became the main project leaders while a bunch of Dell & EMC people got reassigned. Ridiculous.

Advice to Management
Don't be afraid to hold people accountable and terminate the counter-productive and cancerous individuals that hide under the comfort blanket of a world-wide brand that honestly embraces diversity. Lazy, apathetic, shirking, disrespectful people aren't protected by diversity but they will use it to bully the workplace. This isn't a misogynistic, racist or anything other than a human observation. People will use whatever advantage they have to stay relevant. ALL PEOPLE that possess good work ethics, are responsible, accountable and team players are VALUED over all else. Loyalty is important too. If all a person can do is speak disparagingly against their employer or the company they work for then why would that person want to continue to associate themselves with that same employer?
Diversity is an advantage not wielded with force but with respect for it's value. 
Of equal value are education, experience, leadership qualities, communication skills, any skill, any expert knowledge or ability acquired over the investment in time and practice. All to be weighed equally and in summation become the person. A diverse organization comes by recognizing those traits are common to all people irrespective of their sex or race. 
I use my 3 year enlistment in the Army 25 years ago and check the box indicating I'm a veteran - just in case it provides me an advantage. But I would never demand that I be hired or not be fired because of it. 
The workplace could be really amazing if people were just held accountable to their actions and behaviors. I suppose that goes in life as well.

Tue Nov 24 2020, Software Systems Engineer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Great work/life balance... but going woke,0,"Three weeks of vacation per year, plus the full week of Christmas off. They want your time outside of the work day to be YOUR time, so they generally respect the 8-5 or 9-5 time slot and don't expect you to be answering emails after-hours or on the weekend. They try to do lots of social events and maintain a healthy culture. Many people become friends outside of work. For new hires, there's lots of programs to help you engage with other young people and build friendships. They also have mentorship and other training programs so you can learn from leaders and other co-workers with more experience. Most people are very friendly and always willing to help.
","Because of COVID-19, they have suspended their 401k match program as well as their Inspire Recognition monetary rewards, at least for the time being. They also have not even let young, healthy people return to the office with masks and social distancing. Unless you're working directly on hardware, you're working remote. This makes it hard to build relationships, especially as a new hire. The worst part is the introduction of Critical Race Theory to multiple aspects of the company. They have a new required training course this year that pushes far left racial politics. They promote ""How to Be an Antiracist"" by Ibram X. Kendi in the course, and they expect you to acknowledge your ""white privilege"" and fight for the leftist social changes they prescribe. They are also working to revise all of their documents and code to get rid of ""racial/gender language."" Some examples of these words are blacklist, whitelist, man-power and rule of thumb. None of these are discriminatory, yet they expect you to change the English language to fit their political agenda. I do not think I could bring up any of these concerns with my manager without it having a severe effect on my career. This makes me worried about the future of the company.
Advice to Management
Reinstate the 401k match program. Reinstate the Inspire Recognition monetary awards. Allow young, healthy individuals to return to the office with masks and social distancing. Get rid of the required course ""Standing Strong Together: Confronting Racial Inequity,"" or at the very least, make it optional. Stop asking employees to change words in documents and code that the political left does not like. Create an environment where political conservatives feel welcome, and can be open about their beliefs. You don't have to agree with them, but forcing them to violate their religious and political beliefs through trainings and vocabulary changes is not acceptable.

You will be encouraged to expand your skills and to learn. Job responsibilities can change quickly, so be prepared to take advantage as windows open.
","Dell is a large organization in which groups within business orgs frequently encounter political pressures that require a lot of skill and will power as you navigate obstacles. For example, another team may view your work as countering their priorities and thus may rally support against your good work. If you work in a leading edge tech area you may see shifting sands and a may move from team to team quickly. This change frequently appears a bit disjoint. Don't get disheartened - press ahead!
Advice to Management
Please remember that people take great pride in their work may not appreciate being marginalized by changes you are making. Please take care of your more diligent and effective employees. A workforce reduction speaks louder than you might imagine, and will be contrasted with Dell's Culture and Values.

They are one of the few companies left that does 1:1 matches up to 6% for your 401k. The company is extremely open to remote work, and there are a lot of really great people working here. We are provided professional training every year, and before the pandemic, at least one major conference every year in addition to several smaller, local conferences. The work-life balance is amazing at Dell, and it's a HUGE reason people don't leave, especially those with families/young kids.
","Dell still stack-ranks employees, so inevitably people will get screwed, even if everyone on the team does an equal job. Dell also makes it very hard to get promoted to i9, which is basically the same as a Sr. level anywhere else. But i8s are also considered Sr. anywhere else, and there is a huge difference in the bonus % between i8 (8%) and i9 (15%). Also, Dell doesn't pass out RSUs to everyone like most of the other big tech companies do, so that's a big negative when you're in the tech space. The insurance isn't all that great -- it could definitely be worse, but for a company the size of Dell, you'd expect better insurance/pricing.
Advice to Management
Get rid of stack ranking. It's demoralizing. Stop being so stingy with promotions when i8s/i9s perform exactly the same in their day to day jobs. And start passing out RSUs to everyone, not just leadership! If you want people to really stay invested in their jobs and the company, make them feel valued with RSUs!

I worked at Dell Technologies full-time
Pros
Excellent non-cash benefits, socially responsible, diverse in a consistently growing industry
Cons
Tries to offset lower pay with non-cash benefits, leadership among the rank-and-file (non-executive) is not great and the company is carrying a ton of debt that is limiting its ability to pay its employees in-line with the market and broadly invest in its growth
Advice to Management
Focus on rank-and-file leaders that are recognized as top leaders by their employees more than their ability to manage up. Too many leaders in senior positions have a poor track record with their employees and that is starting to impact the executive leadership pipeline with people out-of-touch with the rank-and-file.

","This applies to legacy EMC teams. Everyone is still feeling the effects of the merger than happened 4 years ago. There are so many redundant teams no one knows which sales team to go to for help. The fact that there are so many redundant teams is what has caused the wave of endless layoffs. Internal sales tools are still disparate and the attempted consolidation has only caused more problems. It's painful to have to use 5+ tools to find information that should be found using 1. The portfolio is still too extensive and confusing for customers and it's consolidation has been too slow. This just isn't an interesting industry anymore. New product releases just offer more performance and more storage. The big 3 cloud providers are way more interesting places to work and actually frequently innovate with exciting products. I'd recommend trying to work there instead.
Advice to Management
Make it simpler for sales teams to actually quote our products. Simply the portfolio already and stop changing the names of products every 2 years.

That's great feedback for us! When it comes to perks like coffee and snacks, we recognize that they do tend to vary from site to site, and it might be worth raising the issue with your leadership.

Overall, it was a great experience for me as I have grown mentally and professionally throughout 2 years here at Dell. Unfortunately I got laid off even though I've achieved great performance.
","Management is very poor and manager does not have clear direction for the team.
Manager has so much workload but doesn't delegate tasks appropriately to team members to ease off the workload. This type of practice does not encourage employee to grow in their career and therefore excluding them out. Manager has poor leadership and doesn't understand their employee. Always micro manage and control what their employee should and should not do even though manager doesn't claim to micro manage. It seems like the environment is very unhealthy and toxic. Manager can be insecure and over dramatic at times.

This has to be one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard after a company goes through 2 quarters of the year with absolutely insane profits, better than ever before. Is the company going to look into changing things like at least 401K matching back, no, nothing is being looked into, just a heartfelt email thanking its employees for making them a ton of money. It might look like the executives are good giving up their salary, but that doesn't even begin to breathe on the money they are actually making in stock options ect. So they are hoarding this money in fear of the recession. News flash, you hoard money, your 150+ thousand employees are no longer spending as much, and the places they went to don't have as much money so they stop spending, and everyone stops spending, places closes and the economy crashes. So thank you Dell for contributing to the economic recession amid making billions in profit so far this year.
Advice to Management
I might have had good things to say about the executives and our leadership last year, but this year has really shown how awful this company is. The executives have no values and don't care about the employees, this is clear to me now. It makes me sad to think I used to enjoy working at this company and would give 5 stars across the board.

Health insurance premiums come with an extra fee as follows: if your spouse/significant other has access to health insurance at their job and you elect to enroll in DELL's health insurance program, you pay an additional premium of $1400 per year ( or thereabouts - that's how much it would've been for me) and it goes up based on your salary.
