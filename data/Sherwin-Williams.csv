Relatively low stress, the store hours are 7-7 on weekdays so no overnights or very early mornings. Doing truck is a good workout, and there will be downtime, so I have never felt exhausted at work. If you want a part-time job where you won't be bored and you will be (mostly) respected, this would be it.
","Not much formal product training, and a very steep learning curve if you are an outsider to the paint industry. Some contractors are very rude to part-timers, or straight up won't deal with them, but I haven't seen too many of them at this location. Depending on the location, management can be rude or overly-corporate. Do not expect this to be a job with many future growth options, unless you are willing to relocate to Cleveland.
Advice to Management
Please please please train your part-timers better on product knowledge, sales tactics, and how to resolve product issues. Even a pamphlet would be more formal instruction than we get now.

Very little contact from above except through email, and this is also a con at times. Very possible to create a fun atmosphere for employees and customers which has a lot to do with the non existent store visits. Good pay, when stores do well, company has become a lot better about giving raises to all employees. Not uncommon to be able to hire in PT and FT employees and pay more than other retail business by 2 to 4 bucks an hour. Management money can be great, have made over 50k in bonuses added up a few years. As long as you keep a team together, not hard to make some type of bonus money, minimum of 10k extra per year for 10 years here.
","Non existent store visits and check up. Works wonderful when management inside store provides more relaxing atmosphere. Unfortunately, lots of store management if easily scared into the opposite. We gets an unreal amount of emails that come accross as very stressful micromanagement at times. Can cause some store management to run staff off, as they push to hard to reach intentionally excessive goals. Upper management makes a point to let stores know goals are made to be excessive, they drive people harder... lack of supervision ove outside sales reps is a major issue. Half sales reps in company seem to ride around store to store, talking about everything besides paint and wasting time when they show up a few hours every few weeks. Reps and stores typically have communications issues and different expectations of each other.
Advice to Management
Watch your reps. They take advantage of store employees. Many are great. Many learn to look for new growing accounts in reports and add them to show they made new business gains and territory increases. If you randomly called most reps top 20 customer I bet half wouldn't even know them. Upper management actsnlike outside reps are everything to company, and rarely see action taken for performance issues with them.

Advice to Management
Please try not to have your district/city managers worry so much about the sales of outside-buys that are pleasing customers and growing in-store dollars even though it isn't through the typical sw ordering process.
Also very difficult to find opportunities within other segments of SW.
