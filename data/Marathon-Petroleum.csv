Continue growing work/life balance opportunities (alternate schedules, work from home, etc) to attract the most talented new-hires. Ensure that individuals have access to opportunities to grow their careers rather than becoming stagnant in a role. Don't let the short-term challenge of the pandemic compromise the long-term success of the organization.

3) Depressing city: I mean what were these people thinking? I wouldn’t wish living in Findlay on my worst enemy. Seriously, the entire city shuts down at 8 PM, has maybe 1 crappy token ethnic restaurant for each cuisine, and is surrounded by miles of cornfields for 50 miles+ in any direction. 

4) IT Culture is inept: The fish rots from the head down, the CIO to middle management have no idea of modern technology unless legacy VB.Net and C# is your idea of emerging technology. 

5) Poor talent retainment: Every year these fools bring in interns and try and talk up Marathon to them to convince them to come back because no other Fortune 50 company in their right mind would place their HQ in a rural rust belt town like they have so they act like they’re the biggest game in town when in reality they’re the only game in town (and for a reason).

Despite the stigma that often comes with an O&G company, MPC is truly trying to lead the industry in its environmental sustainability efforts, while remaining pragmatic and realistic about the world's demand for affordable and reliable energy. 

Not withstanding the corporate office in Findlay, MPC offers a great deal of work locations across the country that could fit anyone's desired geographic preference and allows those that desire it, to experience different cultures, climates, and cuisines.
","The CEO is old fashioned and out of touch. Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. 

The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. 

They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. 

Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. 

In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"". Despite being in a great position with a lot of future opportunity for growth, when that decision day comes for me, my road won't be going to Findlay.

- Micromanagement hardly describes this culture. Good ideas and independent thought are discouraged. Don’t even attempt to process improve. Only the top wigs make decisions while everyone else waits to be told what to do. This BREEDS inefficiency and mediocre performance.

- People are not selected based on their ability but rather how you look, who you know and sometimes who your family is. 

- Nepotism is not only allowed but enforced by leadership.

- This is not a pay for performance company. Regardless of your performance, you can expect no more than a 4% increase even with a promotion.

- Rather than operate with integrity, MPC would prefer employees contribute to their super PAC and lobby governments to change their laws. They’d rather buy politicians than do the responsible thing.

Practice what you preach! Diversity (sex, race, religion & social values) was non-existent at the corporate office. Human Resources at the Findlay office truly defines an entity looking out for the best interest of the company, rather than the employees.

 the bonus pool was created as part of the merger, and any unspent dollars go to MPC's bottom line, thus the incentive for Heminger's action.

I have been working at Marathon Petroleum full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Good Salaries and Benefits. Positive Community outreach.
Cons
Backward culture. Behind the times with Benefits policies (no Paternity leave or flexible work schedule). No development/training/recruiting for those outside of engineering. No work life balance if supporting production. Very little innovation or willingness to change. All Resources/Headcount/Budget are based on Solomon surveys (BBL/day versus what it takes to do the job safely and in a quality manner), so the larger refineries get the most
Advice to Management
Develop ALL of your people. Every department has great potential to contribute to the business if you evaluate how they fit in refining and how they can be developed in other facets of the business. BBL/day do not equate to what it takes to run a refinery with regards to budget. Take care of your departments/refineries fairly with regards to support.

","Management style of the good ole boy system. Certain hourly employees are belittled, not appreciated, brow beaten, taken for granted, and passed up for opportunities. They don't know the first thing about Diversity and Inclusion. Work life Balance is something they talk about but don't really give a damn about. The more you sacrifice yourself for their business needs the more they expect from you without merit. Brown-nosers and favorite employees thrive at this company. If you aren't either you will forever have the same title without any consideration for your advancement. They think they know it all and their ideas are the best. They don't take kindly to any questions pertaining to any of their decisions. They dismiss your ideas without even considering them. If they didn't think of it themselves than it's definitely not a good idea. They say they pay well as in middle of the road but they make you earn every cent of your wages. They discriminate against minorities even though they are qualified to do the same job as their majority counterparts. Everyone has their own agenda and think that their issues are more important than yours. High stress from multiple projects at all at once and very little staff to monitor them. Terrible coordination between projects as project leaders who literally office on the same floor do not talk to each other. They tie up employees times by asking the same question through multiple project leaders. Way too much computer based training and it's all C.Y.A for the company. Way too much FTMS designed to make sure you don't have a moment of free time to care about anything else. The project work and contractors who work there have priority over the employees when it comes to getting the project done quicker. Forget about having an actual weekend because the project is more important than your personal time! They overreact when it comes to preventing a mistake from reoccurring. Instead of offering help and training to the place where the problem occurred the entire division has adhere to drastic and unnecessary evasive actions. They harp about safety yet commit safety violations regularly. Tanks are brought back online even though they are missing several key items from an API653 service. Rules, procedures and policies only apply when there isn't money at stake. If you were part of a take over from another company you will always feel like an outsider who can't possibly know what they know. They constantly change programs around that fail due to lack of interest and promotion. Human resources and the Integrity hotline all favor the company and not the employee having concerns. If you are really having an issue you need to seek outside help or find another job! All roads lead to Findlay Ohio, need I say more? They are too proud to ask for outside help.
Advice to Management
A happy employee is a productive employee. Tip: Honey attracts more worker bees than Vinegar! Work at realizing that your production employees are your greatest asset. When you listen to concerns write them down and actually follow through with them. Be a manager/supervisor and look at the big picture. Make sure everyone is pulling their own weight and doing their job. Do not tolerate any brown-nosing or promote favoritism. Provide your employees with a managed lunch break! Contractors who work at your facilities have more of a lunch break than the employees do. That needs to change immediately and is a lawful violation. Be more transparent. Manage a good schedule so all employees can go home at an expected ending time everyday. Your poor planning skills should not equal an emergency and a sacrifice of an employee's personal time. Don't over work your employees into failure and then accuse them of having performance issues caused by your lack of management. Stop using the word ""Leadership"" unless you actually know what it means! Stop pretending to know what you are doing when it's clear to the rest of us that you don't! If you lack management skills and it's obvious please do everyone around you a favor and leave immediately! Stop taking credit for something you had nothing to do with! Give credit where credit is due. Stop being two faced and hypocritical, those bad traits don't look good on you at all! Hold employees accountable for their poor performance and let them know that you will not tolerate laziness. Stop asking other employees to do your job for you by asking them to tell another employee what to do. Stop wasting time on redundant old school ways of doing things and move with the times. Learn how to operate a smart phone and stop wasting so much paper. Grow a pair of Balls!

The pay is extremely good.
","There is pretty much zero diversity. This is a great company if you are a white conservative, but if not... don't expect to see many minorities. Most of the management team has been with the company for 30+ years, and are not very adaptive to change. 

When asked about flexible work arrangements, or the ability to work remotely the response from the CIO was ""it is our culture to work in an office, and we don't really see the need to change that.""

It seems that the culture here is about decade behind, and they don't really seem like changing that is a priority. 

Most new hires plan to stay for a few years because of the high pay, but then leave because of the culture, and because of there isn't really much to do in Findlay.

The company, on the other hand, has a lot of politics going on behind the scenes. If somebody challenges their process, they turn the other cheek. 

The open door policy exists only in certain organizations at Marathon. Within each organization, each department is led very differently. Depending on the manager you have will determine how far you will advance and how happy you will be in your job. There are many supervisors who operate in a ""two face"" manner. They will tell their subordinate about one thing, but say another when in the face of their manager. Supervisors at Marathon are not very well-trained. They look out for themselves rather than their team. They only care about their own advancement instead of who they are supposed to lead.

Training also needs to be more uniform across each organization.
