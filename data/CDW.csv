The salary needs to be adjusted. Too many people have to quit and return to make what they should be making. So many people are hired in at less than the minimum pay for that job if they’re internal because CDW insists on only providing 10% increase for promotions. CDW definitely doesn’t pay what it should to their coworkers.

I have the ability to pick my projects; they are not just assigned. If I am having an issue with a project, my manager and others are there to assist and if I request it. If things are really bad and I believe the project will fail because I cannot fix it, they will take it off my plate and give to someone else. And you are not judged poorly for doing it. In fact, you are praised for knowing your shortcomings and doing what is right for the project/customer.

Management is fair and listens to the employees. We take a survey each year, it is tabulated and then management comes out with an answer to the major issues and what will be done. They share that with the coworkers.

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at CDW full-time for less than a year
Pros
Associate program pays for materials needed for required certifications as well as the exams themselves.

Great internal mentoring structure that is unique to CDW from my personal perspective.

Network Security team is national, and most work has been mostly done remote. 

Company is constantly pursuing new security technologies, and is keen on ensuring the engineers get the proper training to be fully capable consultants for that technology.

Given the nature of consulting services (especially in the security sector), you are constantly being exposed to new technologies. When combined with plenty of projects, it makes for unique job security/opportunity in the form of constantly learning about new technologies that businesses are using/wanting to use.

If you have a passion for technology, starting out as an associate in a given track (NetSec, InfoSec, Enterprise, UC, Wireless) is an incredible opportunity without requiring a ton of previous job experience. The benefits of the program become more clear as you advance, and the connections to make internally and externally are very, very valuable.
Cons
Nature of the work itself often requires working late nights around weekends, depending on the technology/product you're deploying.

Base pay is decent, but salary reviews (for associates) relies on passing your second board exam. This requirement combined with massive Cisco certification changes forces the underlying internal curriculum to change. This places associates, especially those who started in 2019-2020, stuck between a rock and a hard place, as you must rapidly study and pass certifications, perform client work and prepare for a board exam that may or may not be changing.

If you fail your board exams, you're essentially delaying your potential for a raise, getting out of the associate program, and progressing your career with CDW.
Advice to Management
Consider changing the methodology/goals behind the board exams, and be fair to associates with compensation when considering the massive changes that, while necessary, have indirectly punished some that caused them lag in their progression. Some associates from various tracks have moved on from CDW because of this.

Not to mention goals are constantly set so high it’s almost impossible to achieve. The only people making real money are the highest level, CIO’s, CEO. Team managers have no real power to make change and upper level management is constantly hitting account managers with fees to pay for new resources. They’re constantly increasing work load and decreasing pay. The health plans are extremely expensive and not very good. You only get accumulated two weeks time off which is awful and 5 days sick time which also has to be accumulated. I’m not sure how they got best place to work this past year because everyone on the sales team hates working here and wants to quit. Save yourself the stress and work somewhere else.
Advice to Management
Increase pay and stop cutting base salaries and stop charging the sales team ridiculous fees for resources the company should be paying for.

Pros
An ocean of knowledge, experience, and high quality training at your fingertips. Not to mention impressive compensation when you complete the ACE program. Somebody told me that in your 18 months in the ACE program, you'll have the equivalent experience of 5 years as a typical network engineer. I believe that's probably true.
Cons
You're provided with everything you need to succeed. The only thing you'll have left to blame for failure is yourself.

Fri Nov 20 2020, Contractor,"Vernon Hills, IL",Former Employee ,Peace of mind,0,"I was assigned to work at 4 other companies in Lake County and one in Cook this year before coming to CDW. I left the other places because there safety for corannavirus was terrible. I was afraid to bring coronnavirus to my husband and his mom at home. i asked my manager to send me to CDW because the employees at my company told me about the reputation that CDW had for having great coronnavirus safety. They finally had an opening and sent me to CDW. It was amazing! The thermals cameras, the strict security guards that checked the floors all of the time to make sure everyone was behaving, and safety employee stopping by to see if I needed anything and tell me how to stay safe, and the way they take people out and hold them out 14 days if they are even a little sick just in case is very good. We all felt SUPER comfortable working there because the security guards and manager didn't mess around when it came to our safety. And they really care. They even have a HUGE poster in the CDC that tells us we are special and that they do it all for us. And we can tell they mean it because they would take time to make that and then act on it. I was pregnant and didn't tell anyone until I had to resign to have my daughter but I want to go back when my new daughter is old enough. I felt safer there than I did when I wasn't at work. We also got free food and employees and contractors were made to feel the same and respected. Oh and fun work.
","The only bad thing is having to leave and hoping I can get assigned back there. My husband works at a different company and when I tell him about our safety people and prosses he gets mad because his company is close to us and doesnt have anything like we do to stay safe. He had two friends that died from Coronnavirus that worked at his company. His mom's job is like his too and they keep closing and opening like my husbands because too many people getting sick in the warehouse and spreading coronnavirus to each other. So the con is that my husband doesnt work at CDW too because he would be safe if he did and I wouldnt worry. . The other bad thing is that many of the ops supervisors don't do anything but sit down and are too friendly with some of us ladies. Unprofessional. Place is cleaned all of the time but they have some clutter all over the place.
Advice to Management
My advise is keep doing great on safety because we are very thankful and comfortable. Thank you for the food. Thank you to all of the security people making sure to carry out the CDW safety laws. Make the supervisors be more responsible and involved with us but not flirty.. The managers and directors know it but don't do anything. If there is still coronnavirus around when I can go back to wirk, I will only go to CDW because they are good and keep me alive and well.

Sun Oct 18 2020, Corporate Human Resources Manager,"Lincolnshire, IL",Current Employee ,Pivoting for Success amidst a Global Pandemic,1,"* Handling of the COVID-19 Crisis: CDW enabled the great majority of us to work from home back in March. Investing in the technology and tools to make us effective from our home offices. Leadership has extended WFH through at least 1/1/21 for our health and safety. The company has gone to great extents to keep the distribution center coworkers and contractors safe during this trying time while they continue to deliver for our customers.

*Keeping our Customers at the Center: All coworkers can articulate how what they do everyday helps our customers. It's a shared mission to help our customers with all of their technology needs - and those coworkers who live the mission are rewarded well. 

*Innovation and Growth - Top leadership has invested heavily (bringing in key talent and funding projects) to position CDW for what the future will bring. I have a high degree of confidence that we are prepared for whatever tech trends are next.
","*Not seeing coworkers: My favorite part of the job was being in the office with my teammates. Working from home is convenient but I miss the interaction and fun of being together in the office. Can't wait until this pandemic is behind us and it is safe to return!

Tue Sep 22 2020, Account Representative,,Current Employee ,Very Challenging but Can be Lucrative,0,"For a large company, it's a pretty good one to work for. Management is usually competent and professional. The executives are transparent with the company's direction, goals, and pains. Benefits are average but healthcare costs are more than average. The company believes in advancing your career and finding new internal opportunities. They also believe in charitable causes and even have a charitable match program.
","Work-from-home programs have been frowned upon by many departments/positions, but hopefully that changes post-COVID. I know healthcare costs are always rising, but my CDW healthcare cost is always more than my wife's has been at her employers. Account representative/account manager roles at CDW are very difficult. Base salary is extremely low and even goes down after your second year. The biggest issue though is there's barely any time for proactive selling, which is what we should be doing. Internal processes are extremely time-consuming and wrought with problems. It's basically 80% of your time is more like project management. It's a very transactional sales role. The first two years in the role are extremely difficult and hard to make a decent wage.
Advice to Management
Continue to invest into improving internal processes to give the sales team more time to spend with customers and proactive selling. Give us the tools to be able to work from home (even outside of COVID) in order to retain talent. Be fair with distribution of customer accounts.

Advice to Management
Spend time with your sellers. Understand what they do that makes the company money and work to increase their efficiency. Spend some money hiring competent people in critical back bone departments that sellers rely on to do their jobs. Have management get involved by inspiring sellers, showing them how to navigate a conversation or close a deal. How to make the customer understand a sense or urgency etc. Do not force nonsense training on sellers who already have limited time in the day to do their jobs. Make sure each employee has what they need to be successful and work to set each employee up for success. Remove leadership that is lazy and does the bare minimum and replace them with coworkers from within CDW that understand the sales cycle, customer relationship etc and are hard workers.

Advice to Management
There is a lot of red tape that stops your salesforce from making sales. If you could make processes more efficient sales would increase. 

Invest in your sales team, this will pay off huge. It will lower turnover both internally and with customers leaving CDW. (instead of forcefully ""requesting"" coworkers to install an MDM on a personal phone; buy them a work phone)

Stop unnecessary meetings when salespeople could be selling. A lot of pointless tasks throughout the day kills focus on whats actually important i.e selling

Provide more incentive to continue working at CDW, i.e don't lower base pay by $5000 once employees are promoted to senior account managers. After a year of working here it makes since for AM's to look for other positions at different organizations. Top talent wont stay here for long.

Fri May 15 2020, Accounts Manager,"Chandler, AZ",Former Employee ,Low Pay High Bureaucracy,1,"CDW offers an academy program that gives fairly in depth training on a wide breadth of product offerings. The academy gives you a decent baseline understanding of business technology.

Good place to start your career if you don't have a college degree as it will allow you to begin to build a professional network where you can find a legit technology sales job.
","Of hundreds of technology companies offering sales positions in the greater Phoenix area this is the lowest I've seen in terms of pay (25,000$ base and a tiny commission on everything you sell). Don't be fooled by ""uncapped"" commission. The SMB teams might have 1 rep out of 20 with a six figure salary. Comparitively an entry level sales development role at a software company will range from 40-80,000$ and an actual opportunity for a short path to six figures.

If you can get past starting at $25,000 a year thinking you'll grind harder than all of your peers you better make sure that you fall within the bureaucratic plans of the husband and wife that lead the chandler office. No matter how hard you work there will be no opportunity for advancement if you do not fall within those 2 directors social rank. At other companies there are various factions that can aid your advancement not just 1 couple. When you leave the company it will almost certainly not be on good terms in managements view.

It used to be sort of fun until management grossly misbehaved at happy hours and forced a 2 drink maximum and if you're seen having a drink at lunch you will be fired.

Overall - If you're college educated without obvious professional red flags you have far greater opportunities than working for 25,000$ in the suburbs for dying monolithic company.

","There is a severe lack of accountability in every department that supports the sales organization. For example, ""customer service"" doesn't actually service any customers. If a customer asks the most basic question of them, they forward the customer to their sales reps.

These groups are extremely difficult to work with. The biggest frustrations every single day are with internal groups, without a doubt.
Advice to Management
Stop allowing support departments to be so isolated from sales, so much so that they forget CDW is a SALES organization. They truly seem to have lost sight that behind every inquiry, behind every request or order is a customer that a sales rep has to answer to and ultimately depends on a satisfied customer for our livelihood. Customer service needs to be paramount to everything, not our own processes and procedures.

","CDW is a huge corporation that uses new hires and ARs as Bottom-feeders to support the rest of the company. You make a below livable Salary and are given a starter book that consists of angry customers that don't spend with CDW anymore for numerous reasons. Commission scale is set up to have you pay back your first year's salary to CDW in the first 6 months based on the 3% of the profit you will be earning. Profit is also very hard to attain since Amazon and other big players offer the same stuff for A LOT cheaper. This company is the definition of churn and burn when it comes to new hires. If you like feeding a huge corporate whale and watching CDW take all of your profits and hard earned commissions your first 3 years then this job is for you!
Advice to Management
Telling employees that they are doing themselves an ""injustice"" by not working as much overtime as possible each week to make up for the unlivable salary and ripoff commission scale is a complete joke. Also, telling employees they need more ""Grit"" and to just ""stick it out 2+ years and then its worth it"" doesn't help keep employee retention. Stop speaking a work/life balance when this company allows no WFH ability until year 3, and even then its only 1 day a month. CDW uses this old churn and burn model they started years ago to help feed their upper management at the top and make sure they milk every dime out of their new hires.

Also, telling employees they need more ""Grit"" and to just ""stick it out 2+ years and then its worth it"" doesn't help keep employee retention. Stop speaking a work/life balance when this company allows no WFH ability until year 3, and even then its only 1 day a month. CDW uses this old churn and burn model they started years ago to help feed their upper management at the top and make sure they milk every dime out of their new hires.

Advice to Management
There needs to be a cultural shift from the top down surrounding working from home. This is currently a right given to Sales as it relates to an individuals production (revenue or 'sales performance index' - basically the same). This is not industry standard and I'd love to CDW be progressive on this front. There will always be bad eggs that abuses this system, but my question to senior leadership is as follows. 

Are the few people that will abuse the system worth stifling a policy that might inherently boost overall productivity and work life balance?

-for temp-to-hires your employment does not officially start until you are hired directly. So if you are employed in a 3/6/12 month temp position regardless of how long you've been at the job, day 1 of your official CDW hire date you start with 0 vacation or sick hours. PTO is accrued at a rate of 6.66 vacay hrs a month, sick at 3.33 hrs a month so by keeping you temp-to-hire for 6 months you lose 1 full week of vacation vs. direct hire - a.k.a. try not to get hired as a contractor if you can help it.
-pay is embarrassingly low,
-benefits are poor - starts at 2 weeks vacation, doesn't increase until 4 years in
-paternity leave starts at 1 day after 1 year of employment and caps at 3 days total
-for a IT company with teams spread across multiple locations and the connectivity to support it the fact that remote work is frowned upon at best and completely denied at worst is absurd
- change is incredibly slow
Advice to Management
You're losing competent coworkers because you don't provide incentives for talented people to stay. Benefits and compensation for non-sales coworkers are *embarrassing*. The company would rather let consistently high-performing and highly-valued coworkers (by direct managers) who are generally happy to stay in their roles, just leave than consider minor non-performance-affecting accommodation that would keep them even with your terrible pay and benefits. 
It's really a race to the bottom for you - this isn't news either - your company survey consistently tells you that WLB and benefits are where you're failing and yet you change nothing.

There is a lot of talent and knowledge in the managed services and field services departments, so it's a great place for learning from your peers. The work environment is fairly relaxed, and even when sh!t hits the fan everyone still keeps their cool. Most of management would rather discuss issues than bark orders at their subordinates.
","As time goes on, the company makes you feel more and more like a number and less like a person. Upper management and HR care more about if you are on-time than how much work you get done or how much value you add to the company. They push on supervisors to come down hard on employees for being 5 minutes late, but could care less if you work an additional 1 or 2 hours on top of your 12 hour shift.

Sun Jun 23 2019, Field Account Executive,,Current Employee ,Great people!,7,"I love the people I work with. Down to earth. Hard working. Easy to get along with. I’ve not run into any one that’s a jerk. There are many folks that have been here 10+ years—very rare in tech sales—and I think that says a lot.

We have an enormous portfolio that we sell. Services, software, cloud, hardware, telecom, etc. We are the number one vendor for so many companies. Our reach is tremendous.
","We have some archaic processes and metrics, as you might expect at a Fortune 500 company that’s 25 years old. Some of our sales tools are out dated...sometimes very outdated. 

We have the very common comp plan problem in sales of adding 15% to what you did last year and making that your goal next year. No matter what the actual situation was. So if you have a big win at an account and now they aren’t buy much for a few years, you can find yourself in a very difficult position. 

The pay here is low compared to the industry as a whole. As with any sales job, there’s the opportunity to make good money to be sure. But I think you need to look at it as a place where you’re trading some of the crazy upside you’d have at some companies for a more stable and predictable income.
Advice to Management
Please update some of our old tools and slim down the number of tools we use.
Please consider changing the comp plan to take into account the actual situations that sales people run into year to year.

Tue Jun 04 2019, Executive Account Manager,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,A Great Place to Start Your Career - An AM Review,6,"The training program is one of the best in the industry. Even with no background in IT hardware/software/services sales, CDW does an excellent job of preparing you to be successful and giving you the tools & resources to do so. The culture is also top notch. Almost everyone is extremely willing to help you be successful, and your engineering talent & Solution Architects will give you the blueprint to qualify opportunities as an Account Manager. If you land in the right patch, there is a genuine opportunity to make money. I was an Account Manager for 6 years and made six figures for the last 4 of the 6. 

That said, you do have to exercise patience and know that those first two years will be extremely challenging. Likely 45-55K total pay. But, if you can stick it out and prove yourself, you will get opportunities to be successful. 

There are constantly vendors in the office giving free lunches, swag, happy hours after work, and promoting vacations & prizes for being top sellers of a specific product. The vacations are amazing, and always extremely well put together.

Speaking of, the vacation time and benefits are adequate. Nothing will wow you, but nothing will make you feel like you are being taken advantage of, either.

Sales Managers tend to be extremely flexible, friendly, and willing to help you succeed if you demonstrate a desire to. I had 5 managers in 6 years, and only one borderline negative experience that did not last long.

Overall, this is a fantastic place to begin your career if you have little to no sales experience. The first 2 years may make it challenging for anyone with experience or major life expenses (car, mortgage, kids, etc.), but if you are just graduating and looking for somewhere to work while living with parents or sharing an apartment with people, CDW should absolutely be near the top of your list.
","As odd as this may sound, it is possible to be TOO successful at CDW. The best Account Managers are extremely well compensated, but because of that, it makes a move to any other position internally a pay cut. Some choose to do it for more stability in terms of a higher base salary, but it can be challenging psychologically to accept a total comp cut to move “up” in to leadership.

You do move on to a different comp structure after your first 4 years as a sales rep, one that effectively makes you 100% commission. You’re still guaranteed a base salary, but you have to sell to cover it. For me, this wasn’t an issue given the business I had developed but for some, it pushes them out of the AM role.

The competition is fierce. There are many VARs out there, and all of your large accounts will be doing business with many of them. This can lead to eroding profit margins that make it difficult for you to make money until you develop a relationship with the customer, which can take years.

The Cloud services practice needs more of an investment in personnel, etc. Other VARs are lapping CDW in terms of Advanced Technology services offerings, especially in the Cloud space. Many of your major accounts will still look at CDW as a “box pusher”, even as it has evolved to a complete solutions provider. Battling that stigma can be challenging.

Depending on the territory you are assigned to, the first 2 years can be very mentally draining. You will likely start working with smaller accounts, ones that have been called on for years that don’t do business with CDW. You will fail, ALOT. You will lose, ALOT. Knowing and accepting that going in will help you to look long term at the role.

There are a lot of fun outings. The technical training is pretty good. Learn as much as you can and then leave quickly.
","Lowest compensation in the industry. Absolutely poor senior leadership. Managers will put in commission adjustments and give away gross profit to other AMs without your knowledge. Very little growth potential unless you’re the ‘right candidate’ (CDW is really trying to be PC right now). Managers seem incapable of handling conflict. Inbound constantly violates rules and regulations and steal orders and management does nothing to hold them accountable. Very little investment in human capital. Senior leaders create new titles for themselves to seem relevant. Certain segments have no support or ISA who will only work with top performers. It’s a mess. Get in and learn the industry and then get out quickly.
Advice to Management
Have the backbone to deconflict actual issues facing your subordinates. Invest in human capital. Pay your employees a living wage. The only reason you have your title is because you stuck around long enough or created it.

All sorts of free food & swag from vendor partners. Wide product portfolio affords you the ability to learn about a LOT of different technologies, and network with your peers at the OEM. Fair career advancement, depending on what you want to do. LOTS of training to learn about different solutions and products. Opportunity to make some decent money, assuming you've built a solid book of business. Lots of resources to lean upon for help internally to assist with calls, quotes, and product questions. Great experience if you're looking to advance your career in sales.
","the base pay is very low for the industry (25K but it may be 30K now) Can be tough on a new rep the first couple of years. You can make more $$ on the draw IF IF IF you've set up your book of business (or have legit accounts) to support it. Compensation plans can change from year to year, but I think that's probably any publicly owned sales gig. The process to sell services internally can be tough and painfully slow to navigate, and at times it can be slow to get some things done internally due to the company size. Each year a bit more and more responsibilities are piled onto reps in an effort to shave costs and maximize company profit.

The environment is great as the company really makes sure to think of coworkers as individuals with different needs and the company provides many resources to help support their coworkers. Also, the term coworker is used for all individuals, regardless of their role. The reason the company refers to employees this way is because it shows that everyone has a lot of value, no matter their role in the company. 

The company also does a lot for their coworkers by providing a lot of perks that go a long way towards saving money such as free food, clothes, housewares, etc. 

In addition, the company provides a lot of growth opportunities for your career and tend to promote from within. 

Overall, the company truly shows that it cares about their coworkers.
","The main challenge that I've been aware of during my years with the company is that they could provide a higher base salary for many different roles and what compounds this is the fact that the company tends to run pretty lean in terms of overall headcount, particularly outside of sales. However, a lot of people tend to stay at CDW for many, many years and this says a lot about everything else the company offers given that people in a decent size city could likely find a similar role that pays a higher base salary.

So, I’ll let everyone here know the skinny as too what’s going on at CDW. They’re grabbing recent grads and paying them crap money, so they can flip that for a buck by hoping they make up for it within the year. 

You might do well! So I don’t want to discourage you. However, it’s a saturated market and CDW is not cheap. Management will tell you “people buy from people they like.” That was true before price comparisons can be done at the snap of a finger. They pay off profit mostly, so good luck medlar/SMB. 

It’s been a weird time, and I’ve appreciated the business, but I think there will need to be some major changes for them to keep with much much cheaper VARS. Sure, a business relationship is great, but there’s also a bottom line that CDW can’t protect.

","Trainers speak broken english as a second language. Coworkers and immediate supervisors will openly mock and insult you for not knowing what they already know in their 20+ years of experience. If you don't walk talk and act like everyone else they will bully and harass you until they run you out. HR and upper management will ignore you when you bring up the harassment and abhorrent behavior of coworkers and direct supervisors. The clique of hispanic 20+ year employees are dug in deep and will do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo of mediocrity. One of the worst experiences of my life. My last hours there, at the vernon hills in illinois location, I felt I was in imanent physical harm.

To put it another way - I was descriminated against due to my appearence. I'm a reasonably healthy, non-obese individual who tries to eat healthy. Had I documented the harassment better, if I had money to pay for lawyers or felt comfortable in that whole legal system I'd think about pressing charges (after building more of a case first). But I I have none of those things. 

CDW hires sheep. They want the most vulnerable individuals in society (undocumented, hearing impaired, indebted students, wage-slave parents, elderly etc) to quietly toil away while nary raising a peep or causing any waves. I say this because how I was completely ignored when I brought up how the good ol' hispanic boys were treating me.

This is about the pick-pack department closest to the entrance of where the warehouse employees enter. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.

If you love to shmooze - have at it, and good luck to you.

Potential for extremely high income.
The Chicago location is a great place to work.
Benefits are good. Also, there is a variety of fringe benefits, such as free happy hours, free lunch, free outings, and prizes, to name a few.
","The Dallas location is a terrible place to work. If you want to work for CDW, move to Chicago. The biggest Con lies squarely on the leaders in the Dallas office. The leadership in Dallas is lazy, ego driven, and is incapable of helping their staff improve/succeed. They don't seem to be motivated to be good leaders , they're more focused on their job security.
Career development, or assistance in growing your sales acumen, is non-existent in Dallas.
Hard work by a sales rep is not rewarded in Dallas.
This is a named account environment and if management provides a bad account with no potential, then you will not make money. The managers will not put effort into fixing this issue.

Fri Mar 30 2018, Account Manager,"Cherry Hill, NJ",Former Employee ,"Lots of work, but can be very rewarding.",6,"The training program they put you through initially is really comprehensive in getting you up to speed on the fundamentals of IT and all of the product segments that you'll be covering. I'm sure it could differ from team to team, but after training my manager always seemed to focus on our personal goals and development, and I never felt any pressure to simply hit numbers. There's a good sense of camaraderie between your team and the group you've gone through training with - although many of them went on to separate teams we still keep in touch years later. The pay probably won't be amazing for most your first year or two unless you hit some luck or really grind at it, but it's probably comparable to similar positions with other companies, except with a lot of added perks. Expect to be inundated with free food, contests, and branded freebies from all of the vendor partners. A lot of opportunity for lateral promotions or to specialize in/work for many of the vendors. The work itself can be a slog some days, but they really seem to do as much as possible to motivate their employees.
","Expect to make tons of cold calls daily. Probably 80-100+ early on until you start gaining some traction and have to focus more time on actual customers. I never encountered any negativity, but you'll be leaving a lot of voicemails, hitting dead ends on leads, and chasing after elusive IT managers day after day. 
They provided you with a starter book of business, but you'll quickly have to start prospecting your own leads if you want to get anywhere. Your initial book might have a few diamonds in the rough, but they're mostly hand-me-downs from other account managers on your team because they got nowhere with them.
Finding good customers can seem like a struggle sometimes depending on what your territory is. Some of the more successful account managers seemed to get their break by sharing an account with a more experienced team member - make connections and be eager to learn from them because the odds of getting in on the ground floor with a growing company seemed pretty slim.

For Sales Managers (hiring). I think you should spend more time building your AR's initial book of business.

","Pay scale is weighted unfairly. High revenues are needed to hit maximum payout on commission scale. It benefits tenured account managers that have accounts spending $30mil+ a year, while newer account managers get smaller, scrappy accounts and are expected to make a living off the lower commission payouts. Goals are also increased 10-20% every year, no matter what environmental issues or industry trends are taking place (example - even when new ordinances are passed in government, and some customers will knowingly have smaller budgets, goals are still increased 10-20%). The company is great to work for if you're not in sales, but the cynical environment and ridiculous expectations make it a less than ideal company to work for.

-Work life balance 
-Great management and support 
-Commuter benefits--401k/stock purchase plan 
-Training and development--best in the industry. Personalized attention in academy/residency 
-Schmooze and booze with the partners. Build the relationships to get deals tossed your way....but beware of the BS. Most sales people are hard to trust. Most AMs would rather see a boost in our paycheck instead of attending dumb happy hours at Blackie’s downstairs.
","-Dealing with unhappy customers and unpleasant customers that BS you, don't pay invoices, demand the impossible, and just plain suck. As a woman, it’s also difficult to strike early success with some IT managers that are not really used to working with women. Most of your account contacts are men—-a good 95%. Some are nasty and just don’t give a crap about how much you help them. 
-No work from home rights until you hit senior AM role and you only get 1 day from home
-Commission structure changes--after you are here 3 years, NO BASE--you only get paid once a month and have to hit certain metrics to get that paycheck Of course being in Chicago, it’s just not feasible to live on your own. Looking at your paycheck can be depressing and makes you want to curl up in a ball. 
-No customer visits (depending on territory)--hard for customers to put a face to voice. Your competition can go on site, but you cannot. traveling is restricted to execs for conferences. 
-The paycheck is probably the worst part of the role. Do not expect to make good $$ the first few years--however you are told that your books will change--if you put the time and effort in, you will gain great spending accounts. 
-Starting commission until you are promoted onto hiring team is mediocre. SELL, SELL, SELL to get a bigger %.
-Unsure if its difficult to move to a corporate role from a sales role--tenured AMs tend to stick in sales--obviously, the make good $$ to not want to go elsewhere. 
-Tenured AMs tend not to be inclusive and like to include newer reps into their clique 
-there isn’t a lot of micro management, but you’re consistently told to make more calls and get your “touches up” to keep your job. If your average falls below a certain amount, you may be fired. It’s hard to stomach a job that mainly entails being a telemarketer and making cold calls. Definitely not proud of that part of the role.

Also, you will be pulled into endless training's that will be of little to no use to you and you will also be asked to complete other useless training's that pull you away from your job. And lastly, you will find that the thing that will impede you making as much money as you want is not your customers but the company itself. Your resources are stretched and overworked. So, like any other rational human being would do, they prioritize those who bring them the largest deals.

I have been working at CDW full-time for less than a year
Pros
I won't get into specifics as even a few details will remove the anonymity of this review. I'll just say that I picked CDW over a better offer at another Fortune 500 because the reviews on this site seemed to show that employees were happier than at the other company. 

A couple of months in I knew why I got sidelined while on a gig and the voice from all of my management was 'don't worry about anything else but getting better so you can get back into the game'. My manager even offered to fly my family to where I was, on the company dime. I can't say that any other company would have done that for their people.

I'll also say that I work with some fantastic people that motivate me to improve my skills so I can be on their level, it's great to be around such amazingly bright people.
Cons
So I haven't seen many cons of working here yet.

Some of the co-workers were way to entitled for not having any certifications, degrees, or prior experience outside of the company. They do NOT hire outside of contract-to-hire in IT. You basically have to deal with a year or more of no benefits, no company perks, and totalitarian submissive behavior. Pay is well below average as well. I would not recommend working IT at this company.
Advice to Management
Hire people with real experience in IT. Hire managers that are actually trained in IT. Don’t let your personal relationships with your employees get in the way of your job. Don’t allow your tenured employees call the shots if their not better educated and trained in the field then the people working around them. Quit dragging long-term contract workers out.

","Pay is way below industry standard and it is based on position and not promotional merit. Management is not going to be transparent about the commission structure and after 2 years coworker loses the low base salary. CDW also takes 20% of a coworker's SPIFF money, which accounts for about 30% of their overall earnings. If the coworker is in a pre-sales role within CDW S3, the bonus is capped at 150% and there is no SPIFF money. Overall, CDW turnover rate is very high because of the total compensation.

Upward promotions are rare and CDW prefers to hire from outside the company to prevent internal conflict among coworkers. Going through the Emerging Leaders Program has a high opportunity cost for the coworker because of the amount of time it takes to complete the training. New Sales Managers are tossed around and start in the academy with low-revenue teams, which directly impacts their pay. 

Culture varies across each department and CDW partner-funded teams are often in conflict with their external partner stakeholders. This results in an internal toxic culture that persists and CDW will often take the side of the partner and eliminate the coworker or the entire team. The internal bureaucracy also stifles any innovation and management listens top-down, which affects the customer experience.
Advice to Management
The company is good for shareholders and bad for coworkers, it needs a union.

Executive Management should eliminate the existing leadership in Coworker Services and set a new transparency initiative to address coworker questions surrounding pay.

Executive Management should eliminate the pay caps to improve sales performance.

Executive Management should eliminate partner-funded roles and directly fund those positions. When CDW accepts this money, the company implicitly loses control of the business unit and this affects the customer. 

Executive Management must encourage internal promotion from within the company.

Executive Management makes decisions from the top-down and it should come from the bottom up as recommendations from the sales teams since they are interfacing directly with customers.

Sun Oct 01 2017,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Good, but room for improvement...",3,"- At a high level, good company culture. People rarely get fired, and when they do it's because of inappropriate behavior.

- Lots of free food (mostly unhealthy)/perks from vendors.

- Great Chicago location.

- Good career progression opportunities; I went from an AM, to Partner Specialist/BDS, to ISA over time.

- Easy to land a job with a vendor after tenure.

- Good money to be had.

- Good work/life balance, managers tend to be hands-off.
","- Suburban locations are off the beaten path, you're better off driving (they have a shuttle which sucks).

- Management in S3 was pretty bad, a side effect of having old sales guys try to be businessmen. 

They're only good for popping into meetings to say generic things like ""What's the ask here?"" and ""We need to come up with a more efficient way of doing this."" 
Awful, but we all had to suck up to them. 

- Fellow ISA's were a bit arrogant, to the point that AM's were shy to reach out to them. They tended to be belittling to sales reps for not being ""technical"" enough. 
I had AM's outside my territory reach out to me as their assigned ones were, in their words, ""rude"".

- Lots of finger-pointing when business slows - CDW blames vendors, vendors blame CDW, etc.

- Chicago office bathrooms are gross. 

- You have to request access to use the company's WiFi...for a tech company that's pretty silly. 

- People here tend to wear super loud shoes - it was like Jurassic Park with the water rippling sometime. Do you have to stomp around the office?

- Lack of diversity in some departments.

Pros
Team - Probably one of my favorite aspects from CDW is the team you work with. There's always someone willing to help not to mention that you get the chance to work with some very smart people.

Learning Opportunities - Cdw encourages engineers to seek other training opportunities so that they can enhance/learn new skills. Cdw will also help pay for certification if that is a route you wish to take.

Ability to work from home

Compensation

Associate Program - Probably one of the best programs out there. CDW gives you the opportunity to develop into a full engineer by shadowing and helping in actual projects.

Fri Sep 22 2017,N/A,, ,Most unethical employer on Earth!!,6,"My coworkers were the only positives to working here. Without them, I would not have lasted here as long as I did.
","Where should I even begin? Okay, first of all, the HR department is extremely unethical!! On multiple occasions, they breached confidentiality and spread my personal business ALL AROUND THE ENTIRE COMPANY to other employees, managers, even people not working for the company!!! Secondly, the whole time I worked for CDW, I honestly felt like I was back in the 2nd grade!! Groups of managers and their fellow buddies in HR would break off into little cliques and alienate everybody else around them who obviously wasn't worthy of joining them. Seriously, some of the managers and the HR people here had desperate insecurity issues and constantly relied on ego stroking and validation of their obviously quite injured personal feelings. Lastly, communication was poor and morale was also even lower! Nothing is ever resolved here at CDW because nobody there has any guts to stand up and do the right thing. Nobody there has any guts to speak up and say ""hey, we're not going to engage in this type of behavior any longer because it's not right, it hurts our employees when we gossip about them, and it's also not fair to blacklist or target our employees."" There's nobody in senior leadership, both management and HR here at this company CDW who has any guts to stand up and do the right thing. Management is allowed to basically run wild and do whatever it wants, all the while the whole time with corrupt HR's supreme blessing...
Advice to Management
The first advice is to stop attempting to justify everything and explain it all away. I read the employer response below to another employee reviewer's Glassdoor review, and that is honestly total baloney!! There is nothing fair or honest about working here for CDW, so stop pretending there is by tagging on employer response comments to the contrary. Now for my second piece of advice: HR and management here at CDW, all of you please go back to school and take Ethics 101. Many of you are extremely unethical and don't know how to play fairly or treat your employees right. My third and best piece of advice to give to management and HR here at CDW is to just quit. Honestly, that's the best advice: JUST QUIT ALREADY! Many of you working in HR and both management here at CDW have no clue how to run a company, nor do you have even the slightest clue of how to treat your people respectfully, fairly, with value, and like they actually matter!

On the shipping side of things. The productivity system that is in place now. Is flawed!, it seems as tho it's all about numbers!! numbers!! numbers!! if you don't make your numbers your in trouble after awhile. That puts a great deal of stress on coworkers just trying to make their numbers everyday. Coworkers start getting greedy, they go after all the easy work for themselves everyone is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. More likely to mess up. I'm telling you to whoever reads this. It would be far better to have a error system in place instead. You get so many errors a year an if you make to many you get suspended or what have you. That way you would be able to retain workers for longer just go until your done, less stressed. Just like part of the moto says "" we listen"" so listen.

","Poor Supervisors with no experience and no training. Pay is low and ""raises"" are less than 3% yet your review will always say how great of a worker you are. Going above and beyond will become the norm or is considered to be a part of your job. Laziness and stupidity are valued and praised yet hard workers are just given more work since they are the only competent people. There needs to be more oversight as to who gets hired and how skilled they are. Last few people hired on my team can't even send a properly worded email and yet the Supervisor loves them and praises them for doing crap work. Favoritism will get you a long way at this company. If you try to transfer out of your team/dept, HR will give some bs about how you cannot get more than a 10% raise, yet they offer outsiders double/triple the amount for the same role. So there is no incentive to want to transfer.

Pros
For the love of God, do NOT work here, working here is Psychological Torture!!!
Due to the unbelievably high turnover rate, if you're breathing and speak English you'll probably get a job.
Cons
No training or good communication between departments. Managers are not concerned about employees you are just a number and money making machine. There is a culture of back stabbing and general disconnect between co-workers. CDW treats you like a number and then throws you under the bus a couple of times due to their lack of experience. It's quite possible that you will witness someone truly losing it there. Unless you enjoy that sort of thing, it's hard to believe that you would be happy at CDW. Bonuses and advancement potential exist only in theory. You will quit or be fired long before they don't fulfill any promises. You might be asked to do something that compromises your ethics, if you have any. So don't work there if that's not your thing. CDW doesn't do right by clients by the way, they please their customers by throwing their employees under that bus again. Worst possible company out there, they are not ready for the I.T. industry, the CDW way is basically there way or the highway.

Advice to Management
Pros: Free food, work from home opportunities.Cons: Lack diversity, lack of investment, unfair treatment, and low pay.CDW has an excellent culture on the surface. Cliques are heavy at and no matter how hard you work, you are subjected to how people perceive you and perception may not always be a reality. Leadership has these monthly and quarterly ""check ins"" just to check off a box but have no real investment in your future. Diversity and Inclusion is a SERIOUS problem at CDW but it varies by department. There isn't a lot of minority leaders and they feel that having a women group (primarily white) solves the issues with diversity. Its feels like more of a fraternity house-either you're in or you're out-and if you're not ""in"" you are made to feel that way. The pay isn't competitive and they try hard to realign departments to make the company more attractive. Would I recommend CDW, sure, if you are fresh out of college and is looking for a first step. Otherwise, I would be apprehensive-especially if you're a minority.

CDW is incredibly committed to attracting, retaining and engaging a diverse workforce. We are proud of the numerous programs we've implemented to help every coworker be as successful as possible. We take any claims not in line with The CDW Way very serious. I encourage you to contact the Ethics and Compliance Office directly by calling 847.419.6160 or feel free to contact me directly Jen Sommesi jennlau@cdw.com 312-705-0157","Pros: Free food, work from home opportunities.Cons: Lack diversity, lack of investment, unfair treatment, and low pay.CDW has an excellent culture on the surface. Cliques are heavy at and no matter how hard you work, you are subjected to how people perceive you and perception may not always be a reality. Leadership has these monthly and quarterly ""check ins"" just to check off a box but have no real investment in your future. Diversity and Inclusion is a SERIOUS problem at CDW but it varies by department. There isn't a lot of minority leaders and they feel that having a women group (primarily white) solves the issues with diversity. Its feels like more of a fraternity house-either you're in or you're out-and if you're not ""in"" you are made to feel that way. The pay isn't competitive and they try hard to realign departments to make the company more attractive. Would I recommend CDW, sure, if you are fresh out of college and is looking for a first step. Otherwise, I would be apprehensive-especially if you're a minority.

CDW is hands down the best organization that I’ve worked for. Between the associate programs, and opportunities to grow personally and professionally, they care about their work force. It shows too. CDW ranks in the top 10% during the annual surveys for employee satisfaction. The talent that CDW has on their workforce is superlative, and you always have someone to go to with questions – at any level of your professional career. While CDW is a large organization, the individual branches provide a smaller organization feel. Freedom of schedule and trust as a consultant is one of my favorite things at CDW. You truly can work autonomously, as a trusted professional should be able to do. If you want to work for a company, STRONGLY consider CDW. You won’t regret it.
","CDW does see a bit of turnover in the HMS side of the house. While this is common with data centers, it may be indicative of needed change. Also, customers of CDW do require you to sacrifice some of your weekends, and nights. If this is a problem for your work/life balance, CDW may not be the best fit. Management promotes work life balance, but its ultimately up to you to enforce it.

- Great Atmosphere
- Great Support 

I really liked working at CDW. It was my first real ""corporate job"" out of college and it gave me an idea of what I would need to do to be successful in the business world. The people are great and there is always support from higher management to progress in a seriously cut-throat business. 

The people are the only reason I stayed at CDW for as long as I did. Perks are good - free lunches at points during the week, always getting snacks, t-shirts, water bottles etc.. for free from vendors as a incentive to sell their products.

-Great training programs
","Their metrics are outdated. If you are not talking on the phone to clients a minimum of 2 hours a day and hitting your metrics for the dials, you can be written up even if you hit your revenue goals. So you could crush your target by 200% but only spoke on the phone for an average of 1:59/ day and get written up. 

Also the base salary is seriously low. For a company that is making upwards of 13 Billion dollars in revenue/ year it is a little embarrassing what they actually pay you. I have heard that it just recently was bumped up a bit for new hires but it is still well below what is normal. Also the commission structure in which you get paid off of is not attractive. Recruiters will do what they can to tell you the success stories of a few reps that make amazing amounts of uncapped commissions but again when there are upwards of 4,000 sales reps that is the exception not the rule.

If you are in MedLar after 4 years you lose your base salary so you are paid entirely off of your commission. That is why many people leave CDW within that time frame because they go to a job that continues to pay them their base salary regardless of how long they have been there. 

Limited amount of ability to upgrade career path - The problem is when you work for one of the branches not in the HQ (Chicago) that those people often get overlooked for some of the open positions. Also you can not apply for another position within the company until 2 years after your start date. - One positive is that you do get plenty of exposure to the over 3,000 vendors that CDW partners with, so while it may not be CDW that will give you the chance to advance your career, there is a way to do this through their vendors.
Advice to Management
Let reps over 4 years keep some of their salary at least. This is an important thing when trying to buy a house or a car, to show that there is some concept of guaranteed salary that your reps get. This will keep you from losing the good reps that have put in 4 years of work to know the business and the industry over a few thousand dollars. Also, when bringing in new candidates and training them give them a better prospective of what an expectation from their future managers are. Too often they enhance what the job role is or sell you short on what responsibilities are.

","Pay models should be revamped. Highly successful members doing jobs well can be impacted by those on the team without the drive to meet their own goals. Because team goals are assessed, even though one can take care of their own responsibilities, they may not make full salary if others do not perform.

Review compensation models to make sure those performing their jobs well are not impacted by other non-performing team members. This is most-definitely a discouraging experience.

For the most part, management is effective, but I wish we were given the time necessary to run a more modern sales cycle. You have a building full of fresh college grads, and you want them to hammer the phones instead of asking them what they know and how they can bring the value of that knowledge to the company. The focus on stopping turnover is an old misguided concept (see Netflix practices). AM's in SLG or SMB will probably feel lied to when they think back to their recruiters saying ""50-70k a year in the 2nd year."" It's just not the case in those segments. I'm struggling. REALLY struggling. If you don't want people to act or feel like telemarketers, don't treat them as such.

A manager once told me if you arent willing to stay here for 3 years you shouldn't stay for 3 months. You really start making money after 3 years (Some people make money in a shorter amount of time).

","You MUST be self driven. For me there are no cons as I can find enough work to do to help guide associates through their ACE program while also maintaining a high billable utilization. You're given enough rope to hang yourself and must be self disciplined to work from home and be an asset to the company. If you're easily distracted and need someone telling you what to do all the time, this place is not for you. The harder you work, the more you'll be compensated. There are times you will have 60 hours of work with customers one week, and others you may have as little as 10 - and you should focus on self-educating and keeping up with the latest technology in the industry whenever you have the time to do so. Self driven. If that's even a con... perhaps the 401K match could be better but profit sharing makes up for that. Also, the health insurance deductibles are a bit high.
