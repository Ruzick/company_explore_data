- My boss and all of the associates were very kind
- I have low blood sugar and have to eat at certain times, and they were very accommodating to when I needed to take my breaks
- It is a fun work environment that encourages teamwork and hospitality
","- You have to persuade people into signing up for the store credit card, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I was taught you had to hear three ""No's"" before you stopped asking. This made some customers angry and annoyed and made me feel bad for asking so many times. 
- Regarding Covid-19, I also wish that they refused people at the door who didn't wear masks instead of letting people walk around without masks. Additionally, some associates didn't wear them and were walking around the break room when it is required to have them on, and this policy wasn't enforced as much as it should have been. Other than these, I personally felt safe working there during the pandemic, but every store is different I would assume so each person should use their judgement when it comes to that.
Advice to Management
- Keep encouraging a hospitable, welcoming, and positive work environment
- More safety measures for Covid-19, like not allowing entry if the customer doesn't have a mask on

They worked with my schedule for a long time since I went to school. Everyone is nice there too. There is more pros and cons. Friendly welcoming atmosphere, most customers were fun to talk with. It’s nice to just have a part time job here, not permanently (maybe seasonal).They give their employees snacks. They also tried to show appreciation. They do also do employee of the month. Also the extra discount that you get as being an employee is nice.
","Some supervisors there always had a bad attitude towards their employees (including hr) .There are favorites in this location. People who were brought over from another company that closed down (Toys or Us) were new to Kohls and got paid more than people who have been there for years. It’s because someone who works there brought them over. Also people who would bring families and friends, moved up more in the company because their related or friends. They got paid more too and they’re more trusted automatically. This lead to many people who have worked there for so long at the work place leaving. Ten cent raises were given per year for regular employees who have been there for a long time. You are stuck at 9$ per hour and if you’re lucky, you can possibly get paid 10 dollars an hour or more, (favorite). No benifits unless you are full time, which is hard to get.

Leaders ignore talent and education if you didnt manage people. No direct path for credit associates seeking individual contributor roles. Investing 50k in a degree should not hold less weight than someone who became a team lead with no education. Company demoted specialist roles to be less than team lead role so if your not looking to become a team lead then coord its hard to advance. Specialist should be same as TL as a specialist may want to become an analyst instead of a coordinator. Even if you have the credentials your locked into cookie cutter path of team lead then coord etc. The other path should be specialist then analyst. If you have a college degree in a related field and your a specialist seeking advancement in that field it should be allowed. Whereas a team lead with no formal education can advance.

Nice and quiet, and doesn't normally take a very long time (depending on season).
","This is a job that can and should be eventually done by a piece of software. The battery life on the electronic signs isn't great, and only a certain number of electronic signs are allowed to be shipped out and replaced per month. Eventually, there is a large amount of defective signs that rarely goes down - problem would be easily rectified if (as was allowed in previous years) the batteries themselves were shipped to the store and employees could replace them as needed. That is no longer allowed, hence a large backlog of defective signs forms (especially during the busy season).

There were employee treats and appreciation days every month. Nice people to work with. Closed Christmas and Easter. 2020 we were closed for Thanksgiving.
","This is not a company with which you can become a store executive anymore if you start from within. If you're on a career path and that's your endgame then this company is not for you. 
Basically it's a three executive structure at every store- store manager and two assistant store managers. That's the top and that's where the money is. You are salaried and well paid. The other managers are area supervisors. Those are hourly managers. Pay is OK. But not if you want to support a family or even get ahead in this world. You need to be an exec for that. Great! Wanted to move on up the chain!
But it seemed like you had no chance of moving up unless you were an intern or came from an outside source. That's who I saw coming in as training and then being shipped off in 30 days to run a store. No Kohl's experience! They would respond to these ""fiishing"" postings - manager for xxx market. It's not a real opening, but people from outside of the company respond, get flash training which is nowhere near what you need to even be an area supervisor and given a store. No posting.
There were no internal job postings for a top spot that I saw. Not that it woud matter - I still think they would forgo anyone from within and go from the outside.
Advice to Management
Promote from within. It was frustrating seeing people and hearing about people come in with no Kohl's experience and be put into one of the top positions when you look at someone you work with and think that should be their job.

Sometimes, especially during the weekdays, the store is really dead so you'll have a relaxing evening at work.
","Management is very flaky with schedules, sometimes they post updates and then unpost them so you have no idea when your actual shift is, there's always a possibility of them moving you around. This is my biggest con: management doesn't communicate with you very often about your position. I started working before the seasonal period, my work account said I was a regular part time worker. However, management saw me as seasonal and didn't even tell me I was fired, I knew from a termination email. If they had elaborated that even if I had applied before holiday season that I would be considered seasonal, I wouldn't have applied, as I am looking to work for a least a year for the experience. My application clearly stated regular part time. That is all, it was a great place to get retail experience but the communication between H2 and regular workers need improvement.
Advice to Management
Knowing that you guys have a lot of tasks to get done, I don't completely blame you for the haphazard scheduling, I just wish you would at least say goodbye to the seasonal people instead of letting them know through an emotionless email and working with them on their last day like nothing happened. Business is business but having a little kindness goes a long way.

Thu Jan 07 2021, Sales Supervisor ,,Former Employee ,Place is going downhill fast,0,"One pro from kohls is that they try to promote from within their stores. At least for their supervisor positions. Coworkers are generally nice but that would be on a store by store basis.
","Pay is nowhere near competitive with other retailers. Full timers make less than part time at other stores like Target or Walmart. You'll do twice the work for a fraction of the pay. Every quarter they'll increase your responsibilities and workload without any increase to compensation. It'll only get worse as the last of their experienced employees leave to find new jobs. 

Training is almost non existent for new employees. If hired here, expect to be lost for the first few months. Even after a year you'll find yourself learning about something that should've been explained the first day. Employee retention is abysmal because of this. This leaves experienced employees picking up the slack and becoming overworked.

Soliciting credit is the number one priority of every store. If you're not on a register, don't expect to be recognized for any hard work you do. You can have a perfectly recovered department and you won't receive any recognition. For employees that work on the registers, if you don't get credit, you won't get hours. 

Meeting arbitrary credit metrics is all upper management cares about. If your store isn't meeting goals, the stores funding goes down. This leads to less payroll for the store and reduced hours for everyone. Because the store can't schedule the amount of employees they need to keep the store up due to the reduced payroll, the store falls deeper into the metrics hole. Instead of supporting stores who are slipping, kohls will just push them down and let them fail.

As a final con, their handling of the pandemic has been half-hearted at best and criminally negligent at worst. Any precautions you see are just for show and almost all sanitary practices are not enforced. Any company that claims to have a mask requirement but tells store management not enforce it does not deserve to continue to operate.

For a couple of weeks, we were going through a bunch of courses and I personally enjoyed this insight. 
- The work environment is decent, you make lots of cool friends and meet incredible people with stories to tell. Breaks on overnights and Black Fridays were the best to distress in the break room with your coworkers. 
- Associate discount is the main thing I miss, I cringe at having to pay full price.
","- Management, sometimes you hit gold and it feels like the best time of your life. Unfortunately, people leave and others show their true colors. 
- Weird hours if you're either underaged or a college student. They have to abide to a curfew if you are under 18 so you get fewer hours. As a college student, you pretty much get stuck with closing and weekends. 
- CUSTOMER SERVICE RETURNS. I have seen the most disgusting returns of my life. Kohl's accepts anything as long as the customer brings a receipt.
- ALSO AMAZON RETURNS HOW COULD I FORGET? YOU DO NOT GET PAID EXTRA TO DEAL WITH MEAN AMAZON CUSTOMERS AND GET TREATED LIKE GARBAGE BY MANAGEMENT WHEN YOU MISPLACE A RETURN.

You can be the world's best at customer service but it only takes one old bitter lady being angry that a shirt doesn't come in blue and she will make your manager yell at you. And they do, they yell.

They're often too cheap to hire janitorial personnel so the store is DISGUSTING. It's embarrassing to work at a store that doesn't clean the bathrooms. I've tried to dust and clean up when I can but I'm too busy having to re-design sets because corporate doesn't even consider your building's layout and still demands it to be exactly like the book.

Management gives lame ""pep talks"" as the meetings but doesn't fill us in on policy updates. I feel so bad for the cashiers because they're set up to fail. embarrassing to happen in front of a bunch of customers and coworkers.

Take the up to date training seriously, it'll make everyone's job easier.
Be the example, if you're tired of ""babysitting"" actually teach them and encourage them to make it a fun and productive work experience. Don't complain to us fellow managers, we don't have the time and it's unprofessional.

Mon Nov 09 2020, Product Development Specialist,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,"Do not take the PDS position, or you will be stuck there.",1,"1.) In the aspect of technology, PLM systems are better than other apparel companies. This is primarily due to the project manager at kohls.

2.) You can meet some good people, but also to be fair, this is a pro for most companies so I wouldn't even count this.
","1.) (For the Product development specialist role)
The PDS role requires you to have a degree and prior work experience, but there is no growth for this role, despite what they tell you. You will train an intern in college one summer and next year when they graduate, they will have a position above you and will be making more money than you. I have seen it happen to multiple great employees and I have experienced it myself. 

2.) Yearly increases are a slap in the face. Manager will say that you met all job expectations but your increase will be around $1000.....OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR! On an hourly spectrum, that's a couple of cents. I have been told this is across all positions. 

3.) Lots of movement within the company, but hardly any of it is up. I have seen people work on 3-4 brands/ teams within 2-3 year time frame, but none of these shifts are promotions and they do not come with an increase. When I was asked to work on multiple brands, I asked for more money. In return, I was given around $0.70 extra an hour, and then my manager told me I was disrespectful, ungrateful, and unappreciative. Fun times. From what I heard, said manager has since been promoted since I have left the company.

4.) Hardly any diversity, high turnover, and work culture is not an inclusive environment.

Advice to Management
Headquarter doesn't care, what matters is to keep shareholders happy at no costs to humans employees at the store. Michele Glass must get her high end millions of dollar salaries, but at what cost? Abusing last line workers, who often work themselves to death before leaving few months later? Rotation of employees is a very tactical approach, as those who were not kept for longe, will eventually leave on their own, and the new employees will never have a chance to talk to them or be warned, as the wipe our happens just before new batch is hired before the Holidays. I loved shopping at Kohl's, and after resigning from my job there I never crossed the store's entrance door again, because I am simply disgusted by the behind the door politics, and treatment of people. Sadly, I am just one out of quite few saying exactly the same what I just wrote, that Kohl's was their favorite store, before they started to work there, and never again after they left. Way to go!

I have had the pleasure of getting to know some of the most amazing people and personalities of my entire life working at Kohl's corporate. Unfortunately, some of these amazing people were let go during restructuring periods for the company because the company struggles to place individuals where their strengths lie.
","DEVELOPMENT 
If you desire to further your education and have a supportive employer - DO NOT work for Kohl's. HR and upper management view an advanced education as a way for an individual to ""own their development"" and they believe that an individual should reach their goals entirely on their own without employer support. 
INTERNAL MOVEMENT
Given the restructure at Kohl's it has been an absolute nightmare for employees to get a clear understanding of where future opportunities will arise with their own career path.
MIXED COMPANY MORALS
I had an amazing boss that was a manager of a declining business. When management would instruct her to make certain decisions and results were not up to par, she unfortunately had to take the blame for their shortcomings. She was laid off while on maternity leave because her position was ""eliminated"" seems extremely odd for a company that puts such a heavy emphasis on rewarding the everyday family. I guess she will no longer be ""rewarded"" with a salary from Kohl's.

Advice to Management
After working at Kohl's at various locations and in various full and part time positions for 7 years, I can say it really depends on the store. High volume stores are less fun to work at because the constant onslaught of customers and freight really wears down everyone's morale. And depending who is in management, workplace politics can really become toxic. But if things are good, or you're able to stay detached from all that, it can be an enjoyable, laid back place to work. If you're at a high volume store they often don't fully train you. Expect to be given a 'buddy' your first day or two and that's pretty much it - and that person may or may not train you well on processes and procedures. Jobs like service desk have a lot of technical knowledge that it actually tales months to learn because there is not much formal training - High turnover makes them not really invest in someone until they've been working there 6-12 months or longer. The company generally has very loyal shoppers and a well cultivated inner culture (with the exception of some burned out and very sour mgrs) so if they can survive the pandemic and capture the millennial market I expect they'll do well.

","They work you to the bone when they know you have experience with little to no breaks. 
They pay is minimum wage, and I think even Walmart in my area pays more. Depending on the store, management can get toxic. 
If I'm ever to come back to Kohl's it will be when their pay is $15 like Targets, which is where I'm transferring into.
Advice to Management
More care towards employees that make your store shine. Treat them better. Actually help out the associates when we get *troubles*. It's not just our fault as the omni team, the entire store works together to get good numbers. So be a better manager and don't be afraid to work alongside the associates once in a while.

Advice to Management
I love working at Kohl’s. My coworkers are great. I would like Kohl’s to get stricter with the customers. They don’t have to wear masks which puts the sales associates in danger. My store has a fitting room open, and I find that to be very dangerous given the conditions. They’re extending hours and putting us in even more risk. Customers can get away with anything if they make a simple complaint. There’s also a lack of a training plan. People are just thrown on the floor and left to figure things out for themselves. I don’t know how I would’ve made it through without my coworkers being kind enough to guide me. Honestly, go work at another retail store that pays more. The stress isn’t worth it.
