Mon Dec 21 2020, Registered Nurse,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Not Worth It,5,"1) The biggest pro is that you can work from home, not just during this pandemic but all the time.
2) Coworkers are very helpful and supportive. Everyone steps up to help others and make sure no one falls behind on their work.
3) No weekends/holidays
4) Pay is good and you start with 19 days PTO per year, you get 5 more days once you hit your 5 year anniversary.
5) Small raises and bonuses every year
","This is one of the worst companies I worked for, both as a nurse and before becoming a nurse. It's so bad here that I'm leaving soon for a job that will pay me $20,000 less per year. That's how bad this place is. I would rather take less pay and be where my manager/employer respects me. 

 Management is only there to tell you how corporate is mad at you, not to actually manage and develop you. I was told by my direct manager that I would be able to move up if I didn't have a reasonable accommodation for a disability. I wonder how else they are discriminating against people.

Management is incompetent. I guess that's a prerequisite for being a manager here. They either do not return your emails or they try to make you feel stupid for asking anything. In the rare event they do respond to you, they give you blatantly incorrect answers and aren't open to their staff correcting them.

We have constant meetings for things that could be said via email which wastes so much time. Then we're asked why we can't meet productivity. Well, that's because we have at least 2 meetings or trainings per day. Come on now.
We are constantly short staffed. They are quick to hire more doctors but the nurses are so unimportant that we've been working short for years. But they expect us to get all the work done.

CULTURAL CONVERSATIONS: This is the worst. Every day, we have to have a long meeting about sharing our feelings and they expect us to share our personal lives (nope). We were given a choice between career development and the cultural conversations. Those of us who chose career development were lied to, there was never a choice. Everyone has to do these ridiculous conversations and there is absolutely no career development program.

If there are system issues, the company will mandate you stay on late until everything is done. It's not my fault you don't want to invest in updated systems. Why should I have to work until 8pm or 9pm? I do have a life outside of Anthem.

Inaccurate workflows: many workflows are outdated. When we follow what we have, we're told how bad we've done and how angry corporate is at us. Well, let corporate try to do this with being severely understaffed.

During the early stages of the pandemic, while other companies were helping their staff, Anthem is running reports to see how long we've been inactive on our computers and what websites we went to. We had to do online schooling for our kids, we had absolutely no choice. Schools were closed. We got calls from our manager asking us about our idle time despite our regular work being suspended by the state (we had no work to do for 3 months). Do they understand that we were all forced into this situation? No one chose this. It would be nice if they had a little understanding and compassion for the average working person who's just trying to make the best of this situation. Other companies were giving their staff free childcare hours from that major babysitting site, they were reimbursing for office supplies. Not Anthem. We got chastised for having to help our kids with online schooling and we got more and more reports ran to see how we're doing.

Finally, the employee stock option. We get a discount on Anthem's stocks which come out of our checks after taxes. Anthem does not give us any stocks or contribute in any way. However, they still have a blackout of 12 months before you can sell the stocks. But this is my money, not yours. You didn't finance it like other companies do. Why are you telling me I can't access my own money?

If you think where you're at is bad, please re-read my review and see if your job is really that bad. Hold out for something better, there are places better than Anthem

You are here to manage people and develop them, not just to tell us how bad of a worker we are. You aren't just here to run reports and then chastise us. Why don't you take the time to learn who your staff are and find out what their goals are?
This is a business relationship, not an ownership. I'm trading 8 hours of my day to help the company (not much longer though). The least you can do is take a few minutes to find out who I am.
Do you realize your staff is very overwhelmed? I think you do but you don't care. Well, you need to start caring or you won't have anyone left. I know so many people are looking elsewhere.
You need to start caring a bit more. We are humans with feelings and lives outside of Anthem. If you are forcing us to do these ridiculous cultural conversations to make us all lovey dovey with each other, then you should also take that advice and care about us. We are not married to Anthem, remember that. You want us to do these conversations but the managers openly discriminate against those with certain disabilities. You better fix that mindset before someone escalates it to someone outside of Anthem's HR. 

And most importantly, we are the ones who keep your company running. Never forget that. If we all quit tomorrow, you would be nothing and would not be able to function. You need to show us some respect and consideration. You are nothing without us.

You care so little about us that we don't even get employee satisfaction surveys anymore. I guess it's for the best anyway since you never really gave a care what we thought anyway and the surveys are not anonymous. Confidential is not the same as anonymous.

","Some of the biggest failures at the executive level you can imagine. Such as: 

Committing to completely unrealistic deadlines without even consulting the team doing the work on the level of effort required, then the VPs who made the commitment strongarming people into 80+ hour weeks when the deadlines are inevitably at risk. Because it’s not their poor planning, it’s poor workers... 

A total failure to implement SAFe agile correctly for a massive project, resulting in late delivery and massive cost overrun.

There are a few types at the Director/Staff VP level. You have the ones that love to talk about strategy and make promises but can’t seem to execute anything. Then the ones who are scrambling around trying to do whatever the “strategy” people decide is a priority this week. Finally, you have the people who have either burned out or given up and are just trying to stay under the radar or hang on until the next reorg.

I know there are pockets of good areas at Anthem, but there’s so much toxicity at the executive level, and it either never gets addressed or it takes months to deal with through HR. Everyone brings their baggage to work at this place.

Stakeholders are not honestly informed at what changes are happening, and the work culture has become a toxic waterfall of ""do all this programming to make everything more 'streamlined'"" and ""teach all these 'new employees' who are totally not stealing your job, how to do your job"". Layoffs are done monthly (and have not paused even throughout the pandemic, even though Anthem is making bank from COVID), and only a handful of American workers remain present at the company. 

To keep the bad press away, Anthem donates huge amounts to charities and supports human rights campaigns, all while slashing their American workforce under the guise of ""having a new vision"" and positive change. Every Thursday is now a typical layoff day, and word is that Anthem plans to move their development, claims, and design to their overseas, privately owned contracting company in India, by March 2021.

Her most common refrains are “we have to do better” and “that’s not good enough”—never leads people in showing them how. Her main skill has been hiring old friends and others who have been laid off the industry—many of whom have major ethical issues. When such ethical issues are reported, individuals find themselves laid off—and nothing is ever done about the issues reported.

","Constant reorganization of company, frequent layoffs, attempt to appear as the ""corporation with a heart"" but that couldn't be further from the truth; favoritism; promotions often based on who you know rather than what you know; some supervisors are “untouchable” although incompetent; lots of backstabbing going on. Lots of pressure to be “innovative”, but ridiculously tight deadlines often make that impossible.
Advice to Management
Promotions should be based on qualifications, not who you know. When numerous complaints are made about the same manager, recognize that there is a valid reason for that. Although I do not expect a huge corporation such as Anthem to truly care about me, I’d rather they be honest about it and not try to pretend they DO care with all the “coffee chats” and talk about “Anthem’s core values”. Cold professionalism would be preferable to phoniness.

In my experience at Anthem BCBS CT local plan, anyone who wasn't white but happened to be in a leadership position was almost without exception marginalized and discriminated against(not too worry, any local leader of color or non white nationality already left). Aside from the fake gestures of tolerance, the environment in general was hostile to anyone who didn't follow the distinct and deeply embedded racial heirachy that exists there . The white leadership at the local plan had a very public falling out with some of the black leaders there which only emboldened many of the white leadership syncophantic subordinates to act more racially intolerant. In general, if you're white you were treated like family and were part of a buddy system and if you weren't , you were always a target of any backhanded petty criticisms/microagressions. In short Anthem BCBS CT is a shameful hotbed of white privilege run amuck.
Advice to Management
If you value diversity of race and more importantly IDEAS, then you should have an open and honest discussion about white privilege and how it hurts the workplace. Hiring someone of color or a different race, shouldn't be the end all be all solution, if the attitudes of racial privilege aren't being seriously addressed and being reflexively dismissed by the top of local leadership. When the top of leadership only looks at Black leaders as an affirmative action hire fulfilling a corporate goal, then people below will take that message as ammunition to act more racially intolerant in general. Reform has to happen at the top in order to trickle down to the bottom.

Give bonuses strictly on performance and character, managers control how much money each person on their team gets and they give more to their favorite people instead of the top performers. I had all Green as far as performance and my bonus was $60. A coworker had lots of yellows and reds but because they were friends she got $200.

","Under a lot of stress/pressure to complete tasks with tight deadlines. Expected to train offshore developers that will replace your position. Management favors (Non-US citizens) with lower salaries. No valid testing environments. Politically Correct upper management.
Advice to Management
Develop and maintain valid testing environments. Do not expect your US staff to train their off shore replacements. Slow down or stop the hiring offshore staff. Just because you are allowed to hire offshore employees with lower salary requirements does not mean you should exclude US citizens from employment. In the long run it cost the company more in having to do rework of the assignments. Also special security issues, concerns and policies make it more expensive. The short term gain does not outweigh the long term expense. There are more than enough US employees to hire without looking for less expensive labor. This practice should be reviewed and seriously re-evaluated. Especially because employees can and have worked from home recently and have performed their job duties and responsibilities at or above the expectations of management and the company. Also Work From Home (WFH) employees are less expensive overall. Two or more WFH employees can share the same office space which saves the company money.

Unless you fake it to get along with certain key senior members on the teams they will brand you an outsider and let you rot in your job role. 

There is lots of criticism, no leadership, and managers tend to sit on their hands and let the controlling senior members run their teams. Although bad for employee morale and work ethic, they don't believe it when issues or concerns come up. Employees are constantly ignored for the ""inner circle of trust"" they have. There is no unity, there is no team. There is power and control

Additionally, people writing fake reviews online to ""bolster"" their area at Anthem. People don't provide any substance to what they write to give people the truth about what is going on at the company, and it gives a false impression of things truly happening.
Advice to Management
Managers and management should work with employees directly and not assume what they hear from their senior team members is true. Start looking at some of the senior members who might actually be the problem for the chaos and confusion. Listening to all of your team members would help you improve, but you must take what is being said seriously. Turn over has been high, people don't want to work in a corrosive culture. You keep people in their roles and give them unrealistic expectations to be able to prove themselves and then you go back on your word. It cant be stressed enough, stop listening or focusing on your ""senior"" members (I see what you are doing being part of that team), realize most of who you are putting your trust in are your reasons for most of your problems.

Negative Outlook
I have been working at Anthem full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
The benefits are almost competitive. Although United Health Group offers much more PTO and much longer Paternity leave.
Cons
Many of the ""Data Directors"" in Anthem have poor Data Literacy and Data skills- in facts it seems like that is the job requirement for the job. In general, this leads to poor understanding of software needed to help Analytics employees with their jobs which in creates a poor feedback structure and development of analytics across the entire Enterprise. Many people notice that Anthem is far behind the pack as far as the tools it uses and more importantly it's availability for all users. You basically have to be a VP to accomplish anything with IT regarding data infastature. In addition, anthem isn't willing to invest in IT software for the Enterprise...so many managers aren't willing to spend on software licenses for their team. It's a vicious cycle that only hurts innovation across the company and development of our analytics.
Advice to Management
Promote Data Literacy in the company by making sure managers and directors have a robust data background. End the silly and backwards culture that many VPs have regarding the development of analytics Enterprise wide. Any company aspiring to being a Tech company ( which our CEO said she wants) like Amazon or Google needs to have a forward thinking data culture. Stop using the Anthem Hack of 2015 as the excuse for not investing in analytics and more importantly not making it accessible to all. And finally, stop saying you want to hear our ideas when you aren't even willing to invest in what people say on Idea hub or even the site itself! High end forward thinking companies have a bottoms up approach to innovation( not a top down approach).

Sat Mar 14 2020, Senior BI Developer,"Atlanta, GA",Former Employee ,"Good initiatives, but bad compensation structure",4,"1. Anthem has some really good initiatives in the Big Data, AI and ML fields.

2. If you have a good relationship with your manager and prove that you are doing beyond your expected responsibilities, your manager will actively look for the type of work or project you are interested in. 

3. Lots of chances to use open-source technologies and introduce them to your work and company.

4. The work from home is perhaps the best perk. You can have a relaxed schedule, depending on your manager and as long as you complete your tasks.
","Only one con, and it's a big one: Anthem's compensation structure. Basically Anthem prefers to bring in outside talent rather than retain internal talent, so much so that they are willing to pay more to an outside hire rather than to an existing employee who has organically grown into that very role.
I was hired as a Big Data Intern and within 2 years got promoted thrice and was working as a Senior BI developer in some of the ML initiatives. But throughout my tenure, I noticed that outside hires to that same role were getting paid much more than me, and this pay gap was not something I could just brush off. I realized that the more I devote my professional life to Anthem, the more this pay gap would widen.
So I applied for other companies and got a much better offer for the same role and left Anthem.
Advice to Management
If you really want to retain talent, then please change your compensation structure. Rewarding an employee for their loyalty and dedication with lower pay as compared to an outside hire is not fair from any angle. And it is not profitable for Anthem as well, as you are losing employees who join at a lower role and learn all the internal systems and architecture. When they leave, the knowledge goes with them. 
Also, the way vendors and contractors are deployed to projects is not really efficient and is losing Anthem money.

Thu Jan 09 2020, Director,"Miami, FL",Current Employee ,Not what it used to be... unfortunately.,33,"Large company with lots of opportunity if you work in or around an office location.
","Sadly what most people have said in recent reviews is true. In addition to the new policy which prohibits people managers from working from home even though that's what they were hired as, anyone currently working from home who is next in line for a people manager position (succession planned as such), is no longer eligible unless they're willing to work in an office (if they're close to one) or relocate entirely. Many top performers do not live near an Anthem office and are now being told they cannot grow within the company unless they uproot their families to a location with an office. It's an extremely antiquated policy that does nothing but kill morale for employees who have been loyal to this company for many years. There have been countless studies over the years proving that flexible work arrangements and the ability to work from home actually increases productivity and overall happiness and wellbeing of employees. It's unfortunate that Gail does not take any of that into account. For that reason, Anthem will lose wonderful and hardworking employees to their competitors. 

My advice to anyone seeking a job at Anthem - look elsewhere. Now is not the time. Morale is at an all time low, teams are sparse to save a dollar, and in addition our company CEO is further sacrificing the work/life balance and quality of life aspect of many employees in the company. This is not just specific to my department. I work with departments all around the company and the sentiment is the same. Look elsewhere... I know I am.

","The stock price is the most important thing to the company now. They place too much work on the employees that are left in the US. They don't train well. They set unrealistic metrics for their employees. The managers are good people, but they are worried about their own jobs, and do the best they can to meet the expectations of the CEO. The jobs are now being sent to Legato in India. If you visit the web site, you will see a list of all the services they provide. And they are the services that used to be provided by Anthem's employees here in the States. Anthem no longer cares about their insured, nor their employees, and I don't believe they care about their country. It's all about the stock.

Value in your long term, knowledgeable employees is not something I experience on a daily, weekly , monthly , yearly basis.

Wed Oct 23 2019, Executive Advisor,"Indianapolis, IN",Former Employee ,"There's some good, some bad",45,"I enjoyed working at Anthem, despite some of the cons I'll list below. The annual bonus was decent (when the company met it's numbers), stock options are given for those who are Executive Advisors and above and they can be worth some money (again, if the company does well). I enjoyed my team, the work I did, the culture of the company, the mentoring, etc. It was a company I planned on spending my career at, but obviously things didn't work out as I expected.
","Here's why I left...They implemented a ""Workplace Strategy"", which sought to get remote workers into strategic locations. This caused a lot of talent to leave the company, because people didn't want to go to Indianapolis, Atlanta, etc. They then backfilled these positions will local people, many of which were less talented than those who left (less talented, also means they can be paid less!). Anthem's compensation model is outdated. They pay salaries based on the region of the country in which you live, not based on the skill or value you bring to the company. Imagine finding out the people in lower positions are making more money than you, solely because of where they live. This was a big issue for me (and others), as I was always told how valuable I was, but that value didn't mean they wanted to pay me more. Words don't pay the bills. When hired your position has an MRP (Market Reference Point), which denotes the salary range for your position associated with where you live. HR's goal is to keep people at the mid-point on the MRP or below. So let's say the MRP for your position is $70K-$100K, their goal is to keep your salary at or below $85K, and your manager will tell you, ""We have to get you promoted before I can pay you more"", and getting promoted can take more than 18 months from start to finish. Raises of 2% or less are common, even as a top performer with ""Exceeds Expectations"" performance reviews. In the end, they say they value you, but they don't show it. Their initiatives and practices end up making good people leave, it's just a matter of time.

Senior Management, most of those above Staff VP, are clueless about what actually goes on in various departments.

Mon Jan 13 2020, Senior Advisor,,Current Employee ,Demoralizing Workplace,19,"The immediate frontline team is composed of highly intelligent and dependable high-performers. Unfortunately, this isn't appreciated nor valued.
","My experience with this organization has simply been disappointing. The staff, inclusive of directors with direct reports, has been demoralized as a result of a machiavellian and narcissistic top-down management. 

It's a VP led, top-managment heavy organization who attempt to lead processes without understanding nor wanting to understand the granular details required to support the business. These VP's set unrealistic targets for performance metrics without the appropriate staff to meet the demand. Instead of taking a collaborative approach to build accurate data models with real operational performance logics, VP's assign other director-level team members to micromanage other directors and their teams to force production with limited resources and work towards meeting expectations - all in the name of the Enterprise. 

As instructed, these director-level team members, who don't own nor manage the team's operations, poke holes in processes and lead conversations via back-stabbing and unprofessional behavior composed of yelling and cursing at the Director - who manages the team - as well as operations managers, process experts, and the frontline coordinators, in hopes of ""improvement"". The in-crowd is composed of bullies with hidden agendas and when these behaviors aren't followed, VP's demote Directors and don't promote high-level performers into leadership roles. 

Anthem doesn't believe in work life balance. The day is composed of non-stop, back-to-back meetings. Being double and triple booked is normal. When asked how work is supposed to get done, the default answer is to multitask during meetings or to work at night. Many team members take PTO to catch up on work and emails. 

The teams pull all nighters including on the weekends. I witnessed a Director getting yelled at for not asking her team to work on Thanksgiving. 

This is the worst place I've ever worked at. Anthem doesn't care about healthcare. This organization is a profit-focused engine that only cares about pushing work through a number of manual systems and doesn't provide their staff with the necessary tools to do so. Avoid, at all costs, working here.
Advice to Management

Advice to Management
Your move from remote positions is short sighted and you are and will continue to lose great employees to your competitors. If moved into the many empty Anthem buildings, the expectation of working more than 40 hrs/week will no doubt continue. Staff cannot work on miniature laptops at home without the multiple monitors to work in many applications and software. During crunch times, you cannot expect staff to work way into the night and then go to their cars without adequate lighting or security guards. You are cutting off your noses to spite your faces----the productivity is going to decrease because of the inefficiencies that are inherent in working in an office. Sadly, many employees aren't going to weather the storm until the pendulum swings back to allow work at home options, and are leaving and will continue to leave. It is very obvious that the employees no longer matter to the executives

Wed Jul 24 2019, Director,,Current Employee ,"Probably good at one time, but it isn't any longer. Not even close.",116,"The paycheck is deposited on time and in full. That's the only pro of working at Anthem.
","Where to begin? The company hired many staff in the last few years under the assumption, job description, and HR interview confirmation that it was a telecommute role (and why many accepted the job in the first place), and then performed a pretty nasty bait and switch as many have indicated here in their reviews where the policy is now to rescind the work from home option and force employees into offices at ""core locations"" under the external propaganda buzzword bingo technique of ""fostering collaboration."" Some of these people impacted had only been at the company a month or two when Anthem pulled this stunt. People have families. People planned around the work from home option and accepted the job under these terms. Now the expectation you must relocate to a ""core hub"" or commute hours every day round trip for many is insane and stupid. The reality here is in many instances employees are discovering their immediate coworkers are not even in the same geographic ""core location"", and you have to use email, phone, and video apps to work together anyway, because that makes sense. Forced to commute and go into an office to ""collaborate"" with people in cubes that aren't even in the same division of the company as you, because all your teammates you actually work with are elsewhere, and probably in entirely different states. Brilliant. They even had ""welcome parties"" for this return to the office nonsense, I kid you not. As one prior poster also commented, rumors abound of senior leadership running ""badge swipe reports"" to monitor who is coming into the office and who is not, and installing sensors to track movement at desks. This has been communicated throughout the company. How Orwellian Big Brother we have become. It's pretty disgusting, and should alarm people. The harsh reality is the senior leadership at Anthem (new CEO Gail Boudreaux joined in 2018, and is implementing sweeping changes across the enterprise), and she is old-school and thus her and now Anthem's policies are antiquated and painfully regressive. Many of the worker bees in the trenches are tired of the endless ""town halls"" and ""all-hands meetings"" that are only self-aggrandizing rally sessions intended to make executives feel better about themselves and high-five each other while feeding lies to all listening about how great this place is or how well everything is performing. Anything to bolster the stock price. Under the hood, there are some serious problems brewing, but because Anthem is almost too big to fail, it can often be obfuscated for quite some time before being forced to the surface and then someone has to deal with it. It becomes exhausting when you know better. You can only listen to it so long. People are overworked, stressed out to the max, and the expectations are unrealistic and often people are set up for failure in their roles. The bureaucratic red tape and administrative headache is such a problem that middle management knows this and people nervously laugh and joke about it in small meetings when given the opportunity to vent. I've seen it. In my own experience, I've been lied to on several occasions by executives on a variety of topics, and this is the only job in my entire, quite long career where I was literally yelled, nay, screamed at by my supervisor and had my job threatened verbally on more than one occasion just because someone didn't like what they heard in a meeting. Most of the VP and above crowd are extremely cliquish, and some are woefully unqualified for their job, but got in due to the buddy system or years of tenure. Shocked me to my core to see how some leadership can behave, and can make you lose all respect for them as ""leaders"" and, unfortunately, even as people. This place can certainly border on an abusive environment. Expecting front-line workers to put in 60-70 hour weeks is the norm. Expecting you to put in Friday nights, and Saturdays, and Sundays is the norm. Do not come to Anthem, you will regret that decision deeply. I and many others are looking for work elsewhere.

","I was excited about strategically driving innovation in healthcare, but VP more focused on attending conferences, getting tagged in LinkedIn posts, and putting a lot of projects on dashboard reports than radically changing healthcare.

Most of the work is making it seem like there's real work and impact. If senior leadership at Anthem would ask probing questions they'd be surprised. 

Work isn't evenly distributed. Two people leaders push down all the work to others and take credit, and no one knows what they do. On the team, a few people have a ton of work and others have nothing to do. 

VP has never managed people before, and the people she's appointed to manage the team are no better. 

People planning to leave after annual review and bonuses.

Systems you use do not make the job any easier, they don’t provide enough info you need. And the members are either really nice and understanding or really rude and don’t listen. 2/1000 people (in the same company) you transfer the calls to are most likely going to be rude as heck or lazy and try to get you to do their job. Medallia scores are so discouraging especially if it’s a transfer call and the member is already mad at another employee and they rate them instead of you and give you a bad survey that you’ll get crap for.

I worked at Anthem full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
If you are being referred or if you already have family that works for Anthem, it is one of the best places to work. Things were very flexible at one time, with off-site work arrangements and no set hours for specific job types or departments. Anthem seems to pay really well compared to its competitors (40% more in most cases). The company seems to be very LGBTQ+ friendly as there were many people working in a professional office setting in an industry that is typically far behind the times who looked as though they would be unfairly judged and probably not hired for any serious positions elsewhere.
Cons
The benefits package is terrible and expensive for the fact that the company provides benefits as the core of its business model. The company tends to do massive layoffs every year and starts with the people with the most seniority or higher salaries. Human Resource complaints (sexual harrassment, prejudiced/racist banter in the workplace) are often ignored, covered up, and the reporters are typically ""iced out"" and eventually laid off or fired for performance after sudden changes to their work or schedule are made, in an obvious and retaliatory manner. (By the way, I am not referring to myself or anything that happened to me which leads me to my next point, nothing reported to HR remains confidential or anonymous, EVER!)

If you get on a good team it can be a highly rewarding experience. Compensation is pretty good, but has to be weighed against the headaches you'll experience below.
","This used to be a great place to work. But since Gail has taken over daily life can be equated to an eccentric yet equally depressing mix of Dilbert and Office Space. Work from home and flexibility is being eliminated at every turn. There has been substantial internal pushback by some managers who see the negative impacts of this but they are overwhelmed. Several highly talented people left (or “retired” if the person is high enough) the company in recent months. 
If you have the honor of working here get used to random and substantial RIFs. They used to be announced as Organizational Updates, but now you only find out when you go to contact people you’ve worked with for years and their email is undeliverable. 
The average professional associate is often being asked to perform monumental tasks with Lilliputian resources. Besides the RIFs, getting any sort of investment expense approved to advance a project is near impossible. Even if managers and directors understand the issue there is no support in the C Suite as Gail has surrounded herself with yes-men who will not question her. Yet for all those struggles, if Gail wants a trivial thing changed it will be ordered to be done. Anthem spent millions to accelerate their financial close in order to get her essentially estimated financial figures a couple days early. Understand this, your personal life does not matter to leadership. 
The one thing the new leadership is good at is announcing their perceived accomplishments. Typically you can witness this in the grandeur of a quarterly Town Hall video meeting. Exacerbating the issue is frequent nepotism within the upper ranks of the company. Many VPs and directors are woefully unprepared to handle their jobs but were hired as someone the CFO or CEO knows personally. Executive leadership can best be described as conceited.

Working with those good people was the only good part of my job toward the end of my time at the company.
","Where do I even begin? Transparency has taken a huge hit since Gail showed up. Re-orgs and layoffs happen now without any sort of announcement going out. The only way you find things out nowadays is through the rumor mill, which is cultivating a very unhealthy office environment. The company is blowing money on cheesy ""rebranding"" that basically involves putting supposedly motivational quotes (including one from Gail herself) on every available inch of wall space in the office. Add to that the money that will also be wasted in implementing the company's new Workplace Strategy policy that forces those near an office who were previously working from home full-time to come back into an office. This requires the company to purchase more space to house these employees in many locations. Again, a waste of money. Then there's the Workplace Strategy policy itself. This policy essentially eliminates working from home in any form and aims to force out members of actuarial and finance who are not working in a city that has now been designated an ""actuarial and finance hub"". This is all an abrupt change from the way things have previously been, where many employees (including myself) were hired under the understanding that we'd have the freedom and flexibility to establish a work arrangement that fit into our lives. However, Anthem seems to have forgotten that their employees are actually people and not just workers, so this freedom and flexibility is lost on them. Additionally, leadership has consistently ignored and skirted all of the negative feedback from employees and managers about this policy, which has now resulted in a flood of valuable actuaries leaving the company for greener pastures. And of course, let's not forget the very first announcement about the Workplace Strategy policy, in which we were all promised that the policy would not disrupt our lives when it was handed down. That turned out to be a complete and utter lie, obviously. I used to love working at this company, but ever since Gail started I have felt like I constantly need to look over my shoulder for the next thing senior management is going to try to do to screw me. Leaving was the only choice for me as the environment there has become so toxic. Morale is so low.

Everything was riddled with red-tape and pointless blocks to getting anything reasonable done. I spent more time trying to get to a place where I could actually do my job than actually doing my job. Pointless meetings made up large chunks of days. Getting things done was a political game, and you had to play your cards right and play the game to get even simple things added or changed. Rules and red tape dictated many everyday activities, and budgeting heavily dictated what what was worked on and who got promoted. Advancement within the company was made even more difficult if certain people didn't like you. 

Regressive.

Used to be an agile development with two flex WFH days. Now, we have deadlines, mandatory work weekends to meet said deadlines (salaried, no overtime), and when I left people were concerned that they'd lose their last bastion, a Friday only WFH day. Talks of replacing US contractors with overseas ones for the sole purpose of ""saving so much money!"" was especially hilarious, given that they escalated mere days before the severity of Boeing's losses due to the same behaviors came to light.

Incompetence.

Failure was VERY infrequently recognized. Many departments, mine included, would cover up failure or excessively 'focus on the positives' allowing for people and programs that should have long ago been course corrected to continue producing sub-par work. Nobody wants to admit that they could have possibly been wrong, and a pathetic childish insecurity permeates far too many decisions. Mistakes are repeated, and quality of work continues to fall. The quality of a delivered feature was largely irrelevant, the only real metric was that they ""had it"", and that it sounded buzzwordy enough to impress executives. Claims that it could be done better would be met with ""Well, we're not a tech company"".

Poor Guidance.

Developers were architects, BAs, developers, and occasionally product owners, all at the same time. The actual architects provided no guidance, and all goals were about getting X added to the project, with no indication of how to get there, or what business or tech hurdles were to be expected. Despite this, management would feel more than comfortable constantly making promises of what will be delivered, without consulting anyone who would have insight into the feasibility of that action. Work would have to be done and re-done, and it was not uncommon to have to miss a deadline or scrap a feature for a release due to a requirement unknown at the start of work on a feature blocking progress entirely.

Chaos and Zero Transparency. 

Frequently, radical changes to team structure, objectives, deliveries , and even tech stack would be learned of mere days (if even) before work began. One team in my department learned that their entire feature-set they had just finished spending four months re-platforming was going into the trash, and they would have to do it again in a new language (that none of them were hired for, no training provided). They learned of their fate from a powerpoint presentation, but at least the director of the department was in the same boat, as they also didn't know about it until that slide came up.

Promotions Through Attention-seeking/Tantrums.

The only way to move up was to constantly talk about how great you are, or to seem like you were going to quit. Only by constantly mentioning the quality of your work or by putting down the work of others could you impress management into giving you a position you likely didn't earn, and then proceed to contribute nothing of value in your new role. They had no visibility into what you actually do. You would NEVER have your work recognized on its merits, every single promotion found its way to a charlatan or somebody moderately skilled on the verge of exiting the company out of frustration.

Lies From Management.

We sure talk about our ""corporate values"" a lot for a company that constantly puts actual user experience and feedback considerations to the side in favor of impressing stockholders. You will be told that you'll get a promotion or raise ""very soon"" for months before you see any progress, if any. Promotions and raises are just keys to be dangled in your face, in the hopes that it will placate you for another week. Doing things ""for the user"" is used to inspire/coerce people into giving up their free time, more often than not for something that is actually a senior management checklist objective with little bearing on user impact.

High Turnover.

Guess why?
Advice to Management
Keep doing what you're doing. The US healthcare industry is pretty bloated and predatory nowadays, maybe you actually CAN make a positive change, by tanking Anthem. Or, if you actually want to improve, realize that in the modern age, EVERY major company is a tech company. Try treating it as such.

","Oh so many! Lack of qualified staff, leadership support and understanding of key elements needed for success. I was hired as part of the original start up team for new business entering the Medicaid market. Any new business start up is challenging and it is critical to hire the right staff with the skills, 
talents and abilities needed to be successful. Instead of being able to hire clinicians and associates who could meet this challenge, my entire staff was hired by HR without any input from the leadership team for whom they would work. Not one had previous managed care experience nor recent clinical experience. When I asked to review resumes or interview candidates I was told that it was not my job and it was company policy to be handled by HR! I had never heard of anything so ludicrous in my 20+ years of leadership experience! Plus upon hire, these employees were all promised a transition from office setting to a work from home transition within 6 months to a year. This never happened and there was grumbling from day one. The political arena was disastrous from the start due to unreasonable contract requirements and lack of understanding of managed care practice by our counterparts at the State. Extensive reporting requirements that captured meaningless data was all but unattainable. A full time analyst to build and manage these reports was imperative. However, even though my budget included both an administrative assistant and an analyst, I was not allowed to fill these positions even though other departments and directors were. The volume of work included labor intensive algorithms from the dark ages that could have been streamlined for both quality and efficiency. It was very frustrating to identify issues that were causing chaos and not be allowed to implement a process improvement. My direct supervisor, while I'm sure had some positive attributes, lacked the understanding of process and simply chose not to hear about real time issues or resulting long term effects. Instead, he chose to look the other way until my predictions were validated. Instead of providing the support needed for success, it was easier (and self-serving) to throw others under the bus. Witnessing this type of behavior was the the last straw. I did have the pleasure of working with many positive and knowledgeable people across the organization however. Unfortunately, the culture proved to be toxic. I witnessed qualified individuals from throughout the company bid for other positions or exit to competing companies altogether to escape.

Restructuring was a huge mistake. We now have people over areas that they are uneducated and uninformed about. We are consistently out of compliance with contracts due to policies by VPs who do not actually understand the work. Employees are now treated like work horses instead of human beings. Every new policy appears to be about saving Anthem money and not about members, providers, or employees. Benefits continue to get worse each year. This was a job I was happy with for years. I could have seen myself retiring from anthem. With recent changes and now eliminating work at home positions, I am job searching elsewhere. I left a different MCO primarily to work at home which was perk at anthem. It is a betrayal to hire people with the understanding that they will work from home and then change that unexpectedly. All of these changes happened after the new CEO took over. My advice is to look at the things Anthem has been doing correctly for years and start having some ethics and morals again. Anthem has gone from a wonderful place to work to being truly awful in many different ways. My judgement is that this is due to poor leadership in the company and upper management.

Tue Apr 30 2019,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Eliminating Work from Home, Poor Work/Life Balance, Employees Treated as Disposable Commodities",34,"Decent health plan (depending on where you live).

Many nice people at the lower levels.
","After being a work at home employee for well over a decade, the work at home program is being eliminated across the enterprise and associates will no longer be allowed this benefit (it's well-known that many of the executive leadership despise work at home and wear their distaste of it on their sleeve). As a result, everyone is now being forced to come in to the office even if, like me and many others, there will literally be no one in that office who you actually work with (so we'll still be working by ourselves the entire time, just now with terrible florescent lighting and uncomfortable office furniture). 

This is in addition to many divisions being consolidated down to a few key locations. If you're not in one of those cities, that's your problem. You may not get let go due to it (though you could), but you're certainly not going to be given new opportunities or move up the ladder either. 

There is absolutely zero communication from the top unless something directly impacts your specific team. The entire company is swirling in rumors because no one knows what's going on. We hear rumblings that there may be layoffs coming and then don't hear anything only to find out through various online forums that thousands were let go over the preceding months. You're constantly looking over your shoulder - 6 months, 6 years, 16 years. . .it doesn't matter if they can save money by getting rid of you and dumping your work onto someone else. I have personally been doing the work of 2-3 people as teammates leave for greener pastures and management refuses to replace them, though they keep promising (all for a sad 2% 'merit increase' each year even with top tier performance reviews).

There is no concern for employee work/life balance. I've had weeks where I've worked 90-100 hours. E-mails at 2am? Not unusual. Working multiple weekends? If that's what it takes to meet unrealistic deadlines. It's like we're expected to work around the clock, particularly if you work with people all over the country. After discussing these long hours and the burnout associated with it with my manager, thank goodness they told me it was OK, after already putting in a full day of work, to take a break for an hour or so to spend with my friends/family before going back to work in the evening (/sarcasm). 

Of course, there are other systemic issues, but the above are some of the highlights. Morale is probably at the lowest I've seen it in all my years of working here.

And, actually, as I write this I'm kind of wondering why I'm still here.
Advice to Management
There seems to have been zero consideration given to your associates when the 'no working from home' edict was handed down. Many newer associates accepted their positions with the agreement that it was a work from home position and turned down more lucrative positions elsewhere in order to have the flexibility that offered, only to have it ripped out from under them. Other associates have been long-term work at home associates for many, may years and have also accepted things like lower salary increases in order to get that work from home benefit. So suddenly changing work schedules like this is a huge disruption. Flexible schedules and work at home are important to many workers and by eliminating it completely you're alienating yourselves and making the company unattractive to not only your current workforce but especially younger workers, including those just entering the workforce. Additionally, you will lose associates with valuable skills, credentials, and Anthem/insurance specific knowledge and expertise. Whereas other companies are moving forward and embracing the ability to work anywhere if your position allows it, Anthem is moving backward. You may find other companies coming in to scoop up your best talent with more money and/or the flexibility you turned your back on. 

Stop overworking your associates. Let them have a life outside of work! If the workload takes 2-3 people, hire 2-3 people to do it. Don't dump it all onto one person until they go down in flames just so you can then eliminate them and replace them with someone cheaper (rinse/repeat). If employees don't feel appreciated, they will eventually go somewhere where they do. You may be the face of the company, but we're the ones who make it run.

Be honest and communicate with your associates. If RIFs are happening, say so. Don't hide it. Doing so is not going to make you look better; only more deceptive. You may be trying to avoid being an open book, but being a black box isn't any better.

Overall, please stop being so arrogant, particularly in the Finance areas. You're not as awesome as you think you are.

Extreme yes - especially when the workload was very unevenly distributed among teams in our department. I was working long days and hours, and another person with the same title/manager that I had, one day mentioned he was lucky to have 6 hrs of work to do a week. Seriously?)

Mon Apr 15 2019, Actuarial Analyst III,,Current Employee ,Actuaries are not valued at Anthem.,33,"Base salaries and total compensation can be very competitive for new hires.

Total compensation transparency for both your position and company internal postings - you can see salary ranges of open positions.

Actuarial study program provides generous study hours.

Decent overall benefits package - in-line with competitors.

Year-end merit raises and bonuses have excellent pay-for-performance aspects.
","New 4 ""hub"" office locations for finance and actuarial associates - all of which are in very low COL geographic regions. Promotional opportunities and career development are now extremely difficult for those outside of ""hub"" cities. Despite this, Anthem has actively hired nationwide and into work-from-home positions up until the day this was announced.

Company took work from home leniency way too far, and it is now swinging to the other extreme end of the spectrum. This is already compromising company attraction and retention for key finance and actuarial talent.

Significant amount layoffs for actuaries across all job levels - some of which were very high performers.

Non-existent office culture. Anthem leadership claims this is a priority, but little has been done to encourage it.


For actuaries in particular:

 - Anthem leadership does not appear to value actuaries nearly as much as competitors. Actuaries consistently overshadowed by corporate finance, and minimal executive actuarial representation exists other than valuation. This is a significant cultural difference between Anthem and key competitors, some of which even have an actuary as their CFO.

- No actuarial rotational program. This limits career development and promotional opportunities overall compared to competitors. No pipeline of upcoming positions openings.

- Actuarial study program provides below market compensation and needs additional pay-for-performance aspects.
Advice to Management
Value your actuaries. Reconsider ""hub"" locations for actuaries and QUICK, or you will compromise key actuarial talent. Adding four additional hubs for actuaries will not cut it - this is an extremely market-competitive profession.

Actuarial study program caters to low performers. Several aspects of the program are far too generous for associates who fail exams. Rather than ""hub"" actuaries, recognize and address this significant flaw in order to achieve natural attrition for low performers. Add pay-for-performance aspects to study program (e.g., ASA/FSA credential raise multiplied by performance review or AIP factor).

Consider formal actuarial rotational program - all of your key competitors have one for good reasons. At Anthem, junior and mid-level actuaries remain in their roles for far too long on average. This limits promotional opportunities for high performers and reduces the amount of desired company attrition for lower performers.

Continue to encourage employees coming into the office, but do so in a way that strikes a balance. Find additional ways to foster and develop the non-existing office culture.

Thu May 23 2019, Finance,,Current Employee ,Completely out of touch leadership,39,"Up until now, the option to work at home greatly increased flexibility, productivity, and work life balance.
","The recent mandate to eliminate ANY opportunity to work at home shows how out of touch leadership is, and how they are taking the company backwards and have zero concern for employees. Lack of organizational announcements when people are laid off, etc., shows the lack of transparency leadership operates with. Forcing people who have successfully worked at home for years into the office is a joke - they say it's to increase ""collaboration"" - news flash: when you don't work directly with anyone in your area in the office, you're not going to ""collaborate"" with anyone else in the office. Forcing me into a tight cube with uncomfortable furniture and florescent lighting surrounded by people listening to headphones or talking on phone calls is going to do nothing but decrease productivity, flexibility, and any desire to continue working here. Why fix something that isn't broken? Reports of the CFO team reviewing badge swipes and in-desk sensors to monitor how long you are away from your desk only adds to the new culture of employees being treated like children and prisoners. Overall culture and morale has never been worse.
Advice to Management
Re-think ridiculous order to force everybody in the office, and consider that work at home is a big (and sometimes only) reason why folks want to work here. You may think all people are ""replaceable"" (as was made clear by the CFO) but when the mass exodus hits, and word spreads about the new ""culture,"" nobody will want to replace those who leave.

senior leadership has never been great here but seems like it has gotten worse under the new CEO. we've started implementing some very questionable ethical and legal practices lately...

also, Anthem loves firing people and reducing the workforce. then they wonder why it takes so long to get things done and end up rehiring the position several months later, wasting everyone's time.

Internal goals are set very high but below what was promised to Wall Street, which results in great earnings and pops in stock; however, since unrealistic “internal goals” were not met, bonuses are reduced and your 1.5% raise doesn’t even cover the cost of living increase. If you dont get stock options when you are hired, then this is what you will experience. It is ashame because it is good place to work and I would recommend to a friend, but just be prepared to be disappointed come review time.

I have been working at Anthem full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Used to be able to work from home and enjoyed great flexibility for a work/life balance.....but no longer.
Cons
The company frequently RIFs employees near the end of the year to artificially hit their Wall Street targets by reducing Admin expenses. Not a great way to do business long term and horrible for employee morale.

We used to have great flexibility and the ability to work from home. This has recently been taken away. Now everyone is expected to be in the office 5 days a week. Despite living in an increasingly digital and mobile world, we are being forced back to the office on a daily basis. We are going backwards. Not only that, it has been rumored they will use badge swipes to monitor all employees to make sure we all head in to our cells err, I mean cubes in Anthem (prison).

The company is not being forward thinking and progressive. I no longer have confidence in the future of the company. It lacks transparency and the communication is poor.
Advice to Management
Taking away flexibility and the ability to work from home is a huge miss. Look at the giant, United, they have an abundance of remote options. Same with Cigna. The top talent will leave and we will not attract the best and the brightest......which will lead to a downfall and a bigger gap between us and United. You really need to reverse course on this......a really poor decision.

","Gail has basically made Anthem go from somewhere that's fun to work to being the usual large corporation that does not care for anyone at all. They are certainly not committed to Agile, as they will layoff members of teams at a moment's notice, force you to do everything virtually, and give no time for innovative work that doesn't involve delivering software. Additionally, Gail and Senior Management are too involved trying to get EPS sky high so their bonuses sky rocket that they've shown that they're willing to cut corners at any cost to that affect. Finally, this place is not a good place to work for any younger worker. I would avoid Anthem at all costs as they are starting to want ""butts in seats"" and do not want people working at home. The offices are grey, dull cubicles and they'll sit people who take member phone calls right next to people who do IC work.

Benefits are plentiful including time off policy. Work at home provides countless associates the opportunity to lead fuller lives, especially where teammates are spread around the country & internationally.

In this day & age I believe most would be dissatisfied & many would in fact find other employment. It has even been said that ELT has made comments that there is always someone waiting in line for the jobs associates leaving would create, which is unfortunate & moral-crushing.

Continue utilizing tools which increase production. Encourage fewer silos amongst departments & regions. Never discredit how valuable work from home is for many today to maintain any type of balance.

","Forcing people to work onsite. If you do not relocate, you lose your job. This is also a tactic they are using to lay off older, higher paid workers and get away with not getting caught with age discrimination. But I believe that is going to catch up with them some day.

Those who are working at home fear losing their jobs because many of them have children in school or seniors they care for and are unable to move, and yet their families depend on them. Not a healthy place to work.

CIO just laid off another 300 in IT, so nearly half of IT has been laid off since later part of last year. Just asking for another data breach doing this.

Unless you are in the ""in crowd"", there is no place to advance.

","Culture is shifting more so now with Gail in charge. I'm sure the company itself will be fine, but myself and half my Finance department are not going to stick around to watch it. I've been with the company almost a decade and I find it strange they bought a MCD company that was making money and having a healthy culture doing it, and now destroying that culture. To paraphrase Peter Drucker, culture eats strategy for breakfast. Gail wants to operate very very lean and thinks everyone is replaceable and things can all be driven from enterprise side. So maybe if you're in the enterprise side, the job and company are great. But from the market side, where we are handed down ridiculous targets without any negotiation or feedback on how they got there, it sure feels like we have enough rope to hang ourselves. Morale at the markets is low and people who haven't already been chopped are leaving or have left. What you're left with is a lot of corporate speak of doing well and you're doing hard work but it's all veneer and easily seen through. Mgmt is driven to hit investor quarterly targets, but making some short sighted decisions to do so. I mean... why not, they're incentivized to do so. Organization is also very flat ever since they made the stupid stupid decision to have no more than 8 levels between janitor and top CEO. I forget the consulting company (Boston consulting??) that helped implement that but most people then got title demotion and there were no more ways to differentiate top performers or offer career path for the sake of ... I don't even know what exactly the 8 level was supposed to achieve, better communication? Many employees than just languished at their position or left for more responsibilities and title elsewhere.

Benefits are no where near market competitive
PTO policy is terrible. Minimal days to begin with, days must be earned to be used (creating a backlog at year end, with not enough available during summer), ONE bump at 5 years and then you are capped for life and time can be borrowed, unless it's for a Medical Leave, which makes ZERO sense.

Non-Traditional pharmacy setting. Great co-workers. Plenty of training. The programs they have to reach out to members are well-intentioned.
Cons
An unintended consequence to all the policies, restrictions and requirements is that managers who enforce them get stuck being police; instead of hearing suggestions that could improve patient care. Screen monitoring, time of calls, aftercall work, breaks, etc. are carefully and strictly watched. Interviews suggest the position was to complete MTMs. However, reading a script mindlessly and requirements to meet call volumes eliminate any meaningful impact.

Cons
Anthem leadership in Texas are the worst. They have tunnel vision and mom and pop sized business mentality or thinking in a large corporation.

Anthem leaders has also discriminated against military Veterans, tenured employees with disabilities, pregnant women, non-degreed tenured employees and elderly women.

No support from Human Resources: Although they have an HR Department and more than enough HR Specialists; instead, they utilize a third party department of inexperienced college students to resolve ongoing and new internal issues and even legal issues. This department known as ARRT is really there to protect the company and does not support employees.

Houston Texas Provider Relations Dept is managed by leaders unfamiliar with the territory or account management therefore, has a small-town mentality and unfamiliarity when it comes to managing expanded territories such as Greater Houston/Beaumont which has caused an ongoing high-turnover in the Provider Relations Dept. This Department has a revolving door.

Management's priorities and goals when it comes to employees are dull, asinine, juvenile and does not help the company or employees grow. They will do whatever it takes to make themselves look good.

If you plan to accept an opportunity with Anthem, then plan to be exhausted.

Plan on lack of recognition and low raises which has led many employees to leave the company to go do the exact same job with a competitor.
Advice to Management
Learn what true leadership really means and actually LIVE It. Think outside the box for a change. Practice innovation. Grow a backbone and support your team.

Many of the current leaders (Texas) just aren't brave enough to innovate and reshape culture, thus too many people in leadership roles who do not belong for a successful future. Amerigroup is mediocre because it's operated by your mediocre Leadership.

Leaders, your vision is unclear and misaligned, you're constantly operating in survival mode. You will do whatever it takes to make yourself look good even if it means making your team look less than. For this, you're not Leaders, You're Dictators much like your President Trump which says a whole lot...you know WHO YOU ARE.

","As an employee who works on the Anthem Anywhere mobile application my perspective is that top talent can not be attracted because the outward appearance of the quality of software available publicly is less than favorable. Management of the mobile program is less than effective in maintaining the trust and respect of their staff because of their apparent denial of the reality of the status of their product in the market. Structural changes are needed to rectify their current procedures for managing, to success, their software projects. Realistic goals must be set and iterative process improvement made the foremost priority in order to begin building a strong team that can routinely deliver exceptional software products.

Having a large budget to throw at projects does not equate to building a team that can deliver on their objectives.

","Culture and performance were good for several years after the Amerigroup acquisition, but company is now centralizing activities to look more like United and reduce admin costs. Plan president used to be responsible for about 1,000 associates but now it's about 15 with clinical, network, and operations reporting to centralized groups.

No accountability-you are stuck fixing others mistakes. The person who made the mistake does not have to do anything. It will be you who is penalized if you do not check others work and fix their errors in addition to your work. 

Too much pressure with not enough staffing. Management expects you to get the job of 3 people done which is impossible 

Health insurance is way too expensive. We work so hard and save the company so much money but our insurance rates are out of hand. And they increase every year. 

Decisions are made without checking with the actual people who do the work to see how it would be received. This shows a lack of caring about employees.

Back when they were amerigroup, we used to have parties, outings to coney island, ice cream socials. Now we get absolutely nothing, not even a pen. A party or outing isnt necessary but it helps morale. Our morale is so low right now. Last year, over 20 people quit within 2 months. 
Upper management doesnt care about why people are so unhappy. The company will not go broke doing something nice for its employees like other companies do.
Advice to Management
Make everyone accountable for their own work.

We understand MCOs are based on numbers but if 4 people quit and are not replaced, the remaining staff cannot manage. We are only human and can do so much. Replace the people who quit, no one is asking for extra staffing. Just the people who left should be replaced.

Do things with us ""lowly workers"" in mind. Since Gail took over there has been so many changes that its ridiculous. Our workflows are being changed....without our input. Please care for your workers. We cant have one day without any changes.

Please start doing things that boost morale. Upper management really does not care that all our morale boosters were taken away. We bust our butts every single day and some appreciation would be nice. Amerigroup appreciated us and staff turnover was low at that time. Why was everything taken away? Not even an ice cream social. All we get is more work piled on and told we need to do better when we show we cannot do the work of 3 people

","You need to have a stomach for being laid off potentially every quarter by some middle management manager who would never be a manager at any other company. I had 5 managers last year and only one of those was actually in the right role. It is constant churn and nothing ever gets done. 
Data is a mess on the backend and has questionable accuracy. Never take a job here working with it. Technology is lacking and it seems every Monday when you come to work, IT breaks something over the weekend. 
They do everything they can to screw over the employees. Example, offering some voluntary program for those folks impacted by the quarterly layoffs that allows HR to pick a job for you to interview for, the catch is if you don’t take what they find for you, you lose your severance. If you really wanted to retain talent then they would allow you to work with HR to match your skill set or an open position that you feel qualified for. In working at Anthem, you need to read between the lines on everything they offer as being beneficial to you because it never is. If you are desperate for a thankless job then Anthem is your place. If you value yourself and the work you do then look elsewhere. It will never be valued at Anthem.

","Managers, supervisor, leads and some directors have less schooling than the ones that report to them and they rather give you a penny rise or no raise at all then promote you to the next level. The reviews are not fair. They make it hard for you to get above a 3. The leads are allowed to talk down to you and dare you to say something back because they know management has their back. Senior management only cares about their bottom line and not how it will truly affect the front-line employees. They don't answer their emails or letters.

Create a mentor program for those that take advantage of the education reimbursement so they are able to put the degree you are helping pay to use. They will be able to gain real-world experience and they will be able to fill those hard to fill positions you have. You have so many talented people that work or who have worked for you, but the qualifications you set makes it hard for them to move into those open positions.

","Complex matrix organisation. Working environment is chaotic with more work than what one can handle. Lack of well defined roles within a group and lot of politics from the entry level as every individual looks out for himself/herself due to that. Some legacy shared services groups with older technologies in development and testing might not be a good area to join the company. People who worked at Anthem for a while are not aware of how technology companies operate in current world due to their lack of exposure. So if you have worked for any tech companies with a good working environment or have a background in consulting, think twice before joining. No growth after joining.

Points/Occurrences don’t fall off until 1 year. They expect you to have no more than 2 absences during 1st 90 days which is not bad bc I’m usually prompt and never miss days from work unless NECESSARY. My car broke down and they did not care. I didn’t stay locally so I couldn’t carpool with anyone & had to miss 2 days until my car was repaired. After that, my son had been withdrawn from school for “residency issues” so I had to miss a day to take care of that & I was fired due to attendance. These things happened unexpectedly and were out of my control and THEY HAD NO REMORSE! They pick and choose who to give overtime to. Worked there 3 months and didn’t get a desk with ONE monitor (job requires 2..even states it in the CSR job description) until the end of those 3 months which should have been supplied to us immediately after training. VERY LOW PAY, they don’t pay based on experience so you can forget that! No opportunity to advance until after you’ve been in your role for a year & supervisors don’t approve you to be released into another position because I guess they don’t believe in growth & advancement. Don’t even waste your time. This job is fitting for someone fresh out of high school to make a little extra cash or older ppl who can’t seem to find work bc of their age. Bonuses??? A JOKE! They advertise that as if it’s really great...they even told us on our first day that it’s not much(less than $200) and that’s even if you’ve been rocking all your calls and receiving great surveys bc it’s based on the entire department, not just YOU individually. I WOULDN’T RECOMMEND THIS JOB TO ANYONE!!! This is not out of anger because I was aware of the attendance policy and knew the repercussions behind it. I didn’t leave on bad terms.

Advice to Management
Instead of choosing one that continuously requests to be an interim lead or coach, I wish management would aim to pick on associates that haven’t been in the limelight just to push them to strive for more. Instead a lot of the same people continue to apply for coaches and although they may deserve it who’s to say the other associates on the team do Not do their best and actually do work hard if not harder than the same folks that seem to get off the phones more and do less work. There is very little acknowledgment of those who do work hard and Never really get the chance to shine

","Like a lot of corporate America you have to know somebody to get ahead. The last manager I had multiple different jobs as a lead, trainer and a supervisor and was some what high brow, and unfortunately he didn't know how to recognize when to use all of the skills he had to make his employees shine. It's unfortunate because you lose so many good people because managers tend to look down on the employees rather than lift them up.
Advice to Management
Hire managers that make great employees, rather than making it all about them and how they look to upper management.

","Anthem is a very hostile place to work. They allow bullying and discrimination to take place and do nothing to help employees who are experiencing it. My previous manager even admitted on an unemployment recorded call that he did not follow up on an official complaint that I had made against another employee. Even with this Anthem was allowed to get out of paying unemployment benefits. Do not work here or pick another insurance company for your coverage.
