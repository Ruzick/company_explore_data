Excluding COVID, We have fun with co-workers and build strong relationships within the industry. Much of the industry is getting long in the tooth and priorities have been shifted so we need to attract talent to replace the old guard. Having the outings in today's environment is not feasible, but consider putting in the budget a once a month expense for suppliers and branches again. Let them remember that people are still working for their benefit, and what keeps us motivated for their growth too. We could then invite potential new employees from customers or other organizations to join once in a while to see just how great our company is to work for.

* Flexible Schedule
*Bill Amelio has been doing great despite the circumstances.
","* Empty promises. As a contractor, if they see you work well, they will increase the workload, expect you to fill in bigger roles, while remaining under contract with the same compensation. 

* Company doesn't look too promising... lost Texas Instruments, did not meet Q4 expectations . Lots of layoffs without replacements, if anything, you are expected to fill in for those former roles, again, without any compensation. 

* Previous manager expected me to work for another role, with much more responsibilities, while remaining under the same contract. As mentioned before, increased workload, forced to work overtime, and still complained about my work getting delayed. Again, this goes back to roles not being replaced.

* Not open to changes to improve efficiency. ""I have been working for 'x' amount of years, so I know I am right"" mentality.

* Typical older corporate environment, as otherS have mentioned, can get depressing at times if it weren't for a few co-workers.

*Constant changes within departments; no career advancement.
Advice to Management
Retain talent. 
Be open to change.
Learn to adapt to the current market. 
Having experience doesn't always translate to great job performance. Hire younger talent who are eager to prove themselves.

With regard to notifying employees when we learn of a positive result, we committed to doing so and have kept our commitment. Recently we learned that an employee who had been away from work and the facility for more than two weeks had tested positive, and we informed our employee base within hours of confirming this result. We’re doing everything we can to keep our employees informed and reassured during these trying times.

","Cons are that management wants to pile on work a person not the team or add higher level work but no incentives, no promotions. Unrealistic expectations from management.

Lastly management will lie making false promises to pacify employees if questioned . Pay don't expect a decent increase unless you are management or Sales.

","Management attitude is there to be a boss- not a leader. When you run into roadblocks, they tell you what you need to do even though you've already tried that. They're not willing to participate and remove those roadblocks for you to be successful.

Be a leader- not a boss. Try engaging in resolving problems with the employee for once. That's what a true leader is.

No employee retention - the direct message is “be glad you have a job”.
Awful review system, no correlation with job performance or value to company.
Raises if/when they happen are very small and usually postponed. Have little to do with performance, reviews, or skill.
Promotions nonexistent, except within management.
Trouble Ticket System (nomad) inappropriately used to penalize engineers. Negatively impact goals, reviews and morale, often a source of conflict and resentment.
Account assignment has direct impact on goal success and raises. Engineers have no say in account assignment resulting in some engineers overburden and unable to meet goals and other with light workload and easily achieve goals.
Skill, talent, expertise, and dedication not valued or nurtured. A prevailing theme of anyone is replaceable.

There is definitely the opportunity to learn about multiple sides of the business if you can become your own advocate of learning.
","No career succession or professional development plans, quarter after quarter layoffs. Ever since their failure of the ERP deployment Avnet has responded to decreasing it's overhead by getting rid of the good people that helped keep that ship afloat. They can't handle the business they choose to pour their profit into in attempt to keep hold of the market share. Instead of truly assessing the shortfall of upper management they are creating a skeleton crew on the floor. If someone quits, they do NOT replace that role and still they will choose quarter after quarter to lay off 10% of their people.
Advice to Management
Avnet has talented people, however, they are overlooked because the proper advocates for them are either not in place or those that should be championing for them are intimidated by strategic thoughts of change. Personality conflicts between senior, middle and non management are huge and frankly it's unprofessional and unnecessary. Hold your leaders accountable and dig deeper to understand fully the talent on their teams (at the individual contributor level) and exactly how the business is leveraging them BEFORE roles go up on the chopping block.

Advice to Management
Avnet is a unique company. It has been around almost a 100 years and in some ways, it shows. 
I like to think of Avnet split in half--old school and new school. 
People who have worked there for decades and are averse to change and the ones that are fairly new and embrace it. 
For the old school employees---get over it. Stop complaining about the transformation. If this new leadership team didn't come in to clean up the mess of a terrible former CIO and a passive CEO, this company would have been sold off by now. Yes, we all have to do more. That's life. Consider yourself lucky because so many others who don't have jobs right now would trade spots with you in a second.
For the new school folks--keep pushing for change. Very interested to see how our ecosystem works out in the long run , but don't forget that our traditional business is still what pays the bills.
For the sales folks--you guys are awesome. May not hear it or feel it, but you are. Thanks from the rest of us.

The head of HR needs to open her eyes to what is happening within this company. It is moving in the wrong direction and there are employees there who really are dedicated to making it stronger again. If HR doesn't start to support their employees and work with leadership, then talented people will continue to leave the company and be replaced by ""yes"" people.

While this is great to unite the company and teams around the hoped for vision for the company and its culture, it will be an uphill climb due to the disastrous SAP implementation that was implemented some time ago.
","As you will see in many other employee reviews, the company is heavily weighted towards employees, managers and leaders that have been with Avnet for 20+ years. If you do not want to be a good ole buy, then this is probably not the company for you. Worse yet, if you are gay, you can be fairly openly discriminated against and nobody including HR leadership will help you. I was asked my a senior manager many times if I was married to someone of the opposite sex six times. When I finally said I was married to another woman, she muttered what I'm sure was a derogatory comment and then refused to support my projects from that point forward. My own manager, called me into her office to review my HR file wherby she commented on the fact that I was gay and then went out of her way to discriminate, micromanage and criticize me at every opportunity. l started having panic attacks one year into the job due to the stress level. I felt completely dehumanized by the experience. I tried to get company leadership to intervene on my behalf but they were afraid of her too. . Avnet has recently hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion. I would recommend mandating that LGBT issues will be part of the new Avnet charter.
Advice to Management
Figure out a way to get your managers even in HR to be open to all sorts of diversity. Race seems to be the one that Avnet is intentional about and everyone else has to pray that their manager will treat them with respect and from a place of non discrimination. What I went through at Avnet was simply inhumane. i held in at Avnet for as long as I could and kept hoping it would get better. I spoke with HR and HR leadership and they all refused to act. You see my manager was known to be quite persuasive that most of the leaders around her felt that she was so difficult to work with that they would just do as she said.

","The managers are horrible. I've had dealings with Finance and they are just as bad as Operations. Everyone seems clueless about everything. My boss is horrible and has no social skills so I'm surprised he is even a manager. I've never been around so many negative people in all my life. There are usually one or two in a department but 70% of the department was negative. One manager micromanaged and another barely interacted with his employees. Instead,he chose to spend an enormous amount of time in his office and schedule once a month meetings. Leadership really needs to step up.

I think a reorg is in order. I've noticed that management is clueless. Departments don't have many layers. Most departments have numerous employees with the same title. Training is nonexistent too. Next time you guys have a system change, do a better job with change management. Perhaps this would alleviate the negativity. Also, listen to your employees when numerous people complain about one individual. Those people can't be wrong.

","Pay is not competitive and each one of the ""many"" reorganizations appear to be aimed at adjusting Avnet's spend in an effort to keep more margin in house. Inside sales is full of people that do not understand the technology and/or what's going on in the Data Center and as a result of poor management, are often lazy. Distribution's true defining value-add is quick and accurate quote turn around. It seems management has lost sight of Distribution's role in the Channel. Also, lack of transparency to pay plans which often change multiples times throughout the fiscal year. Very discouraging!

To the new Tech Data ownership, clean the executive leadership team at the TS Americas level and then take a more granular look at the sales leadership, from the many VP/Directors down to front line sales managers. Ensure they all understand more about Distributions and quite thinking Avnet (Tech Data) is strictly a sales org. Need to be product & technology experts and help enable the Channel.

","1. Huge good old boy network. If you're in with the “right” people you'll always have a job. If not, keep your resume updated!
2. They rely on management by fear.
3. VERY slow to innovate—especially senior management. In fact, Avnet lost ground in the market because the former CEO resisted moving the company's focus to cloud and 3rd platform
4. Wrong people are rewarded. People who've been there for years sell the same stuff to the same customers year after year and are rewarded with an annual trip to Hawaii while people who have lower numbers because they're forging new ground in emerging market sectors are left out and threatened for not generating enough revenue.
5. It's hard to get anything done because everyone operates in “CYA” mode
6.Claim to be interested in “new blood and fresh ideas,” but resist change and keep doing the same old thing—even if it doesn't work.
7. Extremely antiquated go-to-market methods and practices. It's hard to believe that a billion dollar company in this day and age hasn't invested in a marketing automation system and doesn't measure results.
8. Lots of ""kow towing"" to suppliers because they pay for marketing, but no marketing support is provided to partners, even though partners are driving sales.
9. Salaries are much lower than industry average, and benefits are mediocre.
10. Amazingly little opportunity for advancement for such a large company.

I have been working at Avnet full-time for more than a year
Pros
1) I am fortune to work with some really good people who understand the concept of team but are willing to step up and help resolve issues.
2) Leadership does not micro-manage at least not in my department. This is a HUGE plus. 
3) Employees have ownership of their accounts.
Cons
1) The national average for the position that I am in is $9,000 a year higher than what Anvet pays. What raises if any do not keep up with the yearly cost of living increases.
2) Heavy work loads. Hourly employees often work ""off the clock"" coming in early, working late, and working through lunch to keep up with deadlines. Hourly employees are also discouraged from taking vacation time more than a day or two at a time because there's no one to cover your work load if you are out.
3) Procedures are inconsistent; nothing is documented. Training is also inconsistent.
Advice to Management
Policies and procedures for completing tasks need to be documented so that those practices and procedures are consistent from processor to processor and no one is having to guess how this week it should be done versus last week.

Marketing is completely disfunctional, the management team is much more concerned with compliance than driving revenue. There has been no investment in Marketing automation, not even a system to blast out emails. It all has to go through Outlook or be outsourced.

There is a complete absence of management evaluating their team's workload to accomplish a more balanced and healthy workload.

Don't even think to bring your cost cutting, time saving, lean methodologies to the table. Even if you had great ideas that brought a better way of doing things; saving money, better accuracy, ease of doing business, quicker through put time.

Minimal supervision- not a lot of micro managing 

Great people
","Networking will get you a job more so than your skill set or ability to do the job. Due to this there's many ineffective members of management. It also makes us look inept to suppliers/customers when we're sending individuals into meetings or submitting RFs when they lack the necessary skill set. - the main problem here is that upper management doesn't know what's required and instead of focusing on finding who actually knows what they're doing they spend more time golfing- I mean talking- and making decisions based off conversations with good talkers -easy to come by in a sales type organization. 

They do not pay equally based on job titles (or sexes for that matter, women are consistently under laid here) They're also very secretive when it comes to pay scales and will also knowingly under pay employees even when there's a listed pay scale. HR will continually try to appease employees with vague responses and let management continue to go on with their indiscretions. 

They ""abuse"" good employees. Instead of creating an environment where being skilled, being efficient, being effective, and overall just doing a great job is praised they instead pile more work onto those people. It makes good employees go through a series which leads to less production, which is quite apparent on every team, but ignored by poorly skilled management. The best employees at first are angry at the fact that bad employees aren't being dealt with and they're picking up the slack, it then leads to acceptance of this throughout the organization, then eventually a lack of caring for their job which equates to poor production. Managers fix- we need more people. There were maybe 5 managers in Phx that were on board with metrics, baseline performance standards, etc but of course due to the networking atmosphere facts and statics mean nothing when it comes to making decisions for an entire branch of employees. 

It's really surprising the company is doing so well when they're managing from such a high level and there's so much waste and left over $$ on the table that upper management has seriously no idea...since the environment is conducive to covering up bad performance they focus on the wrong areas or grab such a small area to focus on so that they can show a ""win"" to upper management and upper doesn't want to hear about what they can't see in there very high level metrics they're viewing. I literally brought a business plan twice to two different executives focusing on saving upwards of 300k on just the small area of business I was responsible for and they didn't want to ""deal"" with it. They would rather lose money than put effort into improving unless their direct boss tells them to and then they can delegate it to their team...then it goes to a team of a few managers and maybe the company will get lucky and there will be one good manager with a great idea in that team, the rest of the managers will just shoot it down though because they're on the networking track and not interested in putting in any extra effort or ""work"" in general.
Advice to Management
Focus on skills. Focus on the future. Focus on metrics, consistency in performance, baseline demands from entry level employees and areas of process improvements. 

Avnet seems to be on a cycle where to save money we cut people, or outsource people, but they're not focusing on the route cause of lack of gp or decline in sales. If they made better process choices, implemented clear guidelines for jobs, and trained accordingly they'd be saving millions. This is a fact. If on the few teams I managed I found ways to save hundreds of thousands imagine if you had skilled managers with real educations in business - BA, MBA- and you had them use the education they received to make a business plan each year to save x amount of money the cost savings, the increase in morale, the sense of pride you'd put back into these teams. Right now no one thinks their voice is being heard and legacy employees have little faith in new, very unskilled, management. - I know what you're going to say we came out with a 10% improvement metric on the previous years metrics for management....that's your problem. You're still in this one track mind set where you think those metrics are the best ones to focus on, fact is they're not and because of that you're losing productivity and most importantly losing money. That's why early retirement, that's why lay offs, that's why outsourcing, and that's why good employees leave. - you're focusing and continually focusing on the wrong areas.- over the decade I spent with you I saw it time and time again. - the solution is not the small focus groups with the VPs - every manager knows that networking is going to get them their next job, so do you think any of these managers want to rock the boat or go ""against"" in a sense their metrics handed down from the person who is going to be the next person they interview with for their next position? No. Hence goes back to the number one problem Networking.

Stop hiring and promoting people you know! Half of the building shouldn't be related or a friend of so and so's outside of work before they start at Avnet. That's leading to the corruption of management and eventually this will all come crashing down in a sense. You can't keep practicing these poor hiring techniques and expect to get the ""right"" people in the right positions. Also, that's why no one wants to do better and no one puts forth any extra effort....they feel entitled to their current job and their next promotion.
