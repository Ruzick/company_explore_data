","Oh where to start, this may be because I am a temp to hire, but I don't feel as part of the company. 
During training they express how important empathy is, take care of the customer. Then hold your time metrics over your head every single day. I'm sorry, but asking someone who was recently in a car accident 50+ questions while showing empathy takes longer than the 12 minute standard they expect. The micro managing is unbelievable. Its enough to give you anxiety. Also mandatory overtime (which was never mentioned until I was through training). And not just a little, but 3 hours of overtime over 2 days. For those of us already working full time, that is a lot to ask. And during your shift you get 2 -15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch, but you have to leave your schedule up all day because those break times can change at any time, even up to 5 minutes before the break, so its near impossible to schedule a phone call or appointment. As other employees have mentioned the IT infrastructure is dated. For a company so big, I would expect less issues with the servers. They need to invest more in support. Additional training is on the weekends (which this job was advertised as m-f only). Insufficient training. And double standards, for a company to be closed on a holiday but expect temporary agents to work it, meaning there is minimal support for questions or escalations..... The pay really isn't that great. 
Too much hassle and not enough reward. If you want to invest in your call center, really treat your employees fair. If you can't do that through a temp agency, then stop using temp agencies and hire directly, there are lots of people looking for work.

Tue Aug 11 2020, Manager,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Don't waste your time,3,"If you don't mind doing mundane work for meager pay, keeping your head down and not speaking up, and finding a way to ""fit in"" with the main clique, you may have an opportunity to stay with the company for many years as long as you don't fall within one of the departments that is cut down for ""efficiency"" and so the company can still report quarterly gains to investors.
","- They don't hire leaders and instead promote those that follow the program and fit in with the current regime not taking into consideration whether or not they'd be a good manager.
- HR states there is a non retaliation policy for reporting issues or speaking up, but it's not true. If you speak up against something and call out issues within management you will be punished, reprimanded, have projects taken away, and ultimately if you don't show you're sorry enough will be put on a personal development plan until you have no choice but to leave. I have seen this done to many good associates who tried to make departments, business units, and teams better, but were beat down because senior leadership felt it was a poor reflection on them rather than improvement for everyone.
- There are many ""re-orgs"" and layoffs on a regular, even non-pandemic related basis with little to no warning to staff. Everyone is reassured it's only this one time and for the best of the company, but it happens every one and a half to two years. 
- If you have an issue with your manager and bring it to HR, they will ask if you brought it to your manager first. If you bring it to your manager's supervisor, they will ask if you brought it to your manager first. Basically, if you are uncomfortable with a situation they want you to address it head on, even if you feel you cannot, before taking ANY of the steps they've outline in their policies that are supposedly there to make employees feel like they are in a safe environment to speak up.
- If you have a brand new idea to test and run that you feel will take MetLife to the next level, sit down and shut up is what you will be told and if you do magically get stakeholder buy in, brace yourself for MONTHS of inaction.
- You are expected to work nights and weekends to make up for the lost time you spend during meetings. Almost all of your work time is dedicated to meetings and calls, so you have little to no work time to get things done (hence months of inaction across the board). This only leaves the option and expectation that you log on at night (managers will check to see if you show up on skype) and/or wrap up things on the weekend. You will burn out.
Advice to Management
There are a lot of nice policies you have created to make MetLife a positive place for employment. The problem is there doesn't seem to be any pressure to actually implement and enact them on a day-to-day basis.

Be bold and identify how to lead beyond making your shareholders wealthier. Really look at your leaders, and ask if they who you need them to be? Are they dynamic? Are they willing to let their voice be heard, or simply appease the CEO? Listen and ACT based on employee voice surveys; especially at individual department level.

Sat Jun 20 2020, Associate Claims Adjuster,,Former Employee ,Good start but don’t stay too long,2,"I was one of the individuals that was hired in July 2018 with a class of 12 or 13 people...I think. While the training was good, the job itself was not. It felt more like call center than actually solving accidents. Your typical day is in the phone queue up to six hours taking every new claim. You are graded on everything from customer service, care shops you recommend, your knowledge, and so on. The only things I did not like was trying to force a customer to go to a care shop they were not familiar with or comfortable with and the amount of claims we have taken daily. 

My typical work hours were 10:30 to 6. We have to also take a late shift which is working 11:30 to 8, and we also had flex days where you are off any day of the week but had to work 8 to 4 on saturdays. We also had the option to work from home but the supervisor I had never allowed it and gave us a hard time if we wanted to. The other supervisors were pretty chill with letting their workers work from home.

We also had these annoying daily huddles and it just throws off your work day.

This job is good only if you are looking for a start somewhere and advance elsewhere. While the pay is good, your workload is crucial. You would never be done.

Jr talent is unfortunately not good if you come from NYC banks/investment companies. Entry level talent is shockingly bad with attitudes

High turnover

Company likes to hire on false promises. Common complaint from jr analysts is that there really is no analyst program. They are promised it is a rotational program into a full time position but it is not. If you are not promoted to a senior analyst by like year 3 your are essentially done at MetLife.

Promoted based on the size of your team. So this encourages empire building even when the hire is not necessary. Which leads to a lot of people sitting around and going wtf am I doing here?

Very cheap on expenses on tools to get the job done. Basically you can't buy any software. They would rather spend $200k on workers than a $10k application.

Fri Feb 07 2020, Senior Software Development Engineer,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,"Not a tech company, as they claim",3,"MetLife offers great benefits for the whole family. They offer generally good insurance for low premiums.

There is a good balance between life and work. There are few times where the schedule isn’t 9-5, but when there are it’s usually because of bad project planning and management.

MetLife is a huge company that has been around for literally 150 years. Although the work is not always fun, there is job security and potential for long-term growth. A lot of people have been working there for well over 10-15 years.
","MetLife loves to claim that they are a “tech company” to attract software engineers, but in reality they are not. Their decisions are always based on the bottom line and never on the well-being of employees. 

In my opinion, tech companies invest in their engineers by creating budgets for learning and development. I don’t think MetLife offers any of this, but if they do, they surely do not promote it.

Tech companies also allow engineers to drive the technical direction of teams. Managers are generally non-technical with backgrounds in project management or business. Tech decisions are driven by the bottom line. Horrible Oracle and Microsoft tools are used because of long-standing relationships between them and MetLife.

Finally, it is super boring to be an engineer here. Nothing you build will have much of an impact and techs that are truly challenging to build are mostly outsourced.

Keep in mind that I worked in an app development team. This may not be the case for every engineer.

Too many good and productive employees were recently let go. Very, very political as many large companies are. EMEA better run than the Americas and ASIA.
Advice to Management
While a vendor may be cheaper than full time employees in the short term, the clients who built lasting and strong relationships with the employee who were laid off, and not due to their performance, are the ones who suffer. Customers will also suffer. Continuing to financially reward/promote employees who achieve results at all costs and then take more credit than they deserve demotivates employees who believe in and practice MetLife Values. MetLife will never have a shortage of workers. However, it will have a shortage of engaged and productive ones with a growth mindset if its senior leaders continue down a constant reorganization path.

","I dont know where to start. In short management wants everything then and there although there are processes already defined by the company. In other words they say somehow make it work.

Advice to Management
If you want to run a NASA level time bound projects sure just make the other teams and processes around it. Asking the lower level non-executive employees without giving proper process/support and making them work extra hours every single week. Well for a technical guy, they just quit and you can see the attrition rate in the team. Its a joke. So much so that every week someone will say today is my last day and we say oh ok good luck in next project as if we expect some one on the other to leave each week. And although this is an advice to management , I truly think you guys do not care either way.

Mon Mar 18 2019, Process Improvement Analyst,"Cary, NC",Current Employee ,You can't escape your rank,16,"Work/life balance is incredible. People treat you like an adult. Meaning, if you have to go to a personal appointment mid-day no one harasses you about it or demands to know where you'll be and when you'll return. No one is clocking your in and out time each day either. The end of year bonus (in March) is great and only gets better the higher your rank. People are generally wonderful to work with and helpful.
","If you are brought in at a lower pay grade you can't outwork it and move up faster. You're stuck. Even if you perform two or three levels above what you're paid they won't correct their mistake. You HAVE to leave. Also there is a huge sense of ""not my problem"" that exists in every department. People don't want to take responsibility for anything, which means there are a couple people (you'll find each other quickly) who end up doing more than anyone else. Also to get promoted you have to be incredibly nice and completely ineffective. They hate direct, honest people.

I liked my coworkers
","My goodness, where do I even begin?

First, there’s no training in any meaningful way, for anything. Tasks are just kind of tossed at you with poorly-written instruction documents and you’re essentially told “good luck”. There is a revolving door of staff that moves so quickly that I’m surprised the revolving door hasn’t flown off its hinge. Top-to-bottom, this company is a disaster.

Second, management is way overworked by their superiors so they don’t have the time to help you at all. You’re expected to just ask for help from *other* temps that joined just a couple months before you. It’s a chain of people not really knowing 100% of what they’re doing. 

Lastly, the biggest problem: every system is a nightmare. Any basic task is a herculean effort due to things just breaking at any given time, and a help ticket system that is painfully sluggish. The kicker? If you’re untrained or the systems break and tasks aren’t done perfectly or right on time, the fault is dropped on *you*. Being here was a constant, confusing circus of failure and disappointment. 

Overall, this company is rotting from the inside. It’s a mess in every conceivable way. I’m sure they’ll do fine financially though, even though morale is at its nadir. Hopefully their clients don’t find out about just how terrible of a patchwork shamble show this place is.

Wed Jan 09 2019, Director,"Cary, NC",Current Employee ,"All that glitters is NOT gold at MetLife in Cary, NC",34,"Competitive compensation and modern facilities
","If I only knew now what I didn’t know then, I would have never taken a job at MetLife. The problem lies squarely at the top of the pyramid where an impenetrable ‘circle of trust’ is responsible for the (mis)management of the Global Technology organization. The regional hub in Cary is infested with corporate politics centered around mind-games, manipulation and constant pressure from the top.
The unwritten criteria required to be a member of this inner circle is possessing at least two of the following: being formerly employed at the Royal Bank of Canada, or over 15 years of tenure at MetLife or being a male. Rather than focussing on compassionate and empathetic leadership, the priority for this ‘boy’s club’ is their egos, their paychecks, their corporate survival and protecting this aforementioned inner circle.

Don’t just take my word for it, do your own homework. Look at the share price (MET) that has been languishing in the low to mid 40’s for the last several months. The share price is the lowest it’s been since 2011. You should understand the commitment made to Wall Street by Chairman and CEO Steve Kandarian in Q2, 2016 to take out ~$1 BLN in operational costs by end of 2019. You should realize there is a major gap between this cost reduction commitment and what has been delivered thus far. You should know that management is under a significant amount of pressure to close this gap and unfortunately the only way to close it will be an ongoing and continued reduction in force/layoffs.

So why does MetLife continue to hire in Cary if layoffs are forthcoming? The corporation has no choice based on the commitment made to the state of North Carolina when establishing a regional hub in the state. MetLife is obliged to employ a specific number of employees in North Carolina in order to reap the benefits of a significant corporate tax break from the state. MetLife scrambled towards the end of 2017 to hit this this FTE target. This inevitably creates the revolving door that is MetLife in Cary today. Once new hires realize the culture they have stepped into, they make their way out the door shortly thereafter. MetLife has forced itself into a conundrum in North Carolina where they are desperate to take out costs, but want to continue to reap the tax benefits for employment targets.
Don’t be fooled by the new buildings and campus…all that glitters is NOT gold.

","Senior leadership paints beautiful pictures of innovation. Unfortunately, the transformation isn't taking place at employee's desks. When systems are ""enhanced"", functionality is lost making the same job harder and slower. We go backward, this is the norm and no longer shocks most people. The ""MetLife Way"" is a continual improvement initiative where employees are to identify and drive improvement opportunities. Unfortunately, on some teams especially where people have lingered in the same job for many years, they're very content with current dysfunction and resist change and some managers allow it. On some teams, there is excessive non-value added busy work and waste while other teams don't have the headcount necessary to perform true essential customer impacting work. It's difficult to try to encourage people to work as if they own the company because they're generally looking out for themselves rather than the company as a whole. We won't be around in another 150 years with this mentality. I've seen inappropriate candidates from outside the company hired for jobs where they don't have adequate industry knowledge which means we're probably paying too much and receiving underperformance. It seems some jobs are crafted for particular, favored employees.

","Complete change in culture since I joined 14 years ago. No longer an insurer except in the group space as a result of spinning everything off to Brighthouse. Not sure Bob Benmosche would be happy if he knew what has happened. All downhill since it became a largely a finance company since Kandarian took over. The promise of new beginnings in NC for retail was a lie. Large number of employees up and left their families and homes from other areas of the country and moved to NC. It’s clear now - those employees were moved simply to help set up the NC location and then Brighthouse happened, and they were mostly cast aside. All within the space of 2 years. Few of those Met employees can get into Brighthouse as Brighthouse are looking to build their own culture. Applying to Brighthouse in my experience ends up with an immediate thanks but no thanks email. Devoted most of my working life to this company and cared about the company, but Kandarian doesn’t care - it’s all about the shareholders with him - not the company or its employees. I’d recommend any potential applicants to look elsewhere.
