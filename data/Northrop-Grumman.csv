Give employees the option to stay with the company, not a two-year restriction on coming back to Northrop Grumman. Approximately 6,400 NGC employees are being involuntarily transferred to a company called Peraton. I'd venture to say most of those employees did not wish this. And this isn't the first time the company has done this. Back around 2010 or so, NGC sold off its TASC business unit to become their own company. Same thing, if you were part of that group, your only choices were to go on to the new company, or you could resign. But if you resigned, you could not return to NGC for a period of two years. That simply isn't fair to employees. By selling off its IT Services segment, NGC is making a corporate business decision to help their bottom line. It's what's best for them. And maybe this is one of those tough business decisions. But what about the wishes of the employees that want to stay with the company? Right now it is not clear after we become Peraton employees, if the annual merit pay raises we were supposed to get in March will come through. Or for that matter, if we will keep the same salaries as we have now. We've only been told, ""Similar pay and benefits"". It's also possible that in lieu of an annual salary increase, we may instead just get a small bonus. And the rest of the benefits remain up in the air. In the end no one knows how this is going to turn out for the employees. As companies like to use the well worn phrase, ""Employees are our greatest resource"", but I don't think in this case we are being made a top priority. Those same employees can, and some may, walk.

Thu Feb 04 2021, Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA",Former Employee ,"Turnover, Compartmentalized, Hours over Output, Mismanagement",2,"Stability - Decades-long government contracts ensure that company always has business. 

EWW - Typically available when requested.

Work/Life Balance - Work hardly ever comes home. Flexible hours. Ideal for those mid-career/with families.

Access to Public Transport - Caltrain station is >10 min walk away from site.

Strong Name Recognition - Helps boost your resume when you inevitably leave in 1-2 years (or less).
","Below Average Compensation for Bay Area

Bait & Switch Hiring Tactics - Commonplace for employees to be hired under one job description and work for over a year in a completely unrelated area.

Prison Office Aesthetic - Office spaces are makeshift compartments located deep within dilapidated, Cold War-era warehouses with little to no natural light. Combined with the barbed wire fencing and omnipresent security and cameras, the Sunnyvale site can feel like a prison (more on this later).

Poorly Equipped for Multibillion Dollar Company - Engineering laptops were in short supply long before the pandemic, with the problem only worsening afterwards. Management forced many to work onsite during the pandemic on computer tasks that could easily have been done at home. In general, technology and procedures lagging behind current industry practices by decades in some places.

Poor Project Management, Feast and Famine Work - Meetings exist not as a medium through which teammates can collaborate and brainstorm solutions but as public interrogations. Work comes either very slowly or all at once (likely due to turnover). Deadlines often unclear or can shift drastically, and the only answer managers ever have when a problem arises is to provide more overtime. 

Lack of Inter-team Cooperation and Silos - Rugged individualism is the expectation. Silos exist between teams and even between direct teammates as veteran employees commonly form cliques. These coworkers will make you feel like you’re putting the weight of the world on their shoulders when you ask for a simple status update and will often tell you to ask someone else.

High Emphasis on Hours not Output + Culture of Being Constantly Watched - Every minute worked must be recorded and reported in near exact time increments. Moreover, management requires employees to stay onsite for EXACTLY 8-9 hours, even when the workload is low. During a global pandemic, management pushed employees to come onsite 5 days per week. Teammates that grind and finish their work early can’t even leave 10 minutes early or take a 10 minute walk without fear of being reported, creating a culture of fear and divisiveness and encouraging employees to drag out their work just to meet the exact time requirements. Taking a 15 minute walk to destress feels like a crime, and, combined with the fact that work can come at a snail’s pace, manifests the aforementioned feeling of sitting in a prison even further.

High, Hurtful Turnover - All of the above contributes to an atrocious turnover rate, both at the contributor and middle management level. Because work is so compartmentalized and cross-training and documentation is so rare, individuals that leave often have no replacement, and those projects left behind often become an indiscernible mess to whatever unlucky soul is chosen to put out the fire (these unlucky souls are often the next to leave).
Advice to Management
Upper management is aware of the turnover but, rather than investing further in the employees they have and tackling the problematic culture, is tackling the solution by hiring as many people as possible and hoping that at least a fraction stay. Invest in your new employees and in training for job specific duties. Hire new employees with a purpose and a plan and don’t outright lie on the job description. Focus more on output rather than hours and/or give your employees RELEVANT work to justify remaining onsite for 8-9 hours. Focus less on small cosmetic renovations, like adding a basketball court, and more on widespread improvement of production areas and office spaces. Hold problematic individuals and teams accountable and reward employees that help their newer peers. Enforce standardized documentation of project activities and identify tribal information held between the different groups. All of these changes can be made with little impact to work/life balance but they must begin from the top.

- Job Security
- Challenging Work
- Very smart and knowledgable environment
","Where do I start.....

- Extremely difficult to get promoted internally, many leave in order to get paid their worth. If not they'll continue to get pats on the back while being over worked.

- Was rated an excellent performer for multiple years and was praised constantly by management for working on tasks that were way above my pay grade but when it came time to talk about being promoted to that pay grade I was given the run around. 

-Tuition Reimbursement (which was a huge selling point in the recruitment process) was cut from unlimited to any school to 10K without any warning. Leaving employees who started their Masters/PHD programs with the peace of mind that they would be covered now scrambling to figure out how they're going to afford it all. When we complained to HR we were told to take out a loan or only take one class a year. This hurt the morale of the early career-mid career talent pool as many of us left other offers on the table because of this benefit just to get the rug pulled from underneath us once we got here.

-Beware of the people that got their job because their relative has a friend in high places as they'll be getting paid more than you with no experience what so ever. They'll come in with signing bonuses and perks they'd never give you as you're training them and holding their hand constantly because they don't know what they're doing. Perfect example, I had a role where I asked for a telework day since I lived pretty far and I was immediately denied and given the run around. A new employee joined our team a week later and had two telework days. I eventually called out my manager's hypocrisy as I was outperforming the new employee while commuting from another state while the new employee was local and I was granted a grand prize of 1 telework day (gee thanks, smh). If you're someone unwilling to pushback on things they will continue to push your limits to see how far it can go.

-Applying to jobs internally is a joke, you have to know someone in order to get any role even if you're over qualified for the position. You won't even get the courtesy of a ""thank you for applying but we decided to pick someone else"" it's like you threw your application in a dark hole. 

-HR stinks, I brought a friend of mine to an on the spot hiring event with multiple clearances under their belt and they didn't have any hiring managers in my friend's discipline even though they put that they were looking for his discipline on all of the flyers and I had an HR rep tell me directly that 2-3 managers in that discipline would be there. My friend drove 2hrs for that complete waste of time.

-I can keep going but I'll leave the rest for your imagination.

Thu Dec 24 2020, Systems Engineer,"Baltimore, MD",Current Employee ,"Decent place to start, but need to be very self motivated",1,"Great work life balance - flexing my hours has been very useful, especially given personal circumstances. Management varies, however.

High Salary - bonuses every year and substantial pay raise with promotions.

Growth opportunities - many levels to engineering. Lateral moves are also not uncommon. 

Paid Masters - education tuition reimbursement 

Positive attitude towards education and gaining skills - getting training is often welcomed and encouraged for sharpening and gaining new skills.

Discounts - get discounts at other companies like lenovo, Dell, Samsung, Apple, and many more. Not that impressive as Amazon has better deals and it doesn't drop the price that much. Just an added perk.

Lots of great things about the company. Work-life balance is by far the greatest. Working remotely, flex hours, and 9/80 fridays are a huge benefit.
","Lots of slow days - some days will be fast paced due to deadlines, however there are many slow days. As a high performer, this becomes discouraging and depressing. I almost always have to ask for work; sometimes I charge time for no work being done

Less work for young employees - a lot of time, we're given menial work as younger engineers. It felt as though I didn't do much and I got a promotion, which felt weird. It seems like this was more of an attempt to keep me working for the company to combat their high attrition rate.

Quality of workplace highly dependent on location - I work as a Pathways engineer. You get 3 rotations before deciding where you'd like to station yourself. My first rotation as a systems engineer was more of a secretary, as I managed file organization, offered tech support, and supported/maintained a completed engineering project. At my next rotation, I worked on data analysis and coding. Same title, wildly different responsibilities.

Passive aggressive management - applies to above point; depends on location.

Lack of transparency upon entering Northrop Grumman as an employee

Mixed bag of employees - most are welcoming and friendly, however I have met quite a few who are prejudiced and judgemental. It has made me question my place in the company and industry as a whole.

Paid Time Off (PTO): no sick days, but get paid time off, about 13 work days starting out (~100hrs). You can go negative if you're sick, but that means as you earn PTO hours, you're basically paying back a PTO debt. During covid-19, PTO can drop to -80 hours and then future accumulated PTO pays off this negative balance over time.

Unstable industry - funding can turn off and then management scrambles to find you work. It can be very irritating having worked on something for a long time and then get interrupted for months at a time until program funding is available again. Recently, NG lost a contract and some people are looking for new jobs within NG.

I have had mostly poor experiences here, and perhaps I feel disgruntled in writing this review. There is a reason NG has a high attrition rate, especially with younger engineers, so maybe then this review is justified. My coworkers and I occasionally vent to each other about how we are not very happy with how work is going. I'm one person, so make sure to read other reviews and take this with a grain of salt. 

This could be a great fit for you, but just not for me. I don't do well in slow paced environments and need to feel responsible for more work than simple tasks. Understandably, junior engineers need a learning mindset and patience, but it seems ridiculous to me how little work I have for the salary I'm paid.
Advice to Management
Give more responsibility to junior engineers. This is a time of our lives when we are looking for challenges and to learn a great deal. I don't feel challenged in a significant way and many coworkers of mine and I feel like cogs in the machine. 

Also, monitor prejudice and rude office behavior more. It's impossible to force people to change their view, but at least reaffirm that employees keep controversial and hurtful opinions to themselves and outside of the work environment. I don't expect everyone to agree with my faith or accept me, but I hope the idea that I should be respected in the work environment is a frequent reminder to employees.

","-Absolute neglect of proper health and safety conditions at the facility in Sunnyvale. Employees who can do their work in a sufficient manner working remotely were required to come into work 5 days a week on my direct team. Most of our work is done using computers sitting in cubicles, yet there was zero flexibility despite senior leadership saying so. If remote-capable workers are required to come in 5 days a week during the worst part of the pandemic (3% ICU Capacity), why is it that management seems to be absent from the campus? 

-The Sunnyvale campus promised to have a running dashboard of people in isolation and positive cases but no sign of updates after the initial powerpoint 2 months prior.
 
-Management is severely out of touch with the actual employees doing the work. Excessive back-and-forth just to relay the status of work or to confirm a problem. The actual people with technical knowledge are treated extremely poorly. Management hires based on nepotism and do not have a good technical breadth of the work they are conducting.

","Overall I love the company; I've heard there are a few crummy jobs or bad managers, but this is a MASSIVE company and you can likely find a good role with a good manager

In my role, the hours are sometimes demanding and the work / workload can get VERY stressful

Also, while I am compensated well, I feel that I do bits and pieces of other roles and those people somehow get away with not doing that stuff.
Advice to Management
Keep up the great work! Continue to invest in in the happiness of your employees. Continue to push the boundaries of work/life flexibility to allow for unique schedules. Continue to improve your employee resources (such as training and development) so that your employees feel empowered and have the skills and knowledge to do their very best.

","Avoid the Mission Systems sector. This sector:
1. lost most of the leadership that made it a good sector to work in
2. created a huge matrix based management bureaucracy that consumes any profit from the actual engineers and doesn't do what it was created for
3. uses stack ranking for performance reviews (a quick search will reveal articles on how bad this is for high performing engineers)
4. Lost most of its training budget due to the cost of the matrix. People who want a company that will pay for their continued education should look carefully at what the company offers.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the matrix bureaucracy (where it exists) and restore the training budgets so engineers can keep learning and remain expert in their fields. Get rid of the poisonous stack ranking performance system, which all the smart companies like Microsoft dropped because they realized it was hurting them and costing them top employees. Overhaul the management at all levels, requiring non-direct staff to show how they contribute to the company's health or earnings or move on.

","Company could have provided bonus/hazard pay for critical employees who cannot work from home during COVID-19 (national security, manufacturing, etc), which make up a large percentage of the company. Some groups of employees are very understaffed, while other groups are very overstaffed - organization as a whole has difficulty balancing hiring to scale up with their projects, which leads to poor load balancing across the staff (unfortunately common at very large companies.)

","During my time at Northrop Grumman, none of the new hires were allowed to work from home even when the work was completely on non-classified computers. They were also not allowed to work a flexible schedule. There were 5-10 covid cases per week, most of them in the building I worked in. About every 2 weeks, my lead would hold crowded in person meetings for all the new hires, which lasted about an hour, not give a skype option, and told us to not report how many people were in the room. 

Whenever I gave any notice to my manager about an appointment that would cause me to be late to work, he would say that it's fine in an email, then afterwards, schedule an in person meeting with me and tell me verbally to never get to work past 8am. He would then pry into the details of my appointments and say he was not able to tell anyone because he is bound by HIPAA. He would frequently call me on my off days. Not to talk about work, but to pry into my personal life. I eventually went to ethics regarding all of these issues concerning both my lead and manager. I was fired 4 weeks later. 

We would get monthly emails from the CEO, telling us how much she cares for our safety. However, several members of leadership had proved otherwise.

Compared to other defense companies, Northrop Grumman is lacking in benefits. There are no yearly bonuses and health insurance is more expensive. They also don't give very much paid time off.

","Most jobs are bait & switch — no one on my team thought they would be doing the work they are doing. I hear the same from other groups. I have applied and interviewed for 4 different roles here and each role had completely different tasks/assignments/responsibilities than what was discussed and or posted on the job listing. 

Access and equipment issues are constant problems. Either you don’t have (working) equipment, the software, the software licenses to do what you need to do or you don’t have the access/permissions to do what you need to do. By the time all of this is sorted out, the task is over/dumped and it’s on to a new task with these same issues.

Bottle necking of work — many people with little to do or are waiting on data to go forward. See people online all day or talking / not busy. Then there are a few people who the work bottlenecks through and they are always swamped and work crazy hours.

Poor communication — upper level will know it needs certain info or tasks done weeks ahead of time and won’t mention it until a week or even sometimes a day or two before it’s due, then mention it. After people work / stay late, holidays, weekends trying to complete something they should have had weeks to do, the results are trashed or not looked at and this happens a lot.
Advice to Management
Hire people who actually want the roles/tasks you have versus bait and switch—this will help reduce high turnover and keep people more motivated and interested in their work.

If you know weeks / months ahead of time that you will be getting an an employee or intern, start the process of getting permissions/access and equipment going instead of having people sit for weeks after starting without anything.

Also, there are a few bitter older employees set in their ways that are pretty rude. Stay away from them. NGC is losing a lot of talented people due to burn outs. Either they don’t see it or they don’t care

-If you like it freezing cold inside (like long pants and a sweatshirt with the hoodie on and your feet are still frozen), then this place is for you
-Nice, well-kept campus that is brand new
","-You will have to park at either GE or FIT Aviation
-You won't have a desk with your name on it, ever
-Security is an absolute JOKE. FIT has 10x more security and they aren't a defense contractor: if another country had agents go on NG's campus, they'd own it since there is no armed security and employees are not allowed to have weapons in their vehicles, not even pepper spray. So if you don't like having a target on your back by working here and compound that with no security, then look elsewhere. (e.g., I was sitting in the building one night and heard 8 consecutive gun shots outside, definitely gunshots. I asked ""security"" about it later and the guy simply stated ""yeah, I heard them."")
-You will be given your assigned tasks but you will have to find the resources to complete them (i.e., play hide and seek to find a computer and phone to be on a phone call). This is because it will take months to get a computer and phone at your desk (again, IF you get a desk).
-Basically, this whole campus is like a chicken running around with its head cut off: no one knows how to get you in for training for something or who to contact or when they do it or how they do it. It takes weeks or months to get anything done around NG because no one knows anything.
-Also, if you think you get paid more by having a clearance, think again. I took a pay cut by accepting an offer at NG from across the street, which also included a promotion...how do you get a pay cut with a promotion across the street?? And you also get to deal with all the BS that a clearance gets to afford you.
Advice to Management
Maybe start valuing your employees instead of seeing them as pawns or objects that will accept whatever circumstances you throw at them, because I won't! You hired way too many people for the buildings and the campus. No parking + no desk + no computer + unrealistic expectations = no employee. I've had several jobs, and somehow at a multibillion-dollar defense contractor, I feel the most undervalued.

It still can be if we turn it around with the right leadership, while we still have our company reputation (and contracts) mostly intact.
","Good and stable technical, functional, and program leadership has widely been forced out to make way for ""diversity"" candidates. The irony is this has resulted in much younger, less experienced choices of replacements who are themselves very ill equipped to manage a diverse workforce. They are struggling with their own jobs, particularly with the technical aspects of it as well as the finer points of genuine employee encouragement or measured discipline rather than the standard ""check boxes of managing people"" they get from various avenues of training. In many cases they assign themselves prime technical work to learn from, while neglecting real incentives for the older more experienced folks who are left with no choice but to either work under them or quit. They are selfish and they are not capable of communicating consistently or directly with their direct reports in meaningful ways. And this was before COVID-19. They do not incentivize them or form relationships with them, and they treat them as a means to an end, only. The result is they tend to isolate their older reports rather than engage them. In some cases, I have witnessed some management referring to older workers in general with derogatory language. This has left an entire technically proven and capable group with an unmotivating, defunct career path, since there is not room for them to also continue to develop technically nor develop along the leadership path. 

Functional and Program Leadership is broken because there is not a strong relationship chain among leadership. So even the capable leaders who do exist, particularly on programs, cannot function as such to their own direct reports because they cannot even trust their own leadership chain. 

I know first hand of many folks over the age of 45 who are on anti-depressants or seeking personal counseling because of this prolonged way in which the company has been mistreating them. In the last few years, I know of at least one case, possibly two, where additional personal or family issues have pushed someone over the edge and resulted in the loss of job or life. It is unfortunate that a once great work environment for career minded folks now is a place to also be survived rather than a place to thrive making top products.

Sun Jul 26 2020, Software Engineer,"Cincinnati, OH",Former Employee ,Avoid NG Xetron at all costs!,7,"- Co-op Program helps UC students get an idea of what to avoid in industry
- Will sponsor a clearance (and then let you sit in a windowless room in the back for months until finding a project for you)
- Pay is attractive for area engineers who have no idea what a clearance makes you worth
","- You will never see your manager. Not only is it complicated as to who actually helps you get promoted (hint no one but yourself), but the only constant is the goals that NG sets nationwide.
- The work was disappointing. Obviously you can't discuss cleared work here, but I was led to believe my job would be much more interesting than it was.
- Mentorship is laughable. Now I'm not expecting things to be handed to me, especially because Google is your friend. However, if I ask questions about something that I'm new on, I shouldn't be jumping to literally every cubicle on a team in an endless round of ""ask Bob"".
- Benefits are lackluster. I honestly think they take advantage of people straight out of college by dangling big numbers and cool job titles, but your insurance terms are bad for the industry and got continually worse while I was there.
- Office space is depressing and too small for the needs of the company. We had full-time employees sitting two to a cubicle because NG HQ never authorizes Xetron to rent new space. Every once in awhile an executive deigns to come out to the sticks to see us, but our continual pleas to just rent more space is always denied. At least the people leaving are helping that out for them, but it's a simple problem with a simple solution that shows how the bureaucracy of NG fails their people.
- No emphasis on employee health during Covid-19. This is what drove me out. I had a family member symptomatic after coming in contact with it at their work and they still wouldn't let me out until I begged their medical staff in Baltimore.
- Management is a good old boys club. They have their favorites who worked on contracts with them over 20 years and trust them implicitly. I've seen decisions and opinions take a complete 180 in the span of a month because of what someone on the inside is. You may aspire to grovel until you join them, but I'm telling you there's better out there.

In summary, I honestly believe Cincinnati is the location that Northrop Grumman forgot. Lack of office space, poor management, engineers dropping off poorly run projects left and right. All for ""mission"" work that turns out to be very different than what they tell you they work on. I want to believe NG outside of ""Central"", ""Ohio"", or whatever they call it now is better. The bread and circuses from popcorn, donuts, and the occasional scraps from lunch meetings isn't cutting it. There are better tech firms in the area to work at, you don't need that clearance outside military or DC-area work, and this place should be avoided. If anyone avoids making the mistake I did when I came here then the time to write this was worth something.
Advice to Management
Cincinnati - Do better. Sending 6 people to Black Hat, putting out the same three foods every week, and constantly puffing out your chest about ""mission"" do not keep people in your doors. The letter that the head of this site sent out last December trying to wave away the retention problem shows that you know it's happening, you just don't care. 

NG - Please find a way to root out the good old boys in the upper middle management. Their toxic influence is a solid majority of the problem at this site, and the other problems could better be solved without them. Your senior engineers who do the real design and patent work are easy to identify and they're the ones you have to keep. Until then, the rest of us are going to keep stopping in for a year or a year and a half and finding better pastures elsewhere.

Advice to Management
Listen more to your workers than you do shareholders. Increased production speed plus little training equals low quality. Simple. Please provide time and resources for training and reject the push for day-and-a-quarter. It’s not healthy for people or the business and quality has suffered greatly. You talk so much about Quality yet your actions seem to show you really couldn’t care less so long as Schedule is met. Please get your act together before DCMA shuts down the line for continued violations. And, the constant shuffling of managers to various cost centers did not help worker morale, produced confusion, and should be halted. Also, there are some people I worked with who spent literally 3-4 hrs a work day on their phones. They don’t care and should be let go asap.

And, the constant shuffling of managers to various cost centers did not help worker morale, produced confusion, and should be halted. Also, there are some people I worked with who spent literally 3-4 hrs a work day on their phones. They don’t care and should be let go asap.

When the economy is good, this practice backfires, I know amazing talents who got upset and quit. Of course management initially doesn't care, there are good enough talents to deliver a project and the managers to get their bonuses without the super talents.

Sun Apr 05 2020, RF Engineer,"Rolling Meadows, IL",Former Employee ,Northrop Grumman,6,"In full disclosure, it has actually been over a decade since I worked at Northrop Grumman. I used to have a different, more negative review up, but decided to change it to this one. The passage of time and working at a handful of other jobs has shown me that NGC isn’t a terribly bad place.

In this 90,000 person company, it really is a crapshoot who you will get to work with. But, in my experience (I worked in the Baltimore location for 6 months and in Chicago for 2.5 years), the managers and mentors I had were the best of my career thus far. I didn’t recognize or appreciate that at the time, since I was fresh out of college starting this job. But now I can see what a huge huge benefit that was.

Also, starting my career here, there were a lot of people the same age as me, and I made a lot of friends, many of whom I still keep in touch with today, over 10 years later. Several of them even came to my wedding. I have quite a few good memories from this time.
","The thing that drew me away from NGC, and why I wouldn’t work there again, was the big company aspect. Everything moved at a glacial pace. I was there for 3 years and wasn’t seeing any advancement at all. I felt like a tiny cog in a huge wheel. If you work there your entire career, which some still do, someday I’m sure you could advance into some high level management or technical positions, which are hard to find at medium or small companies. Personally I just didn’t have the patience for that.

One other thing was the office environment - cubicle farm/messy lab. Worst offices ever. I have described it as working in a windowless basement. Usually I wouldn’t complain, but it was just very sad to be spending all your time trapped in these rooms.

Finally, the pay was pretty bad! Raises were minuscule, bonuses non-existant. I was right out of school, but still... didn’t take too much to lure me away.

Decent salaries if you negotiate well. The ability to work a 9/80 schedule (9 hour days with every other Friday off) is the only reason I continue to work here. Good job stability - it seems impossible for them to fire people here, even when they are terrible at their job.
","Senior management is always sending out announcements patting themselves on the back for ""listening"" and ""caring about"" employees, while their actions continue to reflect the opposite. The campus has been under construction for 4 years with inadequate parking. I have to walk nearly a half mile (in the street) or wait 10-15 min for a bus to take me from the parking lot to my building every day. Despite the employees being very vocal about these issues, they fall on deaf ears. Employees were promised a new campus center building with childcare, dry cleaning, and a gym. None of that happened due to senior management poor budgeting/planning. They ended up just planting more grass in the center of campus where a parking lot was desperately needed. Additionally, the way they've handled the COVID-19 outbreak has been disgraceful. They held off on instructing employees to work remotely for as long as they possibly could, when other defense/tech companies in the area had already been working remotely for weeks. They lied to the media in their press release when an employee came down with the virus. They said that they sent us all home ""in an abundance of caution"" yet more than half of the campus still had to report to work. They pretend to care about employee well-being but they don't. I'm just so tired of the lies. In all honestly, they are a giant corporation who, at the end of the day, only cares about the bottom line.

Stop lying to employees, we can see right through the fake caring persona. Keep the promises that you make. And most importantly ... BUILD A PARKING GARAGE!

Cons
First, there is no formalized training here. Presumably the company's solution, from what I've gathered, is that I am to be assigned to someone to learn alongside them. However it took weeks for that to actually happen in my case. Even then, rather than formalized points of contact, I just have a loose list of people I should talk to, all of whom are always busy and react to my questions with short patience at best, outright annoyance at worst. Independent training is all but impossible. I have tried using internal resources to shore up my understanding, but such information either doesn't exist, is scattered into some database I haven't heard of (this is an issue my manager has been having as well), or is out of date. Routinely I'd find a relevant piece of information, go to learn what I need to be doing to complete my job, and only find broken links when I actually go to investigate. I'm given conflicting information on how to handle problems, often by the same persons. What finally pushed me to write this review was an issue happening again: being told by an advisor to contact one person for information, then being told off for bothering that person and not knowing better that I should have been able to do it myself. This is even worse when I was, in fact, fully capable of doing something myself but was given incorrect information, that I -had- to go to someone else. Routinely being made to feel foolish, told I'm ready to launch meetings despite missing crucial components, the utter lack of training, all being made out to be my fault, makes me want to leave immediately.

Talking with other new employees, it seems to be a problem they aren't having. Reaching out to other friends in related STEM companies and laboratories, however, to people who share my demographic background, my experiences are sounding more universal. I have regrettably come to the conclusion that a lot of the talk of the company about inclusion is empty. It's something that sounds good on a corporate headline, looks good in trade magazines and news publications, but even if it's the official position of the company, it's not reflected in the culture. It's a Defense Contractor, this is probably inevitable.

My takeaway is that if you're a typical white male, you'll have no problems here. You will likely find a wonderful career. If you don't fit the model of the majority, your coworkers will be cold towards you.

You need to back up what you say are your corporate ideals. HR hasn't responded to my emails, my manager's hands are largely tied, and the corporate culture will not change while you're making such training sessions and HR programs optional.
