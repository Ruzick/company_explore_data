Tue Feb 09 2021, Sales Supervisor,,Former Employee ,A Learning Curve and An Opportunity,0,"The office environment is largely a good combination of collaboration and camaraderie, with great ""extras"" that come along with being in office (lunch and learns, vendor sponsored happy hours, etc.). There's good opportunity to grow your paycheck if you're willing to grind for it and build customer relationships. With hundreds of vendors heavily invested in Synnex, many reps get great opportunities to go on trips, excursions, and classy dinners quite frequently to honor that rapport building for the brands they serve. Experience is highly valued, but so is performance. Synnex makes certain to honor individuals through awards, spiffs, and other means to ensure these individuals are rewarded properly. The company recognizes both college grads and 20+ year industry experienced individuals well, as they recognize that success is a daily thing. An infamous mantra of “what have you done for me lately” lives at Synnex and does a great job of showing that the company appreciates the past success (whether 10 days or years), but that today is a new day and chance to continue to be great. Synnex is also consistently willing to listen to what they’re employees are saying if they are in good standing with the company. Synnex is also arguably the most stable company I will ever work at, managing to keep just about all of their staff through the 2008 crisis, and hiring many people in the midst of a pandemic. It’s a very secure job once you get it, and the company is very open about finding positions that best fit you and your skills, so internal movement of jobs is often an option. Dennis Polk is a CEO that deeply cares about the fundamentals of how the business runs and why, and so far is the only CEO who I had more than one in depth conversation about the successes and failures of the company. I started as a sales rep and moved into a supervisor role in my time there, so something to be said about opportunity to advance as well.
","The big catch is that there’s a serious issue with Synnex on the sales enablement and education side. It’s difficult to reach that high performance level that gets rewarded for most individuals, as the environment is infamously denoted as “sink or swim” when it comes to learning the job. These shortcomings of education include, but is not limited to, utilizing internal systems, understanding escalation paths, executing unique processes, allowing ample time for learning, coaching, and overall evaluation of performance. This is often left to the experienced reps and supervisors of the floor to help fill in these gaps of the knowledge, rather than selling to hit their own lofty sales goals (if you’re lucky enough to have one on your team, be sure to thank them). This often leads to reps and management alike to be generally overwhelmed and overworked. As Synnex’s line card increases, so does this disparity of information that ultimately causes many of the newer hires to leave (which is why turnover is rather high, especially in Western US offices). Many may argue that this grind is part of sales type positions, and while I agree, I find that Synnex’s grind ever increases, with management asking for more and more, with little compensation to counter offer their employees (and managers) with. You must have an entrepreneurial spirit to survive at Synnex, to thrive, you need to be a little lucky too.
Advice to Management
If I'm honest, I think the at the core of the issue is a structuring of the business as a whole, and just needs a whole revamping, but if that's not feasible (likely isn't) the learning process for new hires must be rebuilt. The current system is rigid and rough on new learners with little forgiveness and margin for error. Start by creating preset 30/60/90 plans to set concrete goals in LEARNING ONLY in the first quarter they arrive, then once they've created success there, pick out some accounts and give them some background on them, and ask them to create an attack plan in 24 hours (to learn pressure) with a 30/60/90 plan they create for their own success metrics. Have them present to management, have management evaluate, adjust, and approve. Evaluate them against their own word, and then let them run. While not a total solution, it at least gives new hires a chance to learn and grind out some of the finer details while not making management hugely overwhelmed.

Sat Jan 05 2019, Manager,"Greenville, SC",Former Employee ,From Bad to Worse,6,"There are some great people who work there. It is the ONLY reason I stayed as long as I did. The company has a history of industry trust, which makes employees feel stable.
","- The company is CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Automatic answer is no to almost any request. I understand trying to be good stewards of the organization, but cheapness is so ingrained that it causes progress to stagnate. Example: As a Manager, it took me 3 months, and dozens of conversations with 2 levels above me to get approval for a $300 expense that was necessary to accomplish team goals. I had no authority to make decisions.

- Compensation is 20+% below the industry, and increases are almost impossible to come by. Example: The company believes that regardless of your role, you should not get more than 7% for a promotion....THEN they make you ineligible for a standard annual increase the following year. This minimizes your promotion to the equivalent of about 3-4%. 

- Outlook is questionable.... New CEO took over less than a year ago and the stock value has dropped over 40% since that time. Polk was the former CFO, and is a extreme micro-manager with an eye on the smallest tactical detail, and fails to understand the scope of his role, with an eye on strategy. 

- Overall, I'd say the focus of the company is that the dollar is king and people are a necessary evil.

","They are still running a business out of the 'dark ages.' No CRM tool so you end up calling on accounts that cold have been called on by 20 other people in the company the week before.

Mon Sep 25 2017, Manager,"Greenville, SC",Current Employee ,"Good company, But needs to improve in a few areas",2,"Very approachable management and exec structure. 
A well-respected organization in the industry, 
My direct manager is supportive and invested in my success, 
Profit sharing is a nice perk (but also a con, see next section).
","Total compensation is good and bad --- example: industry salary may be $50k, the company may pay you 50k total, but only 44k is guaranteed salary, the remainder may be profit sharing or some other non guaranteed comp. Which means the employee is taking the risk that the company may deny these one year because “profits weren’t great” (which hasn’t happened in my tenure, but still is possible).

Company cheap in other ways: 
- Will spend $100+ in man hours to debate reimbursement of a $10 expense, not a good use of company resources. 
- Systems and tools are an in house system that isn't intuitive, often seems to be programmed without the end user in mind.
- Outsources a ton of support resources to China and Philippines (to a company subsidiary) and it is very time consuming and frustrating to communicate with non-english speakers on complex issues, as well as difficult to schedule communication as there is a 12 hour time difference, which means people often have to take meetings in the evening to account for this. If you communicate via email, it can take 24 hours to get one communication cycle complete, sometimes takes over a week to solve a simple problem that could have been taken care of on a single call if the person was in North America.
- 401k and Tuition reimbursement are stuck in the 80s ---- way low compared to most corporations. 
- Not a lot of autonomy for employees, relatively small decisions and approvals have to go up 2, 3, 4+ levels of management before employees can move on something. Very time consuming and makes the company sluggish.

Fri Jan 27 2017,Anonymous,"Fremont, CA",Current Employee ,Salary not competitive,4,"Management is flexible with work hours. High stability/job security and the company continues to grow with quarter to quarter profitability, Fortune 500 company. Accessibility of senior management and executives. decent health and child-care benefits (though 401k is subpar), no micromanagement
","The biggest issues are as follows: Salary is not competitive with the current market, in fact it is at the very bottom end of the spectrum. Lack of growth and career advancement for someone looking to move up within the company. Stuck with an old school style of business, lacking a rich company culture in any sense of the word (9-5 clock in and out). Low morale, pretty much every long term employee is just stuck on complacency mode and not really looking to improve the work or the company culture. 

Other issues involve: Lack of mentoring or even basic training for employees. Operation processes are very manual, lacking efficiency. Most processes involve internally built computer software/programs that lack innovation--can hinder growth if you're looking to learn, especially if you plan to one day move to another company that uses a widely accepted/distributed platform or software. No remote (work from home) opportunities (old school mentality).

• support departments have been very helpful
• decent health benefits and offers a bonus structure
","• Salary for position is well below market value, raise this year was half of previous years even with same high productivity numbers 
• lack of promotion opportunities to progress career
• as an operations manager or supervisor you’re expected to be on call 24/7, 365 for security issues – get called in the middle of the night and have to go to building to reset security alarm
• company is trending to hire externally for management positions as opposed to promoting internal top performers
Advice to Management
Management needs to look at local and national averages of salary and realize they offer well below market value, if they offered at least equal salary they can retain top performers and recruit top tier employees. Promote employees that perform at high levels and who are looking to progress their career, if you’re looking for career progression in distribution center management Synnex does not offer many opportunities to advance from the position you’re hired in as – if you are someone who only wants the position you are currently in and don’t want to advance you’ll be happy here. Overall a good company, but with low pay for the responsibilities of a manager and a lack of long term career advancement, I would not recommend seeking a management/supervisor role with Synnex in distribution – even if you wait out those in positions you’re looking to obtain, you will probably be passed over for an external candidate which I’ve personally experienced.

Expect to be paid $5-7K less than the industry standard for any position. Their claim to fame is ""diversity"", however once you look beyond senior level managers, certain races become highly represented while ""others"" have always been ""non-existent"".

","SYNNEX is full of office bullies. If you are not a ""brown noser"" than this is not a place you will be happy working. I had a lady whom made it her daily mission to make my time there difficult. I did everything in my power to be accepted by her, even spent $40 on a b'day gift for her. (If you are hated by someone you don't buy expensive birthday gifts, but I wanted so much for her to treat me the way she did the other girl). There was a chart of responsibilities handed out by upper level mgmt. I had to beg for my work on a daily basis. It was so bad I kept record (emails) of every time I asked for my work from her. She would give my work to another employee she liked better. It got so bad that I was doing another dept work because she wouldn't hand the material I was responsible for over to me. One day I approached her in a professional manner about the issue, and she turned childish. She ran to management, who was aware of the situation and said several times they would handle it, and whined. This lady disappeared from her desk for over an hour. Our superior came out and went looking for her. Couple of hours later I was told that whatever he had previously said regarding fixing the obvious favoritism situation was now going to be handled by everyone sharing the work. Might I add that I never did the other employees work, she only was given mine. Also, the responsibilities was handed down by headquarters in Freemont, CA, and should not have been changed. Needless to say, if you aren't ""in"" with the brown nosing.... Chances are they will fire you for missing a couple of days! Days that were covered by sick time, even had sick days left over and vacation time they had to pay me for....explain that one! The woman who didn't like me, had me pushed out the door 2 weeks after I confronted the situation. Might I add that it was the Legal dept., the same position they are hiring for now. Be careful. The benefits are nice, but the office bullying isn't worth it!! Oh yeah, the said reason I was let go was because I was late, another thing...the boss and I had agreed I could come in at 9 instead of 8:30 because I NEVER used an hour for lunch. So, I was instructed to take a mandatory 30min lunch break, and I could work from 9 to 5:30... Go figure. Guess anything is possible in a ""right to hire/right to fire"" state.

","Heavy Micromanagement
Unachievable quotas - And I was there for years but as you progress the goals get to level that are unattainable unless everyone's business is growing at 20% levels month over month.
Heavy Metrics - Call volume, emails, sales quotas.
Low pay - The base pay is extremely on the low side and the commisions and bonus are not consistent with the size of deals and levels or work done to close them.
Long Hours - Consistently working 9-10hrs daily.
No Career development - There is no clear career path here. You will need to get promoted by building strong internal relationships.
Advice to Management
Develop your sales representatives with training and promote from within for top performers. At a certain point motivation to achieve such high sales quotas is not enough to keep the team performing at a high level.

","Despite very strong performance, if a manager didn’t like someone on a team and wanted to see them gone. And they didn’t have the authority to fire them, but looped the employee out of emails and conversations, talked poorly about them behind their back, and disregarded any good performance. Not only is that unethical, but it also made actually getting team’s work done way, way harder.

In team meetings, some managers would treat one person like a hero and another person like a total loser who wasn’t doing anything right and was going to bring the team or even the whole business down. It is a talking full-on hazing in a group setting. Not surprisingly, there wasn’t a lot of substance behind why an individual was being praised or hazed so much; it was just a management technique.

There were days that no one cares to talk to each other or even knew employee was there, not to mention the bullying that occurred. 
Being severely underpaid for highly competitive position, working long hours to prove yourself only to lose a promotion due to nepotism.

Managers proudly saying “they don't need to justify their decisions or actions."" Experience (or position) should never win an argument. Wisdom, logic, and judgment should always win--regardless of in whom those qualities are found.
Advice to Management
Treat each other with respect. Not only do employees who create a culture of gossip waste time, time is money and better spent on productive conversations. Most of all gossiping cause other people to respect their co-workers a little less--and anything that diminishes the dignity or respect of any employee should never be tolerated.

","I just escaped from a full-time job in a toxic work environment and I can see why so many friends of mine have given up on the corporate world. In the job I just quit, the best employees quit and the worst people got promoted to management jobs.
The people with all the ideas were shunned and pushed aside. They didn't stick around. The tush-kissers with no ideas got promoted and spent their time in meetings, talking about their upcoming vacations. (I know because I was forced to sit through a lot of those meetings. They were excruciating.)
I was naive. I tried to stick it out and help the company succeed. The harder I worked, the worse I got treated. It was hard to leave the company I had worked so hard for but the minute I was out of there, I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders. Now I see that I was deluding myself when I thought maybe things would turn around. The culture is totally broken. It's not going to get fixed unless there's a change at the top of the organization.
Advice to Management
Why do the company promote people who aren't remotely qualified into management positions? It seems like the worst thing they could do because there's so much riding on those management jobs. You would think they would be more careful about making appointments for management positions because of the risk to the company if they put the wrong person in the job. If you pay attention in any fear-based environment you'll see that the people at the top talk a good game when it comes to business results but what they really care about is protecting their own turf and their own power base. They would much rather see the company collapse around them than to admit they were wrong, or admit they have no clue what they're doing.

So I want you to think about this right now and ask yourself if some of your best leaders are using gossip, rumours, exclusion, favouritism and, unbeknownst to you, creating divisions in your ranks. Do you hear the water cooler gossip? Do you hear rumblings about employee unhappiness under a boss who you thought was great? Is their diva behaviour, for example, going on that causes others to react negatively? Remember, there are those leaders who have the right attitude towards others and have a team that’s consistently happy because they use fairness. In your organization, you can be sure that you have inclusive leaders and some of those bullying leaders who use exclusivity to divide and conquer. Can you afford to let those disguised leaders exclude and take away from your bottom line? Putting this on your radar screen will save you a significant amount of grief and money.

","Like always, there are some good people at every company. And this place has some which I had the pleasure of working with. However, overwhelmingly, my experience with the people I worked with in the Canadian offices is as such:

- Micro managing is at a level I have never seen before in my 20 years in the workplace.
- Management doesn't take any blame for strategy and execution. Instead, blames their employees to cover their own jobs. Some of the really tenured ones come off as really insecure in their decision making. Sometimes setting you up for failure on purpose. 
- High turn over in non management positions. 
- Management lacks diversity in Toronto and Guelph office. 
- Constant stress to perform as compoany is obsessed with growth in an industry that's very matured and probably on decline overall. Growth is expected without any real leadership or strategy other then beating the prices of competitors which doesn't get any sales reps paid commission.
- Most management and many employees routinely throw each other under the bus and it's a HE said, HE said game. Most likely due to a trickling of micro managing down the chain of commands and the pressures to grow, at really low margins with little room for error. 
- Really outdated office (Toronto). Dense sea of cubicles. Old building lacks upgrades. A bit embarrassing to hold meetings for visiting customers. 
- Compare to previous companies, feels top heavy on directors whom focus on micro managing most of their days rather then big vision tasks.
Advice to Management
Inject more diversity into management (especially in Guelph and Toronto office that reflects local diversity). Hire more people oriented managers that can mentor instead of only looking after themselves. Replace leaders that are out of touch with the changing workforce and realities of today and instead live in a small town/suburban mindset while trying to operate an international company in a big city. Focus less on results and more on how to attain those results, and not by micro managing, but by real and genuine people coaching. Get rid of that obvious chip on your shoulder as a company who seems like you are obsessed with trying to become the 'popular kid in school' but coming off in-genuine doing it.

- You'll be part of the elite group since getting in is very difficult the management is very picky on who they will hire.

- Once you hit the big time(stumble on a big fish/client) you can get commision up to 5 times your salary or more. 
- Unlike the other reps who's tied up on answering inbound calls, you on the other hand will be your own boss on managing your time between calling out and emailing would be clients.
","- Once you hit the big time, you will need to watch your back constantly. Many superiors, colleagues and even newbies will be on the prowl and waiting for you to make a mistake. Because if you do and you leave, they will devour on your carcass(clients) like a flock of vultures and divide among themselves your hard earned client list. 
- Since you're measured by your sales, many reps skip breaks, lunches, some come early and most leave late in an effort to finding that ultimate client that will make them their ""million dollar sale"". Problem is, management does not agree to pay you overtime in sales department. They justify it by saying, we do not require you to work more than your regulars hours so if you must, you will be thanked. Thus the word O.T.Y. is born, meaning, overtime? Thank you! :-) - management.
