My advice to management would be this. I very much appreciate you hiring me.

In this day and age, people can come and go to most any job, but will stay if there are solid leaders. I didn't see that with this leadership team as they lack the knowledge and skills to lead such a big organization.

Fri Aug 23 2019, Accounts Receivable Analyst,"Lincoln, RI",Current Employee ,Turn Around,4,"Coworkers, and benefits. Not much more to say here.
","I’ve worked at UNFI for a little over two years now and since the merger everything has gone south. No one seems to know the company’s strategy since merging and upper management keeps employees in the dark every step of the way. Empty promises are made and the resources provided are extremely limited. The organization is known to under pay across the board and there’s little to no training so new hires are expected to figure out their role within 1-2 months or they’re gone. Turn over is extremely high since the merger so don’t get too comfortable with your co workers. I wouldn’t recommend any position at UNFI and there’s hundreds of others that would say the same. UNFI is stuck in their past successes with no tangible plan moving forward and if a plan is underway - employees are unaware.

Advice to Management
I'd like to note that although I kept quiet about what happened during my internship at SuperValu when they got bought out by UNFI, there were so many inappropriate things that happened that I wish I knew were HR reportable at my time of employment. It was never communicated to me what types of things were considered harassment and as a college student, I was unfamiliar with what was and wasn't HR reportable. 

 I do not recommend any college student to take on an internship with this company. This company brought me down career-wise by ripping up every shred of confidence I had left. As management won't care to teach you anything useful about the business, will make you do stereotypical ""intern"" office work, and will treat you poorly by talking down to you. Your time here will be wasted surrounded by unhappy people who don't have the time nor want to teach you anything insightful.

My advice to management: be open-minded to new ideas, train your employees properly so you don't have to micromanage them, & keep inappropriate comments to yourself. Your interns take on this job to learn, grow, and scope out your company for future job opportunities, treat them as your equals, not as kids who should be doing all of your ""grunt"" work.

","Where do I start? This company bought my company out and it's been nothing but downhill since. UNFI is clearly a company that does not value their employees, they see us as numbers on a sheet of paper. The CIO showed up in our offices in December and pretty much lied to our face about what to expect for layoffs, all while touting how ""transparent"" he is being. 2 days later people started getting 30 day notices. Keep in mind this is maybe 10 days or so before Christmas. If this isn't enough to tell you how poor the top leadership is... keep reading.

The concept of working from home is rocket science to these people. The CEO and the CIO value the optics of seeing people sitting in their desks over actual productivity. They don't know how a modern IT shop works.

The most childish part of this leadership is the CEO's award he gives out quarterly. You'd think an award that comes from the CEO would sound like an award that comes from the CEO and would look good on a resume right? Nope, he hands out the Mr. Pickles award. It's the laughing stock in our office. Apparently there is a deli in RI called Mr. Pickles and the CEO had really good service there once so he decided to make an award out of it. Because a deli that doesn't even exist in my state is somehow motivating?
Advice to Management
If you want the credit for being transparent you should actually try to allign your actions around your words. The CEO and CIO (as well as certain VPs) have zero credibility because you told us you'd be transparent and your actions were as transparent as a brick wall. No one trusts you nor takes you seriously. 

When you show up and start laying people off, the adult thing to do is to tell us what to expect. Instead you showed up, shrugged your shoulders and said everything would be just peachy. 

Might I remind you, that as an employer you are competing for my services. You might be a big fish in a small pond in RI, but in my state you are a small fish in a very big pond, and we have plenty of options. If you value your talent (and let's be honest your actions indicate you don't) you'll make a complete 180 on your behavior. I'm not holding my breath.

","Not enough diversity, There is not one person who has any ethnicity in management in the whole building. There is no room for advancement.

","They say you don't have to complete the 4 month probationary period if you reach the set numbers for two weeks in a row. I met those numbers in my first two weeks of work, and have continued to reach them. I received an offer letter for a full-time position and even PTO. I still have yet to have been brought on as a full time employee - MEANING, they send me home when there isn't enough work (everyday). I had to use my PTO days last week to ensure a decent paycheck for my family. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. No employee should have to use their PTO just to ensure an 8hr work day. I work on average 4hrs/day. Some days, I drive the 40 minutes to work, and get told there isn't work and am sent home. I have spoken to my union steward AND superintendent about the issue and have continued to be told that I am next on the list to be hired on. This shows very poor management. If I wanted to work a part-time position, I would have applied somewhere that was offering that. Instead, I applied here to work full time + overtime (what was promised) and am really working a mere 25hrs/week if I'm lucky.

","Hopkins procurement mindset is work harder not smarter and profits over people. Management expects to see you in your cube before and after business hours to “prove” how hard you’re working. Do not question authority, the way things are done, or why processes are inefficient. If you haven’t been here for 15 years, expect to be talked down on, bullied by upper management, and have work continuously added to your plate for no recognition, promotion, or additional pay. The phrase “the better you get at your job, the more work you get” is a favorite amongst leaders and is very true. Become good at your job and you will be given more and more work with no additional pay.

The bottom line is they simply don't care what the retailer wants if it doesn't directly contribute to sales. All feedback from department Directors and lower is ignored if it doesn't directly effect the sales dollars of the department. You will not be listened to. You will get grand statements of vision and direction and no action.

All departments within the technical services group are extremely isolated. There is little to no inter-group communication all which leads to the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. I would not recommend working in any of the technology departments in this company.

Also the new warehouse management systems that you are putting into your warehouses might have its benefits if you view the warehouse from behind your desk but to the people that actually use it everyday, it was a big waste of money and made their jobs harder. Maybe you should have asked your employees what they thought about the system, or would that have been to considerate?

This team puts in countless hours on a daily basis to provide groceries to your pantry, and are the real heroes. The drivers who work odd hours and drive for miles and miles, and the order selectors who lift thousands of pounds per day. I love the focus on corporate social responsibility and philanthropy efforts. 

The benefits are pretty good and the wellness program ensures lower cost of premiums. The tuition reimbursement program is amazing to continue your education. The product discount is also a very nice benefit.

The equipment and facilities for the most part were very good. Ergonomic standing desk stations, new trucks, and decent lift trucks. The company events and prizes were good.

Top notch Transportation Department, Safety Team, Supervisors, and promotion opportunities from within.

The HR department kept managers consistent for the most part.
","The region's senior leadership team would make the ground shake when walking through the facility. The fear that was bred into the facility to execute tasks or be removed was heart breaking. There was no inspiration, no motivation and definitely no appreciation from them towards staff members. Frequently resources were restricted, expectations increased, and power was used to manipulate the local management team to carry out dirty deeds or apply unnecessary pressure. The current General Managers plays into this cabal of senior leaders flawlessly.

Order Selectors beware - Mandatory 16 hour shifts were frequent only with the expectation to show up the next morning and do it all over again. No plans were ever discussed to improve the working conditions for the warehouse. 

Always hiring! You can always find a job here due to the astonishing turnover. This is not sustainable and shareholders carry the expense of costly turnover. Why do people seek to work somewhere else? They want to be treated like people and have positive relationships with their managers, to be respected, and have work life balance.
Advice to Management
Understand what is actually going on in your facility by going there and actually getting out of your office to speak with people. Start fresh by finding new leaders that value their people on a personal level and remove the toxic group of non-value added untouchables. Focus on collaboration not isolation and you will find your employees will be more engaged, and excited to work hard each day.

The company store does have a good selection of breakfast and lunch items at a reasonable price. The fresh fruit is absolutely tremendous,
","Most of IT management from managers on up are splendid examples of the Peter Principle in action, or rather inaction. Any creativity or free thinking of any kind gets quickly squashed and buried. Micromanagement to the sub-atomic level is in full force. Trying to get information on how or why systems are designed will usually get you one of two answers, The most popular answer is “I don’t know.” The runner up is most often “Well, that’s the way we’ve always done it!” New employees get no trading at all, so it’s either sink or swim. Forget about a training budget- it just does not exist. Turnover is so horrible that it’s laughable. Anyone that you run across that’s even mildly competent is planning to leave. Guaranteed. Retention is definitely not part of the game plan. They are more than willing to let what good people they have leave then replace them with the first warm body that shows up, usually in the form of a contractor. Far too many contractors in my opinion. The contractors I’ve work with there however, are for the most part amazing. Multiple advanced degrees seem to be very common. A good Education is very important in other countries, more so than in the US. These guys (and gals) are very hard workers.

* stores seem to be confused about what we can and cannot give credits on. Actually they just seem confused in general about most of the contract.

","Too much work, no support from management, high school like environment regarding rumors and promotions, lack of teamwork and respect, difficult to communicate with other departments. HR and Management are two faced and don't have your back. At first, I thought this was a good opportunity but then realized your just a minion in the company and hold no value. I worked my butt off for my customers and felt as though I was the only one who cared at the company. I went to upper management several times for serious problems and got little or no help. The employees they hire for the warehouse and customer care are not professional and don't care. Supervisor is inexperienced, unintelligent, didn't care and only did things to make herself look better. Manager ALWAYS had their door shut. Very high turnover, lack of training and no room for advancement. At least 3 people fired or quit a month in one department alone. Also high turnover in HR which isn't a good sign. Attendance policy extremely strict and they will make no exceptions no matter how good of an employee you are. This place will give you experience but I wouldn't stay longer than a year or two.
Advice to Management
Focus on employees, provide more support from management, hire more people to lighten the work load, change the attendance policy, make it easier to communicate across departments, Reward hard work, more focus on customers.

Executive management has been in disarray for the last two years and this is not changing anytime soon. Turnover is very high under the new ""leadership"". HR is so weak it is laughable. I would not recommend this company to anyone at this point. To say the atmosphere is toxic would be the understatement of the 21st century. 

If you decide to go ahead and interview anyway, take notice of the demeanor of the employees. This should be your first sign that this is not a good idea, no matter what the pay. Second indication should be the transient nature of the very top leadership. Inquire as to how often the highest level is actually present at the Corporate HQ. I doubt they will tell you the truth, but, the CEO spends about 10 days there per Quarter. No wonder why there is such disorganization. Third, ask about turnover. They probably will not tell you the truth here either but people disappear from this organization without explanation. Fourth, ask them about their IT ""systems"" and watch their eyes glaze over in fear. Performing even the most simple tasks is an exercise in futility. Lastly, do your research online as to how the senior leadership has taken care of themselves (compensation) at the expense of lower level employees recently. 

After all of this if you decide to go here anyway, good luck as you will need it. Don't walk, RUN away as fast as possible.

Advice to Management
Start actually caring for your associates instead of acting like they are all expendable. Return to the culture/environment that made associate's enjoy, care, and be proud to work at UNFI. Instead of the prison it has become. Your values and cultural needs to change or the company will continue the downfall that has already begun. The HR department needs to be reevaluated they are terrible at best because they just don't care and that's from a management view. I could only imagine what the associate's think and feel.

Wed May 11 2016,N/A,"Providence, RI","Business Analyst in Providence, RI",Gap between pay and skills becomes depressing,14,"Hands down the best group of people I've ever worked with. I made life long friends here and learned so much. This is a great company to get your foot in the door and develop skills from the ground up. There is very much of a collaborative environment where you are encouraged to ask questions and push your limits. But really, at the end of the day what made it for me was the team. They made coming into work something I always looked forward to.
","Where to start? For starters, the atmosphere and cultural decline. There were multiple layoffs which makes a noticeable impact on moral. Teams were expected to move at the same pace while lacking in resources. Individuals were often times taking on responsibilities of multiple roles while being told from leadership that working 80+ hours was expected. Benefits have been slashed year by year. At this point there's an ongoing joke on when the free Thanksgiving turkeys will be removed from the benefits program. Raises are minimal at best and have dwindled every single year. Top preforming teammates won't even get close to cost of living at this point while being told we should count our blessing that we even have a job. There's been talk of removing yearly merit increases all together. Once you sign on with a certain wage, you'll be locked in, even if you get a promotion as they're only allowed to increase pay buy x %. While I mentioned earlier that it's a great learning opportunity, the gap between skills and pay as the years crawl by becomes more and more, to the point where an employee could easily double their pay should the move to a different company. 

Pay and benefits aside, there's also the day to day life. Procedures are minimal and documentation is close to none as most teams are expected to move at a pace that simply doesn't allow for the time to document anything. Deadlines and expectations are set by executive level leadership without an understanding of effort involved, leaving the actual team scrambling to meet deadlines to avoid being marked as failures. The work is almost sometimes unrealistic and teams often times create products that are sub-par due to the lack of support from the higher ups. Not being able to finish a single project, or worse, delivering a product that is less than what the team could produce due to unrealistic expectations is demoralizing. 

Promotion won't happen either, unless you know the right people and are of the right personality type. Show interest and they will ""train"" you for years on end, giving you managerial tasks under the excuse of prepping you for the role while you maintain an associate title and salary.
Advice to Management
Provide a budget for training and please, stand up to executives when they're demanding unrealistic goals from the team with an unrealistic deadline. At least consult with your team before you commit.

Thu Jun 09 2016,N/A,"Providence, RI"," in Providence, RI",RUN AWAY! Run far far away!,16,"Nice office building.. thats it.
","I accepted an offer for an administrative position. I had 2 other offers I turned down for this job. I took the job because it would be an easy commute for me. They only offer 5 holidays per year which is pathetic in my opinion. The vacation time is also lacking. I was hired and before starting I let management know I had 2 previously scheduled days I needed off for medical appointments, they said it would be fine. Unfortunately the early am before my 2nd day of work, there was a fire in the basement of my house. I called my manager to let him know I would be out on my 2nd day because of the fire, I got his voicemail. 

I then received a phone call at 11 am that same morning telling me that he was terminating my employment! I was fired for having a FIRE in my home! THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CARE FOR ITS EMPLOYEES. I was treated with zero compassion or empathy. I was told I was being let go because management didn't like that I had two future days I would need off - even though it was approved before I started. The 2nd reason he said I was being let go was because he thought I was ""living closer"" - I had just bought a home in a different town then what was listed on my resume. I think firing someone based on where they live is discriminatory? Those are the reasons he used but its clear he was annoyed because I called out my 2nd day. I'm sorry my house caught fire!!! I was there one day and in that one day it was easy to see many employees are not happy at this company. The fact that I was let go for having a fire speaks VOLUMES about the culture at this company. RUN!

Mon May 23 2016, Certified Pharmacy Technician,,Former Employee ,Unappreciated and no advancement,3,"The staff and customers were typically nice people, and the computer training was efficient. It was also convenient to be able to let customers shop so you have time to finish prescriptions.
","The staff did not always appreciate their employees or convey important messages to others. (They often yelled at employees for changes they never told employees about, etc.) Extra work is often given and it can be a challenge to leave on time. If you use their training program and become certified, it doesn't make a difference. The wages are the lowest I've seen for pharmacy technicians and there is no room for advancement. Extra work is not appreciated, but expected. If they are short on technicians, they expect hired technicians to pick up the extra slack, and are not always respectful of the time it takes to study for classes.

Pharmacy technicians are hard to hold onto when they are paid extremely low wages and there's no room for advancement. I would suggest more frequent raises and to create positions such a 'lead technician' or something along those lines.

Mid level management is a joke, director level associates with TERRIBLE communication skills are the norm. Zero support despite months and months asking for help.

Advice to Management
The idea of management should be all about mentoring and promoting and moving up. I don't see that happening under the current management. They don't want to lose any good employees. So they are not prone to training and promoting. My last store director was all about mentoring. His goal was to raise up leaders and ship them out. He found joy in doing that. I think that is what keeps a company thriving and current! No fear of the future. Living in the now. I miss that management style. Especially since I have been trying to get trained for quite a while now so I may be promoted. It is not happening for fear of the manager losing their job to a fresh face who costs a little less to keep on board. I am currently looking for a new job that is full time with benefits because of this reason. I have been in my current position for about five years.
Although the career opportunities are great at this company, it really depends on the management at the store you work at. So my ratings below are based on individual store management style.
I have not had direct contact with the CEO of this company so I have to review for him.

Hire a firm to come in and do an assessment. Then actually follow their recommendations. The negativity and backstabbing at the VP and C-level trickle down to the everyday employees. Take that one VP who you KNOW is bullying people out in the parking lot in Providence and fire him in front of everyone. You need loyalty. What you have is a people mill that burns through employees like kindling. For an all natural company one would expect better.

Fri Jun 06 2014, Anonymous,"Mechanicsville, VA",Current Employee ,A challenge that will make or break you.,0,"-Start out pay is good; 15.20 an hour (once qualifications are met - 16.20 an hour).
- Great place to work for any person that is up for challenge, change, and motivation. 
- The goal (the motivation/requisition of an order selector) is to meet the daily/weekly average. There is an incentive bonus added to ones overall pay that is based on your weekly score. Minimum score requirement for the week is a 95%.
- There are tons of opportunities to grow, learn new things, and work you're way up. 
- Supervalu is one of the top highest in revenue grocery distributors in the U.S. This assures it's employees of job security. 
- You basically work alone.
- Fast paced environment. There's not much time for chitchat or any drama.
- Guaranteed 40+ hours (as of right now) a week.
- Fellow employees are very cool and easy to get along with. I will say that Supervalu has done a great job in finding the people that they need to fulfill their requirements, but they also have done an even greater job in finding those who are compatible with others.
","- Tough work environment. It is slightly dark, dreary, cold, and claustrophobic in the warehouse, but it comes with the turf. Keep in mind that it is an old warehouse.
- The perishable side needs a lot of work. The isles are confusing to new hires and it's on the verge of becoming a safety hazard. 
- Concrete floors are cracked and uneven; making it hard to keep product in place when commuting from isle to isle. 
- Long work days (good or bad; depending on the person's personal life). Overtime is often thrown at you last minute, as well as any mandated work days when extra help is needed. 
- Only 30 minutes for lunch. I really feel like the warehouse employees deserve an hour lunch break, especially on busy/overtime workdays. You start to feel like a robot after awhile, so I definitely think a non-mandatory/optional one hour reboot time could help improve work productivity.

Please continue to make your employees happy just as you are and reassure them of their hard work and efforts more often.

Also, my current manager likes to delegate the stuff he should be doing to me despite what policy states, and despite the fact that I don't have a lot of time to do his job in addition to my own.

It is hard to fire bad employees. You have to be written up three times to be fired, so a lot of people are in jobs that require detail orientation and are not detail-oriented. Then the rest of us have to fix their mistakes until they either quit or get written up.

There are frequently unrealistic deadlines and not enough people do to the work. Sometimes managers go against the remote policy and forbid people from working at home, even if we could be more effective working from home.

I would not at all be surprised if this company gets bought out in the next few years.
