","Extremely toxic work culture. Majority of those in management should not be in those positions making strategic decisions for the company. You will only move up if you play politics- skill is essentially meaningless. They do not promote furthering your education. They have gone through considerable layoffs and acquisitions that failed. Most internal operation positions are viewed as replaceable to management and you will be treated as such. The company also works with extremely outdated technology- the customer service department still has to access records through DOS platform. While the life insurance product they offer is top tier in the industry, they also train their career agents that it is the only solution to every client's needs rather than part of the solution. I have seen many shady practices from agents encouraged by massmutual's incentive program. avoid this company at all costs, not worth it.

I have been working at MassMutual full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
MassMutual has a rich history and is in the top 100 for the Fortune 500 list. There is an impressive focus on employee inclusion and many opportunities to participate in many employee groups if desired.
Cons
Slow moving to adjust to marketplace trends and sometimes takes a reactive approach to try to keep up with competitors, which in my opinion at least partially resulted in the sale of the Retirement business.

Clear goals and objectives are not clearly defined or referenced, and by the time workers get back to their day to day life after the quarterly meetings, the objectives stated in the quarterly meetings have already gone in one ear and out the other. 

- I would suggest integrating main goals and objectives into team meetings on a more frequent basis, and request updates from teams as to their status of achieving those objectives.

3. Allow the flexibility of working full time and studying part time
4. Cool benefits - good parental leave policy and even fertility treatment benefit 
5. Social good - you can choose to take a few days off to participate in volunteering or social good activities
","1. seems to have favoritism culture
2. no transparency 
3. no anonymity in feedback - granted that the surveys we filled out were supposed to be ""anonymous"", but the very detailed breakdown of the survey also made it possible for the manager to deduce who wrote what. 
4. hard to give feedback - it's ""encouraged"" to give honest feedback, but it can be met with a lot of pushback. lack of open-mindedness. hard to be truly honest in feedback. 
5. overall value of the company is very vague - ""we protect the ones we love"". sure, how does that translate to the working teams? what are the important values to uphold in daily responsibilities?
Advice to Management
1. Be clear about values you uphold. Make that consistent and cascade that throughout the rest of the company and let those values be the values you look for in the candidates you interview. This way we know that the candidates you eventually hire embody the same values, rather than conforming to any particular hiring manager's personal preferences. 

2. Be transparent with information. 

3. Specific to Data Science Development Program (DSDP) - let the DSDPers be managed directly by their technical leads. The director should be responsible for planning the structure of program and perhaps hiring for this program only, rather than managing the DSDPers as well after they enter the company. It is counter-productive and not useful to have DSDPers navigate the triangular manager-subordinate relationship with both the DSDP director and their direct technical lead. Navigating the triangle can be confusing, tense, and awkward at times. It is much more helpful to have someone who knows the inside out of the technical projects as a direct manager both on paper and in daily work context. Having the DSDPers managed directly by technical lead may also help mitigate some people's perception that DSDPers are just students, rather than budding professional DS.

There is great potential for the company. But please be bold and thoughtful in revamping the structure of management. Be more open in receiving feedback contrary to your own thinking.

","Unethical management; hostile, abusive and inappropriate behavior as the culture has allowed it for far too long. Visually and ideologically you have stepped into the 1950's. Even worse than the usual Old Boys Club behaviors are as follows: 1. The way you are easily discarded (by way of being smeared, then bullied and targeted) once it's ascertained you won't be of any ""use"" to certain higher-ups/VPs. 2. The WOMEN there who support the Old Boys Club (They should hang their heads in shame.). It was scary to have to work among some men who clearly suffer from arrested emotional development. I was starting to feel like I was the subject of a running bet between a group of men. Forget about HR. They will not only support unethical behavior from management, they will help execute it. Scratch the surface and get to the truth: newer employees basically have no rights within the iron gate.

They do celebrate birthdays and have a free lunch once a month which was nice. You can win trips as well as agency trips if you perform well, but I never got there.
","However, on the sales side, you can make money but it helps to be well-connected or very bold and bring up what you do with everyone. A lot of your success also depends on the manager you have; they all have different styles and approaches . Surprisingly, most managers did not do weekly meetings or any scheduled team updates. Be sure to have quite a bit of money saved up as it can be a while before you make enough to live on for many people. They have to recruit heavily because there is a 90% failure rate. 

They also make some very odd decisions too. They have open table space with zero privacy… I mean you literally have a phone on the table with your name above it, no walls and about 2 feet of space. Most reps end up talking in the hallway or conference rooms to get some privacy. The new guy would be well advised to connect with a seasoned guy and do joint work. They also really, really push the best place to work awards and want us to vote. It is voluntary, but there’s a bit of pressure to complete it which I was felt was a little disingenuous.

- Casual dress

- Friendly team
- Opportunity to go to conferences
- Located next to a dog park, and public park
- Helicopter rides between some of the offices
","- Constant verbal lashings from design leadership in the office, at your desk in front of everyone, or during meetings. 
- Poor communication from design leadership. You could ask a simple question like, “Is it X, or is it Y?”, and rather than specifying X or Y, their answer would be, “Yes.” 
- Unclear expectations. Arbitrary deadlines appear out of nowhere in the past.
- Hostile and toxic environment. Leadership reprimands designers for asking simple questions related to projects.
- Dishonest at times. Design leadership frequently will say, “Feel free to reach out if you need anything.” But when do you reach out for help, it gets recorded as an issue, or an excuse to say why this employee is not performing well.
- Unhelpful weekly 1:1’s. Hardly any guidance for setting a clear path to achieve goals for the project. Instead, they use this as an opportunity to release their anger, or criticize your work, regardless if you completed all the tasks they asked you complete. No such thing as constructive criticism. It’s just criticism.
- Poor judgement on how to provide guidance. Rather than seeing each designer with unique set of skills, they imply that they think everyone has the same background, and therefore should behave exactly the same as each other. 
- Antiquated and inaccurate tracking systems. An excel spreadsheet is used to keep track of everyone’s work, and everyone’s time estimates can be completely off. The only thing leadership cares about is that all numbers add up to 20 points per sprint, regardless of what type and size of task you receive. Leadership also becomes irritated if tickets are carried over from a previous sprint. 
- Design leadership considered putting negative reviews on designers who don’t work on enough tickets per sprint, or if a ticket has carried over from a previous sprint - regardless of size or difficulty of ticket. With tickets being dependent on POs writing them, the designer will get reprimanded for something they cannot control. 
- Poor time management. Everyone’s schedule seems to be covered in meetings throughout the day, every day, yet expected to deliver hands-on work with aggressive deadlines. Design leadership berates you for trying to skip 1 standup meeting out of the entire month, for political purposes, despite you bringing up concerns about not having enough heads down time for work, multiple times. There is no such thing as a no-meeting day, as proposed by leadership.
- Micro-managing. They will specifically require designers to include design leadership in every meeting, no matter how small the meeting is.
- Design reviews are 1 hour long, 3 times a week. Feedback is mostly visual design-focused, even if the project is UX. If not visual design, it’s usually criticism about the project itself, not your work. 
- Poor planning. Leadership has asked employees to drop everything and fly to a satellite office at last minute. Since this was so poorly planned, all hotels would be booked out, and you would be forced to fly in/out the same day in order to avoid exorbitant lodging prices. 
- Design leadership has no overall vision, strategy, or ability to inspire the team.
- You are your own Travel Agent, Admin, and HR.
Advice to Management
Get training in all areas related to your role, especially around communications (written and verbal), managing people, managing projects, coaching/mentoring, and how to inspire others.

- Performance reviews are quarterly instead of yearly, and you are evaluated against goals/commitments you set for yourself. Way better experience than once a year high stakes review with a number score.
- Great people, super collaborative environment, everyone is easy to work with, and amazing place to get exposed to and learn a ton of stuff
- Management encourages employees to go to conferences or use tuition reimbursement for personal development.
- 401k match, pension, PTO, free financial planning, decent health/dental/vision
","- Open office seating combined with lack of meeting rooms and call rooms in Boston mean it’s a very noisy and distracting work environment and you can’t personalize your own space or escape to somewhere private to focus. As someone with a major anxiety disorder, this is incredibly triggering and difficult to deal with, and kills my productivity.
- No advancement/career path framework for developers.
- Management is a little hesitant to grant work from home arrangements
- Production on-call 24/7 support once every few months for all developers and delivery leads, can be stressful

Advice to Management
Engaging in deep work requires quiet and long stretches of uninterrupted time. Build some private offices for the people that want them and schedule fewer meetings (or make it so meetings only happen one or two days a week). 

Also, bank holidays are old fashioned. Give us those days as vacation time to use in the way we'd like to use them. In the DSDP, the MassMutual holidays don't always line up with the school holidays, so we end up having a day of class with no work and then a day of work with no class (i.e. we have two holidays that aren't actual holidays).

I have been working at MassMutual full-time for less than a year
Pros
-Casual dress everyday. The motto is ""Dress Appropriately"". This means jeans!
-Flex hours. You come in pretty much when you want to in the morning and leave when you want in the evening as long as you work your 40 hours. Depending on your department, managers are super flexible with your time. I've had the ability to change my schedule for doctor's appointments, family commitments, and various other ""life"" things.
-They encourage remote work! Whenever there is a snow storm or I have something going on at home, I work from home! It's so awesome. Many people have regular work from home days they coordinate with their managers. Some people even do ""condensed"" schedules where they only work 4 days a week.
-They pay almost 100% of costs if you go back to school (grad or undergrad!)
-They have a gym on site with work out classes (yoga/HIT/etc.)
-They have a farmers market and food truck days in the summer
-They have a masseuse that comes in a few times a week that does massages for $1 a minute (15 and 30 min appointments)
-They offer corporate discounts for local ski mountains, events, and more. 
-The cafeteria is awesome. They have a huge selection of delicious food. Much of it is actually healthy also. 
They have dedicated ""meditation rooms"" that I try to go to at least once a week with yoga mats, blue tooth speakers, sound proof walls, etc. 
-They have regular networking events (cocktails and snacks!) for young employees.
-They have insanely good benefits! (My favorite being almost 5 months of maternity leave?!?!) 
-THE PAY REALLY WELL!!!!! And that's what we all really want right?

","Too many associates just biding their time and watching others do the heavy lifting without repercussions. You have very few innovators within the company as new ways of doing things that are against the grain have zero chance of catching on. Management blindly listens to firms like McKinsey and implements programs that don't quite fit the situation or have much of a chance of success. So every two years (for the 25+ years I worked there) there are reorganizations and new directions that stick around for 18 months and then fall by the wayside (and are later recycled under a different name). Case in point - the glut of thousand dollar white boards that were discarded when mmway failed to catch on.

Our CEO, Manny Amezcua, is an incredibly hardworking leader who wakes up with an unknown determination every single day to make this the greatest company in the greater Detroit area. I have never been somewhere where everyone is truly striving to be their best and treat each other, and more important their clients, as family. 

I also find it incredibly unique that we have the backing of such a large corporation with our MassMutual home office in Massachusetts, but get to operate as our own company and firm as MassMutual Great Lakes under the direct stewardship of our CEO. So it's like we're this well-known brand name, but we get to reinvent ourselves to be as daring and different and better, however we choose to see fit.

Our department heads prioritize development, training, the culture, giving back to our community and to Detroit, and our families, and of course our clients, and I myself have just never seen anything like it. It's a special place and a committed one at that. Still growing and learning and changing, but never satisfied with being average or ""good enough"". 

It's not just an ""insurance company"". They are committed to doing things differently and are striving to shake up the industry. #TMD

I worked at MassMutual full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Very few as this is not a company that values its employees.
Cons
This is truly an awful company with horrible management. In all my career have never seen employees treated as poorly as here. The absolute worst behaviors are rewarded. The culture is not of teamwork, collaboration, inclusiveness, and respect. Due to outsourcing and downsizing, everyone is out for themselves. There are major reorgs on average every 6 months. Morale is the worst I've ever seen. Biggest mistake of my career was joining this company. Because of the culture of fear, no one is willing to provide open and honest feedback and all too often people fake or ignore what is plainly obvious because management doesn't want to hear anything except how great things are going. Very hard to move around or advance because they would rather hire outside than promote their own people. Amazing how even simple processes are made overly complicated and designed on purpose as a form of job security.
Advice to Management
This is advice to the board because current management is not going to be able to solve a culture they created. Company needs a new CEO who can change the culture. It won't be easy because the current culture is too engrained. Figure out an operating model and stick with it instead of reorganizing every 6 months. Develop leaders who encourage teamwork and stop rewarding bad behaviors.

Hiring Process is Poor, it took multiple applies just to get an initial interview. Never made it past the first round 5 times in a row only to find out for each one they hired from within. I was highly qualified for each position.
Very judgemental managers, who have a chip on their shoulders. Environment lacks genuine joy. Many people are hired to fill diversity quotas and to obtain annual awards such as the Executive Woman's award, whether those people have the best fit for the position or not. Managers are poor leaders more often than not.

But what baffled me was that how they are wasting money. Since then, all the folks in Boston area are gone. The strategy to begin was the problem but the second and third layers are supposed to pay the price. And the topmost layer is never touched. In the meantime, all the guys who were removed got their packages and most of them got the jobs. The problem is that the guys who replaced them also went through the same cycle. Seriously KPMG and other BS companies should review that behavior. I am not even sure what have they accomplished in the last 5 years.

Listen to your employee's, if someone is reporting bad behavior by management the employee should be moved to a new management team. I had seen forged signatures come across my desk, selling away, and many times sales reps sold outside the actual capabilities of a product. If you can do sales with little conscious or guilt go for it. If integrity matters you may go insane. As with anything t's all what managers you report to. Most managers fear Hue O'Toole , as well as what internally folks referred to as 'friends of Hue'. Be careful around these folks, they can be the key to success or your down fall .

By purchasing companies like Oppenheimer and having strong investments they are set to be one of the top life insurance companies in the world. They offers fantastic products specifically their life and disability products. They are not captive and allow you to sell other companies. Create your own schedule. Offer great training and conferences to succeed. Strong name. Great opportunity to create your own business. They listen to their agents needs and try to solve them.
","All commission can be very stressful. I had to find my own prospects with very little help from my agency. Very little support from my agency, truly running your own business. Charged for rent, printing fees and more. MassMutual's technology has gotten better over the years but still not up to par with other insurance companies. Underwriting is very strict. The hardest part of this industry is finding clients and I wish they focused more on this piece. 

Overall MassMutual is a great company but you have to make sure you are with a good agency that sets you up to succeed. Also that will teach you how to prospect and get leads.

Just to put that into perspective, other similar companies have E&O premium for roughly $100-$150/ YEAR. Mass is $140/MONTH. Take into account you have a 1099 contract and tax time will not be fun. New agents basically have to know people with money to succeed here regardless of what they tell you. Every person I talked to who was successful here had a huge pipeline of people with money to call right out of the gate when they started and they don't even realize that most people don't because they've had money their whole life.

Pros
Those who have an entrepreneurial mindset will do well in this company. Each manager and firm is treated like a business and has the flexibility to act as such.
Cons
The downside of an entrepreneurial culture is that there is not a lot of home office support. They are also a mutual company and whole life products are what you need to sell in order to be successful there. For home office employees, expense allowances for travel are very conservative. If you have to travel, be prepared to pay a lot out of pocket and take the cheapest flights which are not usually the easiest. The benefits consisted of a HDHP so you will pay quite a bit out of pocket for the plan and before they are active.

I have been working at MassMutual full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
This company is trying to become more modern. They have relaxed the dress code, started offering some assistance to mothers and made a small gym at the Phoenix location. They are trying to make the site better for their workers. I do feel that they deliver true to their word about putting the customer first and really trying to provide them the best service possible. Plenty of opportunity for advancement if you put in the hard work and time, career development and involvement options as well.
Cons
You put in a lot of work that feels like it goes unnoticed. There is constant change and conflicting goals between senior leadership. Salary feel well below the average for how well they state the company is doing. Flaws in processes and gaps between the different segments. Clear distinction between the younger workers and the tenured individuals.

Fri Oct 27 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Leadership at the South Florida Office is clueless!,1,"Helping clients obtain financial protection. 

Being backed by a fortune 100 Company. MassMutual is a very large company with a great reputation, track record, and superior dividend history. It's just too bad that the reputation doesn't extend into the local agencies...especially the South Florida Agency.
","Being told how to run your business by someone that just sits in his office all day texting people, all while pretending to think he knows the financial services industry. I had to get out of there, I could only take so much of their ignorance. So many shady dealings and borderline non-compliant choices (like all the cold calling on a scrambled phone to the teacher market in Broward and Miami Dade saying that they service their retirement plans). Don't believe me? Just look up MassMutual South Florida complaints on Google, you'll see the complaints first-hand. They advertise that cold-call job online. 

With all those cards stacked up, I had to leave. It didn't seem worth it to me! 

Best of luck to you if you decide to work there. I send all my friends and family elsewhere.
Advice to Management
I know this may be tough, but try and be ethical for once. I used to hear stories about how that office always did the right thing back in the day....until a new President took over. Maybe stop focusing on money/greed and focus on your clients instead. If you do that then the money will follow from doing the right thing.

Ongoing in-house sales and product training provided, as well as occasional opportunities to obtain CE Credits to maintain licensure. Uncapped earning potential, particularly after you obtain your FINRA securities licenses. Firm will fund State Insurance License exam fees as well as provide study materials.
","Can be a very lonely career choice. While starting your career, be prepared to give 40 - 50% of your commission to a experienced Advisor while you learn the business for the first 3-6 months. MassMutual does not provide any lead lists. You generate all of your own leads, so if you have a weak network, you have a higher likelihood of failure. If you plan to take any FINRA exams, be prepared to come out of pocket for the Series 7/66 or the 6/63 exams (unlike competing firms) and training materials. ""Orphan"" clients are generally not provided to new Advisors. 100% commission after your ""training year."" In-house training is wholly geared towards sales of various Life, Disability, and Annuity Insurance products which is constraining. Investment training is an afterthought and virtually non-existent within the firm although we have the capabilities for brokerage service, individual / group retirement accounts, and managed money ""wrap"" accounts, which I feel is an squandered opportunity. Career-wise, the trajectory is pretty flat compared to other industries.

Some management seem to always choose the same people to work on initiatives and overlook those who work hard day in and day out.

This business structure is not sustainable, you are using 20th century methods to sell products in the 21st century. It would be incredibly easy for your in house research department to take the data of the policies that have been sold over the past 10 years and create a huge list of qualified prospects based on the returns from some pretty basic client analysis. Since the average age of reps is 55 I'd recommend you move away from a 100% commission compensation strategy to offering base with a commission cap on LADL sales while maintaining a minimum requirement of production so people aren't just sleeping on the job after hitting their caps. You need to rethink how to bring young people in here and get them excited and how you are going to compete in the landscape of compressed commissions due to the serious competition of online brokerages.

One time, she even questioned an employees bereavement (out loud) when the employees father died. She has pitted team members against each other, and regularly reveasl employees' personal situations to the team, and laughs about it with her sidekick. Also, if you do not have kids, there is no leniency offered to you. She has an extreme bias when it comes to employees with kids vs employees without. Having to leave early, come in late or take personal days are approved with a smile. If you don't have kids she feels there is no reason for personal days or flexibility with your shift.

I have been working at MassMutual full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Good amount of vacation time, a lot of great people working for them, good maturity benefit with a mother's room available, health insurance is okay but what they have currently is worse than what they used to have.
Cons
The departments often don't work collaboratively and there have been a lot of layoffs with many departments... really lacking in IT and technology!!! Unrealistic goals in that regard, and upgrades have gone disastrous. Performance review program has slightly improved but the sales departments are on a curve so there's almost no point in trying to exceed goals. Some departments are cool with working from home, but it's not a company wide privilege.
Advice to Management
Be honest to your employees (as much as possible), support them because the EEs are the company! If someone leaves, support their evolution and don't keep it a secret where everyone they work with doesn't find out until 2 months later.

","100% commission. ""You're your own boss"". Senior leadership advertises how you make your hours, then complain if you are not ""working on your practice"" 24 hours a day, every day. Since you are ""your own business owner"", MassMutual charges you to work there: office space, office supplies, administrative fees, etc. and they also take out percentages in commission checks. The commission handbook is roughly 400 pages so on your first day, I advice a new agent to memorize all 400 pages to fully understand how much money they will be making when they close a client. Quite the revolving door of fresh talent. Typically 3-6 new agents every 6 months and 1 remaining after 1 year. The revolving door is due to new agent having to create their own book of business. Since the best clients are established professionals, the first logical clients would be family and neighbors. Very difficult conversations to have about life insurance and disability insurance, fresh out of college, with family and neighbors. The next logical clients would be friends, but young people do not want/need life insurance or disability insurance. Tough to have any sort of work-life balance when your income is 100% commission based and new agents are not making any commissions. If a new agent can last more than 2 years, they can start bringing in new talent to their team, that new agent will sign their close family and maybe some friends, and when they leave, the established agent keeps their business. Quite the genius business model.

You can sell MML products from almost anywhere, why settle? If it is the right fit, do yourself a favor and interview with at least 3-4 companies. It's easy, call the office, ask for a manager and ask for an interview. Every manager is driven to fill seats, they will likely interview you. Benefits are good.
","Managers and the agency get a huge override on what they call Tier 1 LADL business in your early years. Outside of that, the overrides are drastically reduced. Following the Met purchase, management in both firms are competing to try to win the right to be the only GA left in Upstate NY. The two GAs in Buffalo hate each other and trash each other to their managers. To ""win"" they have to be profitable and cut costs, which they are doing by firing people with no notice or charging fees to new advisors in excess of $400 per month. You don't have to pay that, find a different company and ask about costs during and if you do not make it. If you fail, and 90% of people do, expect a bill. Want to go somewhere else, maybe keep your clients, expect a battle. MassMutual loves the courtroom.

","little real training, You bring in your friends and family and then ? No Marketing while I was there. Their focus is Mortgage and trade shows. focus on Insurance . very few FT real employees mostly contractor status with really bad benefits. 3000 deduct on health insurance. No book of business, No leads from company, They discourage mass mailings and massive phone calls even when I purchased the names to call due to the do not call laws in NYS. Management is unresponsive and very concerned about inner office critics but when you leave they trash you. Fake sales numbers to motivate the new people. Mass hiring and then mass migration when you can not bring in strangers to sell after they have your friends and family , They made pack the "" forgivable"" draw they paid you for a short time which is not really forgivable if you do not meet all goals , they send your name to collection agency for all money they spent in "" training allowance "" So you have to pay them 6,000 if the position does not work out and most positions will not unless you have friends and family to make those goals so the pressure is on to sell Mass Mutual products required to meet goal. Everyone there is a "" director"" or manager but most are just Reps that did not do well at being a rep so they were given positions of power to keep them around. Retention will be very low . They wanted me to mentor the new people instead of working my own marketing plan and I have 20 years in the business. Do Not work there. and whatever you sign, make sure it's not a "" loan"" agreement , they are sneaky . Gossip is high, Moral is low.
Advice to Management
The principal, David , needs to fire all this fake management people and get qualified people to head all departments and make a real marketing department like your "" benefits statement "" suggests you have already. Massive marketing and phone calls from a phone center and mass mailings and networking is the only way to succeed. I got them to join the chamber of commerce in my last days there , which they should have been involved with actively all along. Stop scamming people with this fake forgivable draw , bait and switch scam , do not let your C,O,O run the show , she is useless and was a secretary a few years ago and now she is running your company ? Really ? Do not hire people until their license is approved by NYS insurance department. Asking reps to write business in their boss's name and rep number is illegal. If you give your managers mortgage leads to distribute and they keep all the leads for themselves , that is morally wrong and highly unprofessional. The sales managers are sales people over seeing new reps. They have no loyalty to the reps at all.. I call it the family and friends program and once you get all their network to buy they are gone. You stole that idea from Metlife and look what happened to them. Going to the Principle of an agency and have to beg for business or for opportunities gives you the power but is very unprofessional that everyone is at your mercy for a paycheck. I had to beg over a two month period to be part of the Mortgage lead program and my emails and voice messages went unanswered for weeks and months at a time as the Principal's secretary was the "" marketing department"" and a busy secretary and in charge of the smooth transition of new reps into the business. She was overwhelmed and unresponsive and took a whole month off due to "" illness"" while most of this work needed to be done. All my emails and complaints and objections to how things were done were shoved back in my face as "" mutiny"" and Treason toward the Company and called "" Snarky"" . so this is apparently a company that can not take any Critic's voice at all. Be quick, do not complain, being in your connections and then you are on your own so be prepared to spend your own money as I did on all marketing and sales efforts as if you were starting your own business out of your home and using a Company name while giving Massmutual half of your commissions and pay for office space and supplies. Worst contract in the history of Financial Services positions out there.

","Severe lack of commitment to client facing and advisor facing technology. The broker dealer is terrible. They have one really good insurance product (whole life). All other products are way too expensive to consider selling to a client. They give too much power to the local general agents and do a terrible job of hiring local general agents. Customer service reps would constantly unknowingly give wrong information about basic procedures and form requirements. WAY to conservative with decisions. Broker dealer would constantly blame FINRA for reasons why certain decisions were made when very few other broker dealers would make the same decision.

Don't treat the broker dealer like it's a necessary evil. Treat the broker dealer like a revenue center and an asset in recruiting reps. Clearly distinguish between company policies and FINRA rules. Don't blame everything on FINRA, it causes the reps to not trust what you tell us.

Poor leadership shown by managers, ""Book appointments and let me know if you want me to go with you"" mentality. Out-dated presentation and approach to gaining clients.
Advice to Management
Invest in your agents, especially those fresh out of school new to this industry. Develop some sort of process for attracting clients other than calling people in their ""warm market"". That literally ruined friendships because I was expected to dial and leave messages until they responded. Get away from the ""sell as many $100 a month whole life policies"" mindset and develop a new training program and presentation that's focused around EDUCATING the client rather than SELLING to them.

Tue May 03 2016, Enterprise Architect,"Springfield, MA",Former Employee ,MassMutual has some growing up to do. The old boys club lives.,6,"As in many companies - the other staff are the best reason to work at MassMutual. There are many individuals who are still interested in doing a good job that helps the customer, internal customer or an external customer.
","Unfortunately the management are purely out for what they get out of any interaction. Whatever is the goal of the day depending on which side of the bed upper management woke up on - is the only goal you should have. And somehow you are supposed to guess what that is. The new lean management system is poorly implemented. Managers have had little to no training in their portion of the system and there is no real support for front line staff determining how to achieve goals, a main point in lean. Metrics are changed too often so managers can use old, current or expected metrics to support any decisions - disregarding contradictory information.
Advice to Management
Hold managers (includes senior VP) to similar standards as your front line staff. If senior staff get to claim victory for their divisions efforts - maybe they should share in the failures too. Or if senior staff is ""winning"" based on bottom line metrics - front line staff should too.

","While I liked that they didn't pressure you to make a sales quota, that allowed people to hang in there a long time with zero production. Other similar companies would cut you loose after 3 months, but MM did not. Might sound good, but they didn't drive you enough. While it's great that they give you a really long opportunity to start producing (100% commission, so you're not earning anything while learning and not producing), I felt a definite lack of drive among the new sales people.

","Compensation below market based median salary even after 9 years employment. MMWay is crushing our spirit. Managers do very little to encourage or guide career development but are more than happy to have you cross-train with other departments so you can take additional responsibility for the same pay and title. Upper management is vastly out of touch with their employees on the floor. Morning huddles and problem solving meetings are often counter-productive and saturated with corporate rhetoric. Skills and accomplishments that go beyond job responsibilities are under-recognized; they'll tell you how much they value what you bring to the table until it's time to review salaries and bonuses; then all you hear is how the budget is tight but here are some suggestions to improve over the next year. Thankful to have a job in general but don't really feel a sense of being valued. Lately I feel like a hollow automaton, pushing work through to please the master that is the corporate giant, each day dying inside all over again...but hey, I'm a single father with a kid and a mortgage so I can't exactly up and leave to frolic about in pursuit of my whims.

If you leave your middle management as liaisons to interaction, by the time you get any feedback it is so scrubbed and polished that by the time it reaches your inbox it is an illusory representation of reality.

They offer a lot of incentives to join and really try and pump you up as far as 'spearheading this new chapter in your life'. But, it's just not there. You get scholarships (which you should definitely have them clarify in the FIRST interview), the training is tedious but good, the environment is awesome.
","You'll sell life insurance to your family.... and if your family doesn't know more people you can sell to, then you cold call. And if cold calling doesn't pan out, you don't make any money. They leave you high and dry when you approach them and tell them you've hit a dead end. 
You have your ""natural market"" and that's it. Oh, and if you're struggling, they tell you to 'team sell'.. which is fine, IF you want to split your commission with that other sales person. So you get the lead, you set the appointment, you drive there to talk to this person and you have to split part of the commission because someone else is there to ""help"" you.
Advice to Management
Get it together with your game plans. I feel like you have too many people trying to recruit, train, etc. and no one to focus on the agents who just started. Also, you should think of a better way to help new agents develop their natural market other than just telling them to go back through it when it wasn't as lucrative as planned. And the whole team selling thing... honestly, it's so dumb. It doesn't make any sense. If you want your new agents to be successful you should let them shadow the successful sales agents. Not have the successful agents ""team sell"" with them and make some extra money for sitting in on a meeting.

Pros
You can get licensed Series 7, 6, and 63 or 65. You can learn the day to day operations of how life insurance works. MassMutual purchased Oppenheimer Funds so getting your stockbrokers license is easier.
Cons
Sales managers now can also sell which is a bad idea because they should be coaching you and not be you competition. They charge you for everything such as faxes, envelopes, copies etc. They nickle and dime you. You may receive a bill instead of a commission check. Commission is kinda low on products anyway.

Wed Oct 14 2015, Financial Services Professional,"Glen Allen, VA",Former Employee ,Financial Services Professional - Extremely Unprofessional,5,"If you're an experienced agent with a book of business then this is a good job for you.
","If you're just starting out from college then it's extremely difficult. If you do decide to take this track, then you should have very rich parents or grandparents willing to let you handle your money. They give you zero leads, shotty one week sales course, and absolutely no capital to start your own business. Also there is a bimonthly charge of $70 for legal counsel insurance. The general agent leads you to believe that this is covered in all of the expenses covered by the agency. Lastly, you are NOT a financial advisor. You are a salesman. Don't let the interviewer lead to believe differently.
Advice to Management
Make an effort to help out your junior agents from the beginning via starting capital or first year of no split commissions. Older, established agents end up taking of people who just start out of the gate. Sales managers need to quit being so pushy on selling products to junior agent's friends and family. I don't see this company being successful with Millennials.

","The local office is so antiquated, there are literally no female agents, only 3 people that weren't white, and they refer to all ""Non-Registered"" staff as ""NRFS"" (nerfs)....this is a reference used for all female employees - who are the people doing a significant amount of the work and the only thing keeping the office together. My last compliance training experience was so dreadful, the video put together from the home office was a total joke, for a company of this size, it was like they hired a 7th grader to make it on their phone. I have been thoroughly unimpressed - they are a dinosaur, so far behind the market trends they aren't even playing the same game.

","Focus on quantity over quality. The corporate culture is sort of cultish at times. Highly skilled people in certain areas would sometimes be stuck in jobs that didn't match their skillset. This caused poor performance on their part when high performance in another area might have happened.
Advice to Management
When employees mention or show strengths, allow them the chance to use them. I was in customer service there. Entry level. I came from an office that was part of a layoff. I was in management there. My skills were in management. I am now a GM at a larger company than MassMutual. If you'd have recognised my strengths, I could have possibly done great things for your company. I saw this happen with many people. People with Law degrees that were stuck in customers service. People with MBAs in the same scenario. They may not be the best customer service reps, but would be great in Legal, Program Management, or Project Management.

This make MassMutual better, and make employees happier.

Fri Aug 28 2015,N/A,"Jacksonville, FL"," in Jacksonville, FL",Financial Services Representative,1,"Company will pay for licensing certification exams which enable a new hire to gain the fundamental knowledge of the industry while also gaining recognition by the state as a certified financial services professional. Without that license from the state, there is no way you can work. Once hired and licensed, monthly client builder workshops are encouraged to attend by your office, whether a satellite or home office, and work in conjunction with other branches your office chooses to associate with. Here you can hear valuable presentations from successful employees and how starting with MML jumpstarted their financial career and led them to greater opportunities as wealth management advisors, financial planners, etc. Also provide a chance to hear feedback on your weekly production numbers compared to others and allows co workers to offer advice on how they overcame challenges you might be facing. It is constructive criticism at its finest (based off personal experience as every firm may differ). Lastly, being employed by a FINRA registered company, one can take SEC required exams such as the series 7 and these are usually partially, if not wholly, paid for by MML. These exams are the foundation for advancing your financial career.
","A self-starter may even be thrown off by the tactics pushed upon new hires. In order to excel to a position that is past the temporary contract agent level requires a lot of networking via cold calling, referrals or door to door contact. With the adequate drive and confidence, it is easily attainable, but delivering the product knowledge to a cold source can become quite challenging without field experience or if one has yet to close their first policy. The first close definitely can boost personal confidence, but the lack of mentorship from management becomes to root of the problem since managers are agents themselves and tend to focus more on personal business than improving the skills of their chosen new hires. There is only so much one can do to better acclimate themselves with an industry without guidance from management. Turnover rates are extremely high because of this. They encourage doing business with friends and family to get the ball rolling, or believe opening a policy on yourself for your first contract will be beneficial towards moving closer to a professional contract, but fail to mention that premiums will eat away at the commission you earned. Seems I forgot to mention, it is 100% commission based. Not good for someone just starting out who needs to have a reliable income.

","It is very political and your peers are not your friends. Corporate restructuring happens often and many employees think of themselves before others. Some people will be willing to throw you under the bus for a gain in their careers, secure their position, or cover up their failing. This happens too often and if you are the type of person that tries to help the company or think long term you will not last long.
