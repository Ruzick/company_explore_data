Fri Jan 29 2021, Product Owner,"Minneapolis, MN",Former Employee ,Good place to work but some issues,0,"U.S. Bank has the highest ethical standards of any American bank, and it stands out for its decency and fairness. I never once felt looked down upon by management, and over my 13.5 years with the company I felt like I myself, my customers, and my co-workers were all treated fairly. There are lots of opportunities for hard workers, and I miss working there. (I was laid off in October 2020.)
","I have only minor complaints from my time working at U.S. Bank.

1. U.S. Bank may be nice, but it's also a ""no frills"" place to work. No fancy holiday parties at this company, and awards to outstanding workers are few and far between. Cost cutting never seems to end, and can be demoralizing.

2. Healthcare coverage with United Healthcare provided by this employer can be a challenge at times. The plans seem appealing at first for their low deductibles and low costs, and the employer sponsored FSA is nice. But if you want to make use of healthcare services you may find yourself fighting with United Healthcare on a regular basis. For example, the bank's mental health plan generously provides $0 co-pay outpatient services once individual deductible is met. But UHC does not code this into their claims processing, and that can mean numerous monthly phone calls you shouldn't have to make.

3. U.S. Bank has in recent years gotten into the bad habit of reorganization through layoffs, and I think they are still learning how to make the process humane. I didn't like that half of my severance payment came with significant strings attached. I especially didn't appreciate the lie told by the bank that laid off employees are favored for job openings. Not only was I turned down for numerous positions for which I was well-qualified, but absolutely no one I know who was laid off was able to successfully get back into the bank. I've only heard of it happening one time. In truth, getting laid off from the bank actually appears to be held against you when applying to get re-hired. The bank's outright lie about opportunities for laid off employees cost me a lot of valuable time.
Advice to Management
U.S. Bank is a great company to work for, and there is a lot to be proud of. I'd like to see laid off employees given better opportunities to apply for job openings. In general, it would be great to see this company try harder to avoid layoffs with better internal restructuring. A company that is always hiring should not be firing so many experienced people without some opportunity for them to first transfer to position openings.

I worked at U.S. Bank full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
I had great people to work with at my branch. I would feel comfortable going back to work for US Bank.
Cons
My immediate manager was very checked out for over a year and did not motivate or inspire us to do better. Most of us just did what was necessary to get by and keep our heads above water. Due to staff cuts, we were too understaffed to make efforts to go above and beyond sales-wise.
Advice to Management
Treat branch employees (including branch management) better so that they will work harder for you. Branch sales slump when no one is cheering on the sales team or tellers. Cutting branch positions and not having plans to replace those people brings down the morale. Remaining team members have to take on additional duties without pay increases and a lot of times have to do those additional duties without support or guidance.

I ended up staying a few more years then planned due to the economy at the time. The benefits were amazing. When I left, I had no clue I had some cash pension account with a decent amount accrued in there. 

I enjoyed my teams and managers and the flexibility was amazing while I got my bachelors and masters. You will learn things you can learn in other jobs like looking at numbers, team leadership, how to be resourceful, the ability to multitask and more! I learned a lot about things due to having amazing managers. My role now is in a different industry and I feel some of the soft skills I learned really helped me.
","It can be difficult to move up.. its a matter of what district you are in.. if its a merit based one you will be good, if it goes more on hierarchy you may be stuck in your role for longer then you would like. It really all depends.. 

You will meet ""lifers"" who are happy at the branch level. They are usually pleasant but a few can be stuck in their ways and not want to adapt to the times. We had a colleague who was a stickler for the rules. A lot of times it impacted her customer service.

I’d be happy to work 80 hours too if the salary was reasonable for it, but for $50k no thanks.

I have been working at U.S. Bank full-time for more than a year
Pros
Employees are treated fairly well from my experience. During COVID I think there was more for employees that could have been done. Some of their decisions also made little to no sense from an employee's perspective, but you have to think like a business to understand their reasoning.
I also learned a lot in the banking industry that would have taken me a lot more work or a higher position to learn at a smaller bank.
Cons
During my interview, manager claimed the company was not sales oriented and they're more so focused on customer service. He wasn't lying about the customer service part, but they're definitely sales oriented too; just as much as their service.

","Terrible incentive plans that consistently changed. Hard working front line employees are not receiving incentives and notoriously under compensated. So either company revenue is going down hill fast or senior management are only looking out for their own pockets. Inadequate Systems that were always down. Company is not structured to keep up w dynamic change, always being reactive vs proactive to change. District managers in Nashville not engaged and have too much responsibility resulting in nothing getting accomplished. Wealth services are great for customers but bankers are not compensated adequately and Advisory services are subpar at best. Business banking are rapidly hiring, but unless your client fits a perfect mold you can’t get deals approved. Managers are overworked, expected to run drawers, produce, refer, manage operations, develop, and everything in between w skeleton crew staffing. Company as a whole is not structured for future success. investment analytics suggest that due to USBs largest revenue share coming from consumer residential loans, and that sector expect to decline, so will company’s revenues. They have to exhaust their only option... cutting expenses like branch closures and valuable talent.

Giving extra jobs and tasks to employees that take initiative is great. Although most of the time this is not rewarded and doing a terrible job is rarely ever reprimanded. Most people look to stay in the middle because what does it matter. It’s hard to become better within a position when this is the environment.

Management is able to save money by not continuing to lease out large office space across the country which was included in the survey.

Advice to Management
Be careful who you hire to lead your sales teams. They can make or break your culture you claim you have. They made a shift from coaching towards best practices to managing strictly by revenue, how much money you can make off each client meeting, and what fee based AUM you can bring in for the bank. The culture has become toxic and completely different than the one exhibited during the recruitment process.

","Back to back calls, I mean non stop can’t even take a drink in between calls. If you put yourself on hold for even a minute the system notifies manager and you get questioned, to use the bathroom or blow your nose.. it was ridiculous. I was burned out within months, actually surprised I stayed as long as I did. Some managers cared and understood were still human but some really acted as though you’re a machine. They give empty promises of being up skilled into a new position but have this metric system that’s just impossible sometimes. I am thankful though for the job as I learned many things that has helped me with a career in the banking world. But the call center some people can handle it some can’t and I was one that was done and will never turn back.
Advice to Management
I would of tried to stay and see where I could’ve gone within the company if there was like a mandatory 2-3 minute between calls. The back to back calls were tedious and mentally exhausting. As soon as one call ended another came in before I could even finish saying bye to the last person. There was just absolutely no time to breathe. And that was the entire 8 hour shift. Could you as a person be ok with that? Be okay with not having 1 minute in between just take get your head together. I know the point is to take care of the customer as quickly as possible, but the workers have to mentally be there as well. Your pay is good but not good enough to cost someone’s mental health. I’ll always appreciate the opportunity I was given but there’s a reason so many people burn out as quickly as they do and that was mine.

Pros
The hours are great. 
Only work a few Saturday’s per year on rotation. 
Laid back atmosphere when paired with a good branch manager. 
The company has shown compassion for its employees during COVID. 
Entry level pay is good.
Cons
You’re a teller. Job description can make it sound like it’s this awesome job, but you’re a teller that’s required to do teller work non-stop. I applied because the job description made it sound like a sales job. It’s not. You’re a teller that requires a whole lot of work 100% of your day. 

Benefits suck. They’re outrageous and cover nothing. Prescriptions are outrageous, deductibles are absurdly high. It costs way too much monthly for a family to afford.
Advice to Management
Be more upfront before hiring people. Make sure you tell them it’s a teller job with a different title. I’m a sales person, not a behind the desk and serve people all day long type of employee.

No delegated assistant managers that are available to help during their shift because they have them on calls too but expect them to have time to help customers and us at the same time which results in delayed help and longer calls. Expected to explain details related to personal or health issues if you need time away or are stughling at work (which legally they cannot require you to release that but they make you justify yourself anyways) ethics line complaints are sent to hr who works on site and managers are notified even though they tell you at the beginning of the call that your information is confidential and will not be shared.

Don’t Take your bad day out on your employees. Always let them feel comfortable asking you for help and don’t make them feel like a burden.

You’re the most conservative bank in the country and have enough budget cuts elsewhere, not to mention senior management does quite well with their million dollar salaries and company stock options, so the least you could do is take care of loyal frontline employees and make sure they have the proper resources necessary to do their job, because they’re the sole reason business stays up and running.

I have been working at U.S. Bank part-time for more than 3 years
Pros
I've been here for 3 years. I've enjoyed working with the customers. Benefits are okay.
Cons
Lots of micro-managing, to the point where it reduced productivity.

U.S. Bank does not seem to care about the mental health of it's ""essential"" employees. Our branch, along with many others, are working with skeleton crews. I moved to part time, 25 hours from 30, in May. My kids where falling behind in school since everything quickly switched to online with COVID. There have been maybe 2 weeks that I've worked at close to 25 hours since then. Due to staffing, it is normally between 29 - 31 hours per week. I've brought these issues up with both my manager and district manager. My stress levels are at an all time high and not being able to have a flexible schedule where I can help my children does not help. If things don't get better soon, I will be in a position where I have a choose between work and my kids.
Advice to Management
Care about ALL of your employees. Stop brushing things off and listen. If multiple people in a branch are having issues, take a look at the branch. Something is wrong.

I worked at U.S. Bank full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
I was able to get into the banking industry without prior industry experience. This opportunity created great relationships with coworkers and customers alike. I gained a massive amount of knowledge within banking and the financial industry as a whole, some from the company learning center, even more from long-term employees. U.S. Bank's good employees are what makes this place great.
Cons
It's a massive company! Retail banking technology can have its issues, but they do their best to continue updating. Communication between departments can be time consuming and sometimes inefficient. The worst part is the turnover rate within retail banking - since the Banker positions are more of a stepping stone, they seem to be too slow to promote to the next level, therefore talent goes elsewhere or to a different department sometimes causing branches to be short-staffed. For example I went through 4 Branch Managers over 3 years.
Advice to Management
My advice to management is to improve communication with your employees and SHOW that you're making an effort with actions after the conversations. Do a better job with performance reviews to create goals and a path to the next promotion AND DELIVER the promotion after those goals are hit.

I have been working at U.S. Bank full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Pay is good, a lot of great and intelligent people, products are great for customers and definitely outshine a lot of others in the industry. Great networking and team culture. You definitely get to know others in and out of your district. Communication from the top to the bottom is highly focused on ensuring we all get the correct message and communications, even from the CEO.
Cons
Employee value and development started decreasing. Management titles were taken away from employees, even ones that held them for years. Renamed management roles to ""consultants"" lowering the value in their title to their clients and the way they feel in development and look on a resume. Pay scales were changed and incentive pay was eliminated for most branch employees. Very strict and scared when it comes to HR issues that its almost impossible to avoid working with a bad apple because they are too scared to discipline or terminate people that don't produce/take their job seriously or cause issues in the office.
Advice to Management
Focus on your employees that want more. Take the time to discuss their futures with them and just simply be there to help get them there. Stop letting things slide. This is finance and our clients can't afford to have people handle their finances that dont take their job seriously.

Thu Feb 06 2020, Social Media Specialist,"Minneapolis, MN",Former Employee ,Room for improvement.,1,"- Good benefits (PTO, sick time, etc.)
- Loved my extended co-workers.
- Flexible work location culture.

I appreciated the updates made to company policy to include more sick time and to also allow sick time to be rolled over. You have the ability to purchase additional vacation days. Vacation days are use it or lose it, so plan accordingly.

The team I worked on has employees located throughout the states (in other offices and also 100% remote) and is very telecommunication focused. Presence in the office was rarely a necessity. Even when the entire team was in the office, they met via virtual meetings and not in-person unless it was for a special training.

The team had an 'always a student' culture. I was empowered to take continuing education courses as well as begin my Master's degree with assistance from the education reimbursement program. I also had the privilege of attending multiple conference (local and out of state) which I will always be thankful for.
","- Poor management checks and balances.
- Low pay increases. 
- Low focus on camaraderie.

My largest grievance with U.S. Bank was that I rarely felt appreciated and think there's a large opportunity for improvement through employee recognition. My communication and recognition styles, while asked for and communicated often, were disregarded leading me to feel a low sense of morale and essentially no camaraderie with my immediate team members. 

When accepting this position, I was an internal hire transitioning from another team. It gave me a leg up in getting hired but was a hindrance when making a case for an increase in compensation. I was told there was a cap on what my pay increase could be, a policy which I heard was either overturned or never existed shortly after accepting this role. It was very he said, she said so I'm not confident in any of that information. Regardless, during my time in this role, I provided research on compensation for similar positions in our geographical area, completed continuing education courses and became a niche subject matter expert and instead of being rewarded and empowered through this proactive growth, my position was ultimately eliminated and I was laid off from the company.

- Improve accessibility to senior leaders to improve opportunities for advancement. 
- Formalize merit/pay increase requests and make them available year-round vs. one time per year.
- Continue your culture of continuous growth through training and education for employees.

","Where to begin? Corporate restructuring called for eliminating the incentive package for bankers - not managers. In between the Monday when it was announced and the Wednesday mandatory cheerleading meeting I touched $3.2M of influence and was given a .21 an hour raise to compensate for the incentive being withdrawn. I guess they thought bankers couldn't do the math? A couple months later all banker positions were eliminated with encouragement to apply along with everyone else living in the area scrambling for a lower paying position. There is a lot of hoopla about the ""someday down the road"" that truly is a dead end. Management puts so many unrealistic obstacles in place and then if you do by some miracle meet or exceed them, you are told it is not your time yet. Bla bla bla. The branch itself was seriously outdated with plumbing problems in the restroom regularly, heating/cooling was a guessing game, the furniture was cheap and beat up, and the flooring, fixtures, woodwork, paint etc was all pathetic. Cheap! This for one of the most profitable branches in the region and sometimes in the nation. Big question? Where did all the revenue go? You guessed it -- upstairs to the important people in management and the beloved share holders - who btw have no idea, none whatsoever, what it actually takes to generate the revenue they enjoy by cultivating real live relationships with customers who trust your judgement. I'm pretty sure they haven't worked with the public because they are so insulated from reality and believe a dumb script written by a recent college grad right out of the frat house will be just the magic to do the trick. Speaking of tricks, if you want to have statistics, matrix and goals run at you in so many directions you won't be able to decipher where to start - this is a job for you!!!! I have a sense they create confusion so you really can't figure out the shell game being played. Then don't forget the ""power days"" when it is mandatory to stop all the work you have in progress until you sign customers up for the mobile app - all the while getting hundreds of emails crowding your inbox from those in the region boasting ""Just got my app"" - peer group pressure at its worst. Then waste an hour finding the one email you NEEDED to close a loan. Yup - given a choice between getting a mobile app or a $500K mortgage refinance I will take my dose of shame as a loser and close the real deal - sort of how grown ups do things. FYI when a customer came in to lock their interest rate on a HELOC (a three keystroke process) I would very often turn the deal into a refinance, wrapping the mortgage from another financial institution into it. Even so loans were a nightmare to get through because underwriting is a bunch of idiots in remote locations (picture kitchen table with their slippers and pajama's on?) who can't figure out a P&L or SFP for anyone who isn't a straight W2 wage earner. You know, the folks spending the real $$ with skyrocket high FICO scores and strong equity positions. Ya those guys who after 10 days would be turned down for a simple 15K boat loan because the dealer didn't describe the onboard motor completely. How embarrassing when the same customer then shows you the US Bank website advertises it can be closed in one day if done online instead of with a banker and also reminds you they could have put it on a credit card with 0% financing for 20 months. But hey, I could get them a mobile app with a very low transaction limit which defeated the whole purpose since they rarely do anything for under $100. Technology? What another nightmare. On a bad day, the whole system would go down for hours so you couldn't use your computer. On a good day, you'd only have to spend an hour or so on hold with support, take your chances on if you got someone who could actually help. Total time sync. But the real problem is, you won't get paid nearly enough to even live in the same area where your COI is. Don't forget to pick up your dry-cleaning on the way home so you look like a banker when you come back into work tomorrow. No one should have to wear a suit who makes under 35K a year. For this I went to college!

","Despite many coworkers constantly setting higher bars of excellence, many newcomers were attracted by the high base pay and benefits but did not wish to commit to the job as a whole. This was apparent by their lack of caring, either for the company or the customers. When working in a customer service position, it is paramount that you advocate for the customers, while also balancing the business' needs. Several people would show up ""just for the paycheck"", and they rarely lasted, but it was discouraging to work alongside those with no passion for their work.

-Lay offs are common and they say they will freeze internal positions to help find another position. There is no internal help to secure another position.
-Management does yearly evaluations to gage where you want to go within the company but has no intention on helping a person to get there.
- They claim there is a open door policy, but there is retaliation.
- They move people to new groups and don't compensate accordingly. People will do the same job but get paid $10+/hr less than another.

","Company is going through a lot of changes recently and a lot of people have been left without jobs. My current job role went from being great ... to very competitive in terms of having everyone fight for customers in order to meet your monthly sales goal. The company is very sales goals oriented and it can very exhausting. As of now, there used to be one person who every opportunity went to and that was great because it was great commission for that person but now with all the company changes, all those opportunities that went to that one person is now divided to every employee in that branch because we all have the same “job title”. This wouldn’t be a problem if we all didn’t still have to meet the same goal that “one person” had to meet. But the company has failed to give employees details on the changes and what to expect. Some people were just told a month before that their jobs will no longer exist. Some were demoted but most were promoted to a job that basically requieres you to SELL and if you don’t, then bye bye. I love this company but with all these changes.... not so much. Also, branches are sooooo short staffed that all you get are complaints from very rude customers because certain branches have closed near them and now have to go to a farther one. I’m sorry but this is putting A LOT of pressure on branch employees, not to mention the sometimes mandatory Overtime because of short staffing.

","Changes are being implemented accross the retail side with no foresight for the consquences. There is already inadequate staffing at most locations to keep up with customer traffic, and by years end, many of the expereinced employees in full time positions will be shown the door as well. Training is severly lacking, contributing to high turnover, a long learning curve and low engagement. Little help or direction is given from upper management leaving many branch managers constantly scrambling to manage the chaos.
Advice to Management
Ethics are all but absent under current leadership. Long time customers and valuable employees are being alienated and voting with their feet. Cutting some your best employees may help the balance sheet in the short term but is going to hurt it down the road. This is not the atmosphere Richard Davis worked so hard to create.

Like i said it was laid back so casual clothing was warn. And when i worked weekends alot of ppl took it a step further and you could where your sweatpants and hoodie. i loved it. i had a close amazing relationship with my manager. she might have even cared a little too much. you wont find that through the whole company i know i got lucky with her. We had monthly employee bonding where we ate had potlucls and played games. You get yearly bonuses and raises. I know even on my worst year with some issues i still recieved a 25 cent raise. i had a great schedule working 4 days a week and 3 days off. you get to sit all day but that works against you as well as ive developed back problems and they dont provide massages or stuff like some places might. i heard they used to. The best thing about the job besides the pay is benefits. best insurance ive ever had. took a bit out my paycheck but pretty much worth it. The highlight was that they provide 35,000$ towards infertility treatments which i needed and you dont find that anywhere!

","Long hours- many 10+ hour days with no lunch and no bathroom breaks.

Advice to Management
Hire more people instead of laying off those with experience- all the missed lunches and bathroom breaks we have to beg for and often forgo should ensure that you will be hit with an inevitable class action lawsuit. .

","After Richard Davis left, the company culture changed and became less people oriented. Senior leadership always defaults their policies to 'manager discretion'. As a manager for many years there, I saw some horrible and extremely unethical actions taken by managers. Human Resources will always back up the managers. For example: If a manager does not like a certain employee, that employee better watch their back because they will be 'black balled' in the organization. I have unfortunately watched peer managers get away with this behavior. I have seen managers sit around in conference rooms attempting to ascertain which employee said what comment on the annual all employee surveys. I have seen promotions due to favoritism. I know calling the ethic hotline is NOT anonymous. I have heard with my own ears how the details are provided verbatim to HR and the manager of the employee. I will not go on any further, just beware that this is a corporation that likes to put out the 'perception' of being ethical and is really just hiding the ugly behind closed doors and poor management.

Advice to Management
This is advice is for upper-level management: Pay attention when extremely bright and credentialed employees start to flee in droves due to ONE common factor - the SAME tyrannical and power-drunk manager with zero emotional IQ. She is clearly threatened by anyone perceived to be smart or capable. It seems to be luck of the draw - if you happen to get a great manager, people tend to stay forever, if you happened to get *this woman* as your manager, you will likely quit fairly quickly, or end up on anti-depressants.

","Technology is outdated, system is down every 2 weeks for an hour or more. Manager set unrealistic goals when there is no body coming into the branch. Managers can come late or whatever time they want to but employees are scold at if they are late by 15 minutes. Sick time leave is highly discouraged. Short staff, managers are unknowledgeable. Bankers have to figure out there own issues by calling retail support 10 times a day. Bankers are half tellers and half banker but mostly get to handle problems left and right for managers with low pay.

Treat employees better, be more fair, update the systems.

","I was hired as peak time teller and quickly promoted to Banker 1. I felt good in the beginning (first 3 months) But hitting goals were tough, and I wasn’t hitting my monthly goals which led to my termination. However I was doing better than I had in the beginning. Which made me question why they let me go even though I hadn’t hit my goal, but came so close! I had only been with the company 9 months. I was literally thrown in to the position with not much help other than “any questions?” Or just here and there help. I just wasn’t getting good vibes the last month or so. I really was looking forward to a career with this company too.
