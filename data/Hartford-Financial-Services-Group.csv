Thu Jan 14 2021, Bodily Injury Claims Adjuster,"San Antonio, TX",Former Employee ,I would have loved to retire with this company but...,1,"The pay is higher than the standard, remote work after a lot of bargaining or based on how much your team leader tolerates you.
","I loved my job role, my career path, my teammates mentoring others and what the company stood for until I found out I was not hirable for anyone other job role than the one I was currently in. It really makes someone reconsider all of the sacrifices you make as employee, mentally and physically, just so that a share holder can buy fuel for his private jet while front line workers walk bureaucratic tight ropes just to make ends meet. You are constantly trying to balance adjusting a claim and making sure to meet all of your metrics. Your team leader literally has a grade-book that they complete every week, which if you like elementary school can be a good thing otherwise you will also have to get used to your smiley/sad faces to measure your progress. Even your days are monitored by how happy, sad, or indifferent you are and it is all tracked so they can later use it against you. Everything is numbers oriented and lean processing except when they want you to finish your workload yet not make it obvious that you are working through lunch, after hours and on the weekend because they do not want to pay you for your time. Get used to defending customer service surveys and filling out internal surveys without being able to provide your real opinions (I witnessed people being written up for giving their actual opinions, lol). Lastly, prepare yourself for the worst part which is actually using your benefits. I haven’t heard many success stories for people using FMLA/STD/LTD and usually people don’t come back or are let go when they do. I can say in my experience I lost my car and home due to a clerical error made by one of their benefit advisors which left me without pay for over six weeks. The response I got was, “It’s ok, someone will just GIVE you a car”. Things got really interesting for me having to walk to all of my doctors appointments and procedures with a broken foot. It’s been almost two years and I’m still waiting on that manager’s promise but I guess I shouldn’t hold my breathe.

Wed Dec 16 2020,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Your happiness depends on a few factors: department, manager, site",1,"Excellent PTO, great 401(k) matching, great work life balance (in my department, not in all of them!) Free money to help pay off student loans. The company is at least making efforts in the area of Diversity and Inclusion, where many insurance companies have apparently given up (talking to you, AIG). HR is less than perfect in many areas, but has been excellent with me in handling FMLA, bereavement, and a complaint about racism. (But note: complaints of racism appear to be common in some other departments, such as IT.) Remote work options. Company is taking COVID seriously and is not like a lot of other companies that are asking people to risk their lives by going back to the office too soon.

For years, I loved the company and the benefits and wanted to stay, but hated my actual job. A while back took a lateral shift and am now incredibly happy in a new position.
","There is huge variability at The Hartford. In some departments, there may be employees who have been there 35 years. In other departments, like Personal Lines Sales, while there are some long term employees, you will likely start with a training class of 20 and 18 months later there are one or two of you left remaining. One thing to notice in looking at the reviews is that many of the 5 star reviews seem to be left by people higher up on the food chain - many of the 1 star reviews are left by people working the front lines. The unhappiest departments seem to be Sales (especially Personal Lines Sales, but also Business to some extent), Claims, and IT. In some departments, you WILL be chained to your phone and you WILL be a slave to metrics. In some departments, you'll be working a 40-41 hour week and taking time off is easy; in others you may be working 60 hours a week and falling behind. Talk to actual current employees before you start to know what you are getting into!

Some of the benefits are excellent, but pay is generally on the low side for most jobs. However, it's important to consider total compensation. I don't want to work at a company that pays me an $10,000 a year more than Hartford but then wants me to work an extra 20 hours a week more than I work here.

The unhappiest locations seem to be the main office in CT and the PA offices, while the TX office seems to have the most complaints about managers and favoritism. While not perfect, some other locations like AZ seem to have fewer complaints, which may be a function of local leadership.

Some departments have very little opportunity for career growth, which remains a pain point. People resent the fact that in many cases the company will go outside to bring in people for more senior positions, rather than hiring from within. Most of the time, you have to be diligent about trying to achieve career growth here - there are not automatic pathways you can follow. You really have to look for a mentor, apply for internships, etc. Some of the perceived lack of opportunity is real; some is based on unrealistic expectations.

I would not take a front line manager position with the company for any amount of money. All stress, no authority. You can't even pick your own team members! You can have a great team, everyone is happy, then upper management does a shake up and takes away 2 of your rock stars and replaces them with Bitter Betties. There went your team metrics and your team morale!

Management training has been spotty in the past. I've had multiple managers from the wonderful to the terrible. Hartford is generally not good at recognizing when they have a bad manager - as long as the manager is meeting their metrics, they can pretty much suck in every other way and nothing will be done. However, it looks like the company is working on making some progress in that direction.

IT and the internal software systems are consistent pain points. The IT department is so dysfunctional that good people don't stay; some of the software systems are literally from the 1980s. Progress is being made in this area but it is at a glacial pace. If you're coming from a company with top of the line current software and a great IT department, prepare for disappointment.

All in all, I would say - don't automatically believe the 5 star ""everything is wonderful"" reviews, or the 1 star ""murdered my sister, burned my ranch, shot my dog, and stole my Bible"" reviews. I hope and plan to retire with the company, but it's not for everyone. Check out reviews specifically for 1) your department 2) your job and 3) your location. 

Namaste.

Sun Oct 11 2020, Short Term Disability Claims Analyst,"Minneapolis, MN",Former Employee ,Fast Paced,2,"As a short term disability analyst, you spend your day answering the phone (being given information or asked by claimants about the status of their claim, a constant source of interruption of your workflow), reviewing claims (policy booklets, medical records, medical documents), and answering emails (essentially the same as phone calls, although you get emails from internals with requests from the employers we serve). 

Your main metric for advancement is your costumer service metric. At the end of the day, customers want their money quickly, and your remaining metrics are mainly about speed, with quality being lowest priority (although this is implied, nobody ever explicitly states this). I had the second highest customer service score for 2 years and the fastest processing time in terms of tasks, email response, and voicemail responses. I received a 5 dollar increase in one year for this performance, but it was a tight labor market (2018 - 2019). 

Claims handlers for short term and long term disability are expected to work 10 to 12 hour days (and this is before being in management). If you want overtime and extra money, it can be an intellectually stimulating job and the day goes by quickly. But if you want to work at 40 hours and have work life balance and low physical/mental/emotional stress you are unlikely to find those, or at least all of those things, in that role at that company. My experience networking internally was that many other areas of the business are not like this culturally. 

I was given a volume of work much higher than my peers. Most people have a caseload of 250 -300 depending on their experience and ability and how the work load fluctuates for the department as a whole. My caseload prior to being fired was 415. As the volume of work gets that high, you are in a position where it is not possible to maintain every aspect of your role at a level that makes you available to customers and meets all your core metrics. I was often criticized for how available I was by phone, how long it took me to respond to emails or voicemails. I had done a lot of tricks with excel and one note to meet the demands of the job and I was very organized. Members of management repeatedly expressed astonishment at how much work I got done while having exceptionally high core metrics. 

At the volume of work I had, getting the work done at the speed they wanted often meant leaving certain voicemails or emails not responded to. I was often approving things without actually reviewing them. And when I expressed to management that I was doing these things and that my case load was too high and that I couldn’t process this volume of work, the conversations often went nowhere, or I would get work lowered for awhile and then it would surge back up again, or in a couple cases it felt like they didn’t want to hear it. Its unclear whether the corners I was cutting where ok, or only ok with certain managers looking the other way.

You are either stressed because you are less productive, always behind, and always being pushed by management to work long hours, or you are stressed because you are productive so you are given extra work. At one point I had a high case load and was still asked to help out people who were behind on their work. I couldn’t help others, have a high case load, and be as available by phone as they would have liked. Also, I would say to that it always felt like the email response criticism was really internals angry that I was not responding to/prioritizing their emails (a true accusation, but it was a biproduct of my work load). I didn’t swear or write anything in email correspondence that was egregiously rude or unprofessional. 

Management is often indirect and a bit emotionally manipulative when having conversations about the work load, which is a turn off. I did 6 interviews, and if you flexibly define training, I didn't get out of training for 3ish months. It was not until month 3 or 4 that the expectation that one would work 50 - 55 hours a week was discussed. 

I was ultimately fired for emails being unprofessional and the low number of calls I answered. If they have an employee who can do that work more quickly and effectively than I was, I deserved to be fired and they should keep those employees. But based on my experience, I doubt there are other employees who were as productive as me (and I would have been just like everyone else if I didn’t know or figure out a few tricks with excel and one note to make me faster at the job). There was no performance management, and the firing occurred during 2020 covid in the cotext of a massive layoff they were doing in my subdivision of the business so the reasons could have been a pretext. 

I liked the people I work with, and I liked many aspects of the company culture, and while the job was not a long term fit, I learned a lot and did enjoy parts of it. Until they decide to hire enough employees and give employees a lower work load, I think they are going to continue to see high turnover or have employees who were burned out as I was.
","Claims handlers for short term and long term disability are expected to work 10 to 12 hour days (and this is before being in management). If you want overtime and extra money, it can be an intellectually stimulating job. But if you want to work at 40 hours you will either be miserable, or in most cases wont be able to. If you find a way to increase your productivity, you will be assigned more work, which means you wont get work life balance by being more productive and the increased volume makes it harder to hit your metrics. You will keep working long hours, and you are held to speed expectations regarding your email response, phone availability, and task completion that do not factor your work volume. Management is often indirect and a bit emotionally manipulative when having

They don't reprimand micro-aggressions, they have an outdated and performative Diversity & Inclusion strategy. They promote Diversity & Inclusion as their greatest asset, but if you work there long enough you will understand that it lacks true substance. If you don't need a promotion for the next 5 years and are okay with seeing your non people of color colleagues get promoted before you, the company is phenomenal to work for. If you are still growing in your career, need coaching or are a woman of color, work somewhere else.

Reprimand micro-aggressions. There are so many toxic personalities that harass women of color through daily micro-aggressions and there is nothing being done about it throughout the company. Check your numbers, check how many Women of Color left your company this year. Among all the people that left your company, I'm willing to bet that women of color were among the highest group. It's because of the cons list above. You do not provide a safe and supportive environment for women of color. You do not provide equal opportunities for women of color. Promote Black, Indigenous and other women of color. Coach & mentor women of color. Stop only promoting and growing non people of color.

It's because of the cons list above. You do not provide a safe and supportive environment for women of color. You do not provide equal opportunities for women of color. Promote Black, Indigenous and other women of color. Coach & mentor women of color. Stop only promoting and growing non people of color.

Mon Oct 05 2020, Sales Representative,"Penn, PA",Former Employee ,Nothing but a number,1,"- Able to work from home 
- Generous PTO
- Employees were good quality people
","- Micromanagement (you are literally glued to your desk for hours on end taking back to back calls and I can’t even step away and use the bathroom without someone demanding to know where I am, even if it’s only been 2 minutes)
- High expectation of sales quotas the majority of quote prices are $1,000’s+ what people pay yet they expect you to sell a minimum of 57 policies a month. I would track my calls every day and some days I only had 4 calls to work with and would sell 2-3 of those calls. What more could I do? 
- Being fired in the middle of a pandemic due to not meeting sales goals is a low blow. Most people calling in were needing to save money just like everyone else due to not working or just trying to lower their costs. But Hartford gives such crazy premiums or declines everything under the sun it makes it hard to sell. But losing my job in the middle of this is just crazy to me I dedicated 7 years of my life to this company and they just let me go as just a number.
- Sales metrics they literally have 10 metrics you need to meet and follow that just revolve around what your selling and how much. Just too much to keep track each day. You go in do the best you can with what calls you have to work with and go home. I have no control over what calls I get, the premiums or people’s choices. But yet Hartford stresses to focus on things within your control but in reality majority of the job is not in my control.
Advice to Management
Advice? Have some humanity firing people over metrics during a global pandemic is so low and so thoughtless. I’m glad to know upper management can sleep well at night knowing they have a pay check coming in and food is on their table when I can’t say the same. Everything else I stated is bad on their ends along with playing favoritism and black mailing you in order for them to get what they want but to do this in a pandemic is just beyond ruthless.

Advice to Management
oh, i don't know, maybe:
1. Don't actually tell people to work 60 hrs/week to get the job done. 
2. When an employee brings you solid evidence of an unfair annual review, at least look at the evidence. The employee showed you 4 peer reviews that were mostly positive, but supervisor selectively chose only the 'development opportunities' (and none of the positive feedback) to put on the review. For the team, that was demoralizing. Not even HR cared.
3. Change the 'you are as good as your last project' kind of culture. 
4. Allow time for your employees to train. Not the one hour a week you put on people's calendar that no one really has time to do! I mean, really invest in your people.
5. Give your employees the resources they need. Understand that a data scientist is not a DBA. If your clusters go down 4 times a day and all work is lost, is your issue to solve (for 3 years!).
6. High senior management turnover (about a year or two) makes for a very unstable culture. 
7. 'Shipping beats perfect' to management means 'deploy product fast, even if not perfect'. To employee 'get it done fast, but if things go wrong, it's your fault!' 
8. To move up, you need to move around, which usually means another company.

Tue Apr 21 2020, Senior Applications Developer,"Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,One month in.... Great experience so far,2,"My first day at The Hartford, was the first day the physical office was shut down due to COVID.

(For a short time) Only the new employees were there, to obtain the ID badge, laptop, and to talk with either their manager or HR about new employee essentials (how to sign up for health insurance, how to contact the 24/7 help desk, etc). All of us then left, to work remotely.

Because many of the software teams are dispersed around the US and also other countries, this company was already set up for remote work when the pandemic hit -- unlike many other companies.

They assign each new technical hire a mentor, and I currently have two. Both mentors have been very helpful in getting me up to speed, and I am learning more each day. My manager also checks in with me during ou 1 x 1 meetings.

Everyone I have talked to, has been very down to earth, easy to talk to, and technically proficient.
","The only con that affects all of us on a daily basis is -- there are many meetings -- due to these massive systems being interconnected. Along with a much slower pace, as far as learning is concerned. However this is understandable, as the company has been around since the early 1800's.

Thu Jan 30 2020, Multiple Roles,,Former Employee ,The Buck Cares About the Buck,6,"If you've never been in insurance or need an entry level job to get some experience then it can be worthwhile, but once I had some experience or a license I'd start to look elsewhere. They pay for your licensing and give you time to complete your CE for renewal and keep track and pay for it as long as it's needed for your job. Also you can meet some great co-workers and that can make the day worthwhile talking to them through the day for help or just to help the day go by.
","The company tries to pass itself off as some highly ethical or employee focused company when that is the farthest thing from the truth. They do everything they can to make themselves look on the outside as the best insurance company out there, once you work there and see whats going on inside you see what is really going on and the truth behind the company. All they care about is what awards they can get to make themselves look good and up the stock price. That is there main concern the stock of the company. The leadership is completely out of touch with employees. Most have phone jobs talking directly to customers, and the phone jobs are hostile. Customers yell, cuss, and go crazy all the time and most of the time have no idea what their talking about. Most also take between 20 to 50 calls per day, they do so much work and the pay is so low for what you do. You have a set schedule every day, when you are on the phone, when you take breaks, lunch, etc. When you go to the restroom unscheduled you'll be scolded for not being on the phone. It's also really hard to shadow or learn other roles since your time is planned out and it's difficult to get off the phone so most don't get development opportunities. Turnover in the phone jobs is horrific, and means you'll have back to back calls with no breathing room most of the time. Exempt jobs are suppose to be 40 hours a week but if there backlogged or behind they try and make you work more than 40 hours, and with being exempt there is no OT or extra pay. Most employees can't find growth with the company, out of a class of 15 before 2 years in the company over half had left the company. They will go outside the company for better roles like supervisors, managers, etc. so they don't have to train an internal employee who hasn't been in that type of role before instead of hiring from within and giving an employee a career path. Unless your picked up as a mentee or have a friend in a certain position your passed over for positions and most won't have a career here. It's more like do they know you and are you apart of their click. I was told I wouldn't get an underwriting job I applied for by the trainer since I didn't have any name recognition. I overheard another manager say we'll I guess we have to hire her since she's applied 3 times now. They also will get rid of departments and ship them overseas or just find way's to get rid of employees so they can have a reduction in staff but not have to announce it to the public to not hurt the stock price with an announcement of lay-offs. Also HR is not your friend here. On there website they have the HR rules, and then they have a bunch of rules they cite but will not show you or disclose. I argued with them about a PTO request and they cited a rule not on the site and I didn't know about it til it came up. Also they say after 1 year in your role you can apply to other positions. After 1 year I applied and the director took away my app saying I couldn't apply til 1 year after my training ended. Again, not on the site specifying that and other roles say 1 year from your start date, but another department making their own rules. Speaking of training it is a joke and known as a joke to everyone, for a company so old and in insurance for so long how they don't have good training materials or structure is incredible.

","Where do I begin? I've worked at major carriers and have boatload experience, and I have never experienced the amount of micromanagement and hostility as I did at this place. Training was good, but once you are working on a team beware. Some of the managers were ok, but if you are unlucky to get one, he/she will make your life miserable. Lying, manipulation of work product, and the expectation of unreasonable work hours are the norm here. I have never been treated as poorly as I was at this company, and it seems that many really just come there for the training and are out within 2 to 3 years. The only way you can get ahead is if you are single and have no kids and are willing to put in a ton of overtime for free. I lost respect for senior management when they refused to address issues with a problem manager. Overall this company was a huge disappointment. There are better places to work who offer more competitive pay. This company does not value work/life balance or their employees well being and the overall company culture is depressing. If they could put an ankle monitor on their employees to manage them in the office they would.

","Lower & mid-level management is comprised of dangerously ignorant lackeys who treat their little piece of the big Hartford pie as their personal fiefdoms. Woefully ignorant of industry, governmental and statutory practices, regulations and laws, they make up their own rules based upon nothing but the need to appear smarter than their employees. Unfortunately, in my experience, they are not. Best Practices are a joke that, according to mid-management, can be changed to favor individually cherished employees at any given time. There are not actually any firm rules - and this company is a whistle-blowers dream.
I have a disability which went undiagnosed for several years. When I was finally diagnosed and treatment was prescribed, I was very proud of the fact that the most obvious symptoms of my disability were brought under control. I actually had an Employee Relations rep refer to my much-improved symptoms on THREE occasions as ""excuses for your bad behaviors"". 
I have personally been slandered, libeled and generally lied to and about by a manager with deep insecurities and what I suspect tobbe a vicious and malignant personality disorder. I have gone to our Compliance when this manager has placed our customers' funds at risk - with absolute proof of her negligence and purposeful violations of practices meant to keep our investors' funds secure. Nothing is EVER done.
The less knowledgeable/competent employees are actually rewarded for their incompetence, and given the most in-depth and important tasks on which to work - tasks at which they must invariably fail. However, managers here are most supportive of the lesser talented employees because their ineptitude makes the managers appear talented by comparison. The Hartford is a study in the Peter Principle at work.
Perhaps you are aware that The Hartford has been named ""One of the Most Ethical Companies"" by The Ethisphere Institute for the 11th year in a row. Ethisphere is a for-profit company that sends out a survey to companies that request it. The COMPANIES fill out their answers, they are named as ""Most Ethical"" and pay a $10,000 fee to use Ethisphere's logo and tag line.
Do ethical companies actually have to PAY to be named ""ethical""?

Sun Jul 21 2019, Insurance Sales Agent,,Current Employee ,"Great company culture, rocky sales organization",8,"1. The Culture. The people are great. The company spends a lot of time, energy and resources cultivating an inclusive and fun environment. They do this through ERGs, volunteer opportunities, company outings and department contests.
2. The Training, both new hire and ongoing. Again, The Hartford puts a lot of effort into making sure their employees are informed about changes in company policy, underwriting guidelines, process headlines, and organizational changes. 
3. Work/Life balance. Your work stays at work, OT is optional, attendance policies are generous, and you're off almost every holiday.
","1. The compensation plan. Oooh, the compensation plan...
In just one year, Personal Lines Sales has changed their compensation structure 4 times. The first compensation plan was a joke. You had to sell 60-70 policies before you were even eligible for commission, and then the commission could barely cover an electric bill. Then the second comp plan came out, and it was mildly better, as it focused on efficiency over volume. Payouts increased, and people who had begun looking elsewhere for a career reconsidered to stay for a bit longer. The third compensation plan came out, and payouts REALLY increased. This was a great few months, because people who hit their goals made good money, but top performers were being rewarded handsomely. People were taking home $2-$3k in commission alone. But I guess the Hartford hadn't counted on people being motivated to exceed their goals now that they were getting good checks, because just as quickly as that new comp plan came, it was replaced by one that raised quota and closing percentage goals, but reduced payouts to literal dollars per policy UNLESS you're able to greatly exceed those goals. Yeah, you read that right. Agents made money and the Hartford's response was to turn around and make it harder for them to make money. And I'm sure in another 4 months, we will be changing the comp structure AGAIN.
2. The sales culture is barely a sales culture. 
The company has been around for over 200 years, which is really shocking when you see the sales culture is still in its toddler stage. If you're a well-rounded or seasoned sales professional, personal lines sales at the Hartford is not for you. You cannot have your own leads, nor can you follow up with a lead without manager approval. They expect you to close the sale on the very first call, in under 1050 seconds for your handle time. Considering our target demographic is AARP members over the age of 50, this is very difficult to accomplish, unless you plan on aggressively selling, which ends up hurting your customer service score (because guess what? this demographic doesn't like being aggressively sold to). They follow the Integrity Sales model--which is a fantastic model. However, they only want you to follow certain parts of it. Much of integrity selling focuses on qualifying and prospecting--which the company is adamantly against because they want quantity over quality, which goes against its core values of writing sustainable, long-term business (poor quality leads seldom stay on the books long enough for the agent to make commission, let alone yield the company a profit). In summary, we are not a sales floor. We are a contact center and cashiers. 
3. Poor Change Management.
Change management is never easy, but they got really sloppy on this one. First, they canned directors and other leadership. Then, they began canning poor performers, while in the process of rolling out more aggressive ad campaigns (mail, magazines, national tv ads). With the sudden cut of staff, and a sudden rush of call volume, people became overwhelmed quickly. In a matter of two weeks, dozens more quit without notice. Customer service ratings tanked because of long hold times and agents being burnt out, and abandon rates increased. Sales volume remained steady, but because of the volume of calls, you're quoting more, which reduces your closing percentage effectiveness, which reduces your overall payout. The Hartford is reaping the benefits of the increased marketing, but agents are back to the way it was a year ago: working more, and making less.

The culture has come a long way over the years and the company truly cares about the communities nearby. I've met some wonderful people here and talent is truly top notch.
","It can be really hard to move beyond a certain level. Recruiters seem to favor bringing in external talent (fresh eyes) versus focusing on raising internal talent up. It can feel like you have to walk on water to meet the expectations for an ""exceeds"" rating or be considered for another level. Working as hard as you can doesn't always mean you'll be recognized and there is some corporate politics. It would also be nice if managers were more open to flex time or remote work. We still have some managers who are old school and want to see employees every day. If you live in some parts of CT, the commute into Hartford sucks and that adds to the stress of the workday. Pay is decent, but not necessarily equal across the board against market value.
Advice to Management
Be fair and open in your willingness to give internal people a chance. Sometimes you have to take a risk on someone who has a proven track record of results. Don't keep changing the requirements so they feel like they'll never get ahead. Even though the corporate talk-track promotes lateral moves (which are great), the reality for employees is that their level does have an impact on bonus potential (target pool %), which is significantly different from one level to the next.

Thu Aug 01 2019, Customer Service,"Clinton, NY",Current Employee ,Awful place to work long-term,5,"Nice cubicles. Every other pro has an equal con though. Coworkers are nice, but many of them gossip about each other. Decent pay and benefits, but our insurance has terrible copays. Work/life balance is ok, but if you get sick you might as well quit, because they dont give leave of absence.
","There is effectively no 'advancement' at this company, all the movement is 'lateral' which using their own terminology. You may go from one billing department to another, but you WILL NOT be able to pursue any higher positions, ie, they only hire managers from outside the Hartford. My managers have been hired directly from MetLife and AAA so far. They seem to have a high turnover in management.

Everything is based on metrics: raises, remote working options, and lateral movement to name a few, but management does not know how any of the metrics actually work. They also do not cultivate or work with their employees to meet company standards, their only attitude is 'figure it out yourself' but that is nearly impossible when they also want you taking phone calls 100% of your day. This is very frustrating and is used as a tool to block people from raises/bonuses who managers don't like personally. The frustration is multiplied when the metrics program/system malfunctions regularly and misrepresents how much work you are doing.

As far as culture, the Hartford really does not care about its employees, we often make suggestions that would make our jobs easier and more reliable, and management flat out ignores us, then does whatever they think is right, usually wasting millions of company dollars. We have thrown away almost a billion dollars in the past 2 years on computer programs that were conceived by an oblivious corporate person, and when those programs were to be implemented, they failed miserably and were discontinued. Because of how bad all the programs and systems are, we are far less able to help customers, which makes us look bad as CSR. There are also REGULAR system outages. That money could have gone to fixing the current problems we are facing in our systems. The Hartford ""Cultute"" is to delegate and put blame on CSR when things go wrong.

","Employee morale is low in Risk Engineering. If you voice your concerns, regardless of professionalism, you're told how you're wrong and your voice is ignored. Metrics are said to ""bring value to our customers"", but they really don't. It's a facade for upper management. Short-term vision and silly metrics make for a culture of fear that has been cultivated. No focus on the customers is concerning. Tasks and ""to-dos"" are always added, and never taken away.

Systems aren't good. When they make one fix, more issues arise. They push efficiency and tell us how to be efficient, but their micromanaging halts all efficiency efforts. High turnover has been abundant throughout the country, and there are no signs of that slowing down. Either drink the koolaid or get out. They seem to only show good responses on Employee Opinion Surveys. However, employees talk amongst one another and dissatisfaction seems to abundant.

","The comp plan is complicated. You have to use an excel spread sheet or the gimmicky dashboard to see if you going to make your bonus. You will see hundreds of dollars disappear from your bonus in one bad sales day then they will punish you for quote avoidance. Never heard that term until coming here. Most companies want you to quote often because you're getting in front of the customer. More quotes, more opportunity to make a sale. It is Business Management 101 that if your sales staff becomes disenchanted with the comp plan or it becomes too challenging it will promote bad behaviors and lower morale. Marketing uses dated ideas such as offering ""free"" gift promotions in order to drive business but it wastes the sales staff time and company money. The customer has no real interest in buying a policy even if they are saving money, because they only want the free gift and if they don't get in the mail within a few days they are calling back wasting the sales staff demanding answers to when they will receive it, who do they need to speak to get is faster, can they pick the color or can the Hartford over night it. How is this productive?

Value all employees , not just those in the mentor program. That kind of favoritism is demoralizing. Also demoralizing is the daily public display of everyone's ""numbers"" from the day before. Need better pay and better work hours, should not have to work every other weekend, the work life balance is terrrible, employees have families and kids too. Fix the systems and improve resources so we can do our jobs better and easier. Fix the bonus system and actually make the requirements fair and attainable for your employees as the base pay is low for what is expected in the job.

It has amazing benefits, very competitive pay, and the job is not really ""hard"" once you get the hang of it! Leadership is really great and incentives are fantastic! Just a solid company!
","I honestly cannot think of any ""Cons"" regarding the company itself. I loved being a part of this enterprise and hate that I couldn't stay. I resigned by choice and it wasn't because of leadership or the way the company was ran but actually because of the building. The job is mentally draining but that's not uncommon for a call center. However, when you combine the job with the very bland, drab, beige, and overall outdated atmosphere that sits in this building, it does something to you. I worked for another call center prior to joining this company and I had interviewed at a couple different call centers before ever joining The Hartford and this building had the least amenities by far, the plainest furniture, the worst lighting (hardly any natural light), even with the blinds open. I dreaded walking into this building every day. I tried to personalize my cubicle as much as possible to help but it just didn't work. This could be a 5 star rating but the building robs 2 stars. I know for a fact that I'm not the only person that feels this way but I'm sure most people don't speak up about it because they believe that it will probably never change. I personally will never recommend someone to work for The Hartford in San Antonio if they even slightly struggle with their mental health. I hope that for the sake of their current employees who suffer in silence, that a change is made.
Advice to Management
I am not sure who is in charge of the real estate for The Hartford but my advice to them would be to please take my feedback seriously. I'm sure that there are much more serious things to be worrying about and I know that a change like this can't happen overnight but it really plays a huge part in the whole ""loving to come to work"" culture that is so focused on. I don't have much to gain from it any longer since I've departed but it is something that needs to be addressed. I don't necessarily think that everyone feels the way that I do about and some people may not even recognize or care for that matter how the building impacts their work experience so maybe sending out a poll or survey might help gather enough feedback to make a change.

Mon Oct 01 2018," Director, Commercial Lines","Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,Why you should strongly be considering The Hartford as your next Employer,8,"Highly ethical company, recognized 12 times by Ethisphere.

Highly focused leadership that is taking this company in the right direction. I see it in the decisions they are making & the outcomes. Where we are today, and the bright future we're heading towards, are testimonies to how effective they have been.

The Hartford has always been an active community partner & it is something we’re all proud of!

HIG is really supportive of its employees. They offer a challenging work environment, flexible work arrangements, a comprehensive & I think rather valuable benefit plan. They pay a portion of costs & also contribute to your 401k & health spending acct. HIG truly values diversity & inclusion, and they are very proactive in recognizing talent, offering plenty of opportunity for development and advancement. This is a safe, welcoming & supportive work environment for everyone!

I've worked for The Hartford since 1997. I truly feel like I am part of something and make a difference through what I do, and how I do it. I know that what I've done in the past & how Hartford leverages me today aligns with its business direction & plans. This adds such incredible value to the work experience and I think it is a rare opportunity. I feel respected, sought after, for all that I bring to the table. Everyone can expect the same from The Hartford: you perform, you are valued, you are recognized, you will advance.

I am not interested in even considering a position anywhere else - and not because this is ""familiar"", or because this is ""comfortable"". It is because I am valued, challenged every day (and in the right way!) and highly satisfied.
","The biggest downside to me has been working in Hartford CT itself. (Current position required move.) I do understand the need to have certain positions situated in the home office, and it is a great experience - so don't let this stop you!

I've seen a lot of lay-offs (expense cutting initiatives) over the years. That's not a con specific to HIG - it's a risk at any company, really, but bears mentioning. I will add Hartford does try to place employees elsewhere internally if there is a fit.

The decision making process has always been a struggle as long as I've worked here. HIG has tried various programs to help improve the process and make people feel more empowered but I think we still struggle here. 

Settling on a decision, rather than taking reasonable risks that lead to better outcomes - that is still failure & folks lose sight of that more often than I'd like to see/experience.

","The pay is below par with the industry. Bonuses are also below par, or non-existent. 
Since they changed CEOs they changed things and it only got worse. 

There is no retirement pension. 

Training is intense through webex with like 8 other people, not with someone individually showing you. It takes a long time. They have webex quizzes for everything, including company policies. For some things, it would be better to read a piece of paper and sign it so you can get on with your work. 

There are some long term employees, but that was when they had a different CEO and the work process was different. I have seen whole departments in the office change. I have seen one long term employee be forced into retirement. Since them people were leaving and all new employees took their place. That was not a good sign. 
This is a good company to learn and intern, but not for a long term career. They do not have a retirement pension. 

Too much micromanagement. The coaching can be disruptive and can only give you negative feedback. Managers will ask other teammates about you so just be aware. They say they don't base your performance on metrics but they shove it in your face when you're behind and/or below your peers. This is very much a high pressure job, and it isn't even an executive position. 

They can reassign a manager to you, after you gained a good rapport with the manager you had and give you someone who is quite different, not easy to get along with, very clinical, and/or only cares about their numbers But it doesn't stop there . They can reassign of people you assist, and/or reassign the agents they work with is not a good idea. They say they do this to balance the workload. It's never a good idea to switch up people who already have a good professional relationship with those they work with and the agents they work with. Agents told me they were confused and frustrated. 

Some of the platforms used to process accounts on the computer are complicated and take too long to process one account. I had to help show some of the newly hired people I worked with how to use them because they were lost. And this took time out of my work. They have streamlined some of the process. Even though this is a large 200 year old company, they need to get with the times. 

You have a backup person, but don't be surprised if that person doesn't have time to help you. You can come back from vacation and nobody did any of your work, even though you caught up before you left, you are back to where you started. 

You are forced to add responsibilities to your job, but not willing to pay for it when you are actually doing the work. I was hired for one department, only to have another department added that I had to be trained for and it added to my workload, but not my paycheck. The ongoing training to learn the new procedures and department accounts eats up the time and your work just piles up. 

Too many team meetings and town hall meetings. This is disruptive to the heavy workload. Some of these team meetings were a waste of time. 

If you are non-exempt, you don't always get the OT when you need to catch up in work or do a special project. It depends on your manager. 

Morale in the office sucks. No real parties for the holidays, unless they invite you to join a small group to go out. The office is a quiet place. I only went to lunch a few time with others. Mostly they stick to their small groups. The office manager doesn't care.
Advice to Management
Employees are not robots. They are not just statistics. They need positive feedback and better morale and more employees to balance the workload.. They need to get the OT for the heavy workload they do. Management needs to stop with the over-micromanagement and let the do their jobs and trust them. Get with the times and use computer systems that don't take so long for one account. Management also needs to care about the good professional rapport that is gained and maintain that with the clients by not reassigning them to different people. The company needs to show their appreciation with going deeper into their pockets to pay for the talent they hire and invest in. Value your employees more.

Allowing more flexibility with remote work would greatly improve the work/life balance for working parents when there are delayed school openings due to weather conditions--it can be difficult arranging for child care at the last minute when you learn your child's school will be delayed 90 minutes or two hours and you have to get to work.

Sat Jun 02 2018, LTD Ability Analyst,"Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,The Problem With The Hartford (Disability Claims) 4 Points,12,It is a growing company with lots of good benefits. For the most part the people that work here are good people with some bad apples (like anywhere). If you are interested in working remotely then this might be the company to look into. Wage wise you could get lucky as some are paid significantly more than others doing the same role. They do offer annual bonuses and merit increases (which is rare in this type of position). However please read on to the ,"
Cons
There are 4 specific cons. Please note you will need to attend a 7-week training class and must pass the final exam at the end. If you do not pass well… the job is not for you. However before you even apply to this position and waste your valuable time and energy really consider the following. This is a very high stress type of job and work environment. You must have thick skin and you must have a Type A personality. If you do not…move on and apply for something else. Please read on.

Unrealistic expectations: The work environment will be that of being stressed out every single day. You will be monitored and scrutinized. The workload will be unreasonable and massive. Although you need to understand the policy and how it relates to the situation at hand as well as understand medical and financials and have good analytical skills… the job is truly task driven. You must complete your tasks within a certain time frame or else you are put on a list. Once on this list you will be harped on and looked on as if you are a non-performing employee. As soon as this happens micromanagement begins. Then the termination process. So either you understand the job or you do not. If you do not you will be terminated accordingly in a relatively short period of time (verbal warning – written warning). Upper management in disability claims only want Type A personalities working in their claim shop. You must perform. If you do not you will be fired. The mentality is the Company has no time to offer you extra training (“We put you through 7 weeks. You should know the job!”) or cut you any slack. Do not believe when management say they want to help you. Management does not. They have to put up an act. They use politically correct terms like “learning opportunities” to satisfy the EEOC. Management and “smart alcek” co-workers will state “USE KMT!” KMT. KMT is a way to push you off so management does not have to spend time with you. So ask yourself this: Do you have a Type A Personality? Are you able to handle high stress and high scrutiny from your boss? Are you able to handle your co-workers claims when they are out and handle your own at the same time (this is truly unrealistic and you will be thrown under the bus by your co-workers often)? Can you push yourself to the limits to get your tasks within standards in a 40hr week (You will be a non-exempt EE)? Are you OK with NO Work Life Balance? 

Poor Leadership: It is of the opinion of many employees who feel there are some senior leaders to managers to TLs that are not truly qualified for the role they are in. Senior leaders only want results. They DO NOT care about why the numbers are poor. They only want results. They want “instant gratification” so they can go back to the executives to show how well their org is doing. Thus it is communicated from the top down (TLs) that if someone is struggling with their job… terminate them. This type of leadership is something you do not want to experience. It creates a very highly pressurized work environment. It’s an every man and woman for themselves. Throw you under the bus"" tactic is used often by many. When employees are openly discussing job searches and job interviews with competitors, being unhappy, comparing salary, comparing reviews you know there is an issue.

Remote workforce: There are A LOT OF employees that work at home. This is a fatal flaw. In a claim shop you need to have people together and face to face. Sure they say we use Skype and video. It is not the same dynamic as going into a conference room with everyone sitting down in front of each other to discuss a claim. When you have to talk to someone in person face to face vs on Skype on video, trust me it is a different dynamic and definitely a different result. For the most part most do work in the office but there are certain claim areas that are fully remote. Not a good idea. They say hey it gets us different talent across the USA. BS I say (saving on costs). In order to have a highly productive and highly efficient claim shop – you need to have the workers in the shop working together face to face in person. Nuff said. 

Badging: The company has a certification program where if you meet certain criteria and a “board approves” you earn a digital badge on your company profile. Won’t go into the specifics but the concept is flawed. It is nice to be recognized for proven skills and accomplishments however the badging program has turned into a game where people try to out do each other. They say if you want to post internally you need certain badges. This turns into people treating others differently. Looking down on them if you do not have this badge or that badge or this advanced badge, etc… It creates a work environment where you must constantly prove yourself to everyone and then be treated differently. So know if you come here you will be pressured into getting all your badges. If you do not you will be looked down on and picked on (just like grade school). It’s just how it goes. Concept is flawed as it creates animosity, dirty competition, formal HR complaints and undue stress. You already got enough on your plate. 

Just be warned although you work in the disability claim shop you most likely will be going on disability yourself based on being stressed out 24/7/365. There are only a small percentage of people that can truly do this grueling style of work. Make sure you understand all of this before accepting a job offer for this role.
Advice to Management
A total paradigm shift is needed. Badging must be eliminated as it reinforces negative behavior vs high performing employees. Claim org management and audit style must change. They state EQRs are holistic and a chance for a learning opportunity when in reality it is punitive and a way to document poor performance. This audit process needs to be revamped with a different focus where it truly helps an EE to improve and learn.

PTO is also generous but constant turnover and a heavily inexperienced staff means you rarely get to use it.
","Leadership boys club is allowed to operate outside the boundaries of professional ethics and morality without repercussion or consequences perpetuating a culture of fear. Keep your mouth shut, head down and opinions to yourself or you will be targeted for bruising their egos. Don’t be fooled by the constant requests for anonymous feedback and suggestions, they aren’t listening, they don’t care and it’s not anonymous. Trust no one. Lack of accountability means employees and leaders who are well known for being unqualified and inept are allowed to continue wreaking havoc while putting the burden of work on those that are experienced and dedicated, bringing many of them to their breaking point. Mass exodus of employees over the last few years is not a coincidence. Leadership views everyone as replaceable and those that leave as traitors. Complete lack of common sense has created a process-heavy, tunnel vision environment where no one ever gets to feel successful.

- Large, 18,000+ employee company with multiple business lines means there is plenty of room for growth and professional development
- Strong leadership who communicates often and with transparency
- Company committed to strong values, supporting various employee resource groups (women, black, Hispanic, asian, disabled, military, etc.), and giving to local communities and charities
- Allows flexible work hours and partial/full work from home options, with modernized offices and free onsite gym and parking, good work/life balance

Wed Feb 07 2018,Anonymous,"Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,The Best of Corporate America,1,"Executive leadership team listens to employees - several times over the past several years decisions were made as a direct result of employee feedback.

Pay & Benefits - Let's face it, we always want to be paid more, pay less for better benefits, etc. but compared to industry peers and the work we do, I feel The Hartford pays competitively. Bonuses are typically generous and we are compensated fairly for the work we do. Our benefits are not cheap but that's a national issue rather than a company one. Health insurance policy is generous and offers several options to meet your families needs.

The Hartford has a strong commitment to the communities and the world in which we live. The company has a strong community presence and employees receive eight hours of paid time off every year to volunteer with a non-profit of their choice. There is also an environmental action team that organizes ""green"" initiatives throughout the year and the company is always looking for creative ways to further reduce its carbon footprint. These activities are reinforced and encouraged by our senior leaders as well.

Flexibility - There are many areas of the company that allow flex-time, remote working options, etc. The Hartford demands a lot of your time - it is a hard-working culture. It is not uncommon to work more than 40 hrs a week depending upon your role but the flexibility allowed significantly improves work/life balance. Personally, I appreciate the tradeoff. Do I have to work long hours at times? Sure. But if it means I can work remotely when it's snowing or I have a doctor's appointment, that's a trade I will happily make.
","The rate of change in the organization can be overwhelming. While the executive team remains relatively stable, management changes at lower levels are constant. Many times it's for a positive reason (internal opportunity/advancement) but it can leave employees unsettled and constantly required to adjust to a new management style. It isn't uncommon to have a new manager every 8-14 months in some areas of the company.

The job-tier system at The Hartford can be very inconsistent and sometimes creates a barrier to getting work done. 
 - There are employees doing the same role / same responsibilities with two different job titles/salary tiers. This issue has definitely improved as management has reduced the use of promotions as a reward, instead using bonus pools to recognize strong performance as intended. Promotions are now awarded more appropriately for employees who take on increased responsibility rather than performing their job well. 
 - There is a portion of the org who will only work with / take guidance from employees at their tier level or above. It can be a very hierarchical organization. Lower level employees in some areas have difficulty being heard or miss opportunities for leadership exposure simply because of where they sit on an org chart.

The expectation of you is to take ""80 calls a day."" Thats it. There is no thought process to take agent burn out into consideration, you can't even do training until before or after your shift to maximize your time being on the phone. Zero work-life balance as theres a bidding system for days off thats not friendly to new people or struggling agents.

You need to teach your staff the importance of strong interpersonal skills. They lead to effective teams and an enjoyable work environment. What I witnessed with The Hartford was disgusting. People being rude and accusatory to others, while management sat and watched. Nothing was ever addressed. You're paying people to be directors, part of that is LEADING your team and correcting things when they are wrong. 
You have way too much dead weight. People who come to collect their paycheck, while putting in the most minimal amount of work they can.

Find true leaders. People who command respect and truly lead are in very short supply as the dead wood continues to hang on.

A good test is to see who walks away from an earnings call thinking only of the stock price rather than the core business and opportunities.

In this day and age the insurance world will continue to see an increase in claim volume, the massive storms are not going away, thefts (personal and commercial) continue to rise, etc. You need to hire more adjusters.

Thu Sep 28 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Scottsdale Inbound Sales,7,"Nice new building. Generally friendly atmosphere. Benefits available immediately upon hire. Generous paid time off.
","Inadequate, poorly prioritized training. 
Paltry bonus program. 
Kindergarten-style management approach. 
Order-taking protocol, not true sales scenario (outbound calls not allowed without special permission; direct callbacks from customers not allowed; etc.).
High attrition rate. 

Training for unlicensed new hires to prepare for the State exam is woefully inadequate. A high percentage of the unlicensed trainees fail the exam, and not because they are incapable or do not perform their due diligence. Most insurance companies hire an outside consulting firm like Kaplan and allow two solid weeks for pre-test training and preparation, with Internet tools and study aids for use outside the office. Not here--training is in-house by managers, many of whom only recently obtained their license. Studying at home is discouraged. 

Training for licensed hires is also inadequate. Training period is much more brief than advertised. Far too much emphasis on a sales concept which could be summed up in a couple of paragraphs and less than 30 minutes, yet trainees are taken through a redundant program that stretches on and on ad nauseum. Meanwhile basic skills and critical information are given superficial treatment, leading to frustration when employees are put on the phones. 

It's a tough sell--The Hartford is extremely risk averse, resulting in a high percentage of prospects being disqualified compared to other insurers. Additionally rates are rarely competitive. Employees are told to steer customers away from prioritizing price, and instead to sell the value of the company. However mass marketing campaigns trumpet the claim that switching to The Hartford will save customers an average of $300 per year (accompanied by the typical fine print disclaimers), thus prospects call with the expectation of savings and are typically disappointed when receiving a quote. System glitches and poor software design lead to long call times, customers being put on hold for extended periods, etc. A relatively small percentage of sales reps meet the minimum requirement to qualify for a bonus even at the lowest tier, which at that level pays small amount in additional pay above the base hourly wage. The bonus program is paltry compared to other insurers. 

Management interaction with employees is condescending and childish, although in all fairness they do sincerely attempt to be personable and avoid micromanaging. 

Benefits are expensive and not as robust as many other companies. 

The attrition rate is extremely high. Reps who have experience at other insurance companies are particularly disillusioned and many don't stick around long. Management solicits feedback regularly but no discernible change is evident.
Advice to Management
Restructure training to focus on important skills and processes instead of placing so much emphasis and time on shallow psychological sales concepts. 

Enlist experts to provide adequate and professional training for unlicensed new hires. 

Upgrade bonus program. 

Provide better benefits. 

Allow callbacks and outgoing calls so reps can act as actual sales agents, not order takers.

The term that has long come to mind is ""soul-crushing"". Even the normal bureaucracy of the Dilbert-world of business is that way to some extent, but The Hartford, or at least the division I'm working in, goes well beyond that. It neither understands nor respects its staff, and more deeply, seems to be a world of lies and pretense, which is brought home hard every time one must work on a document extolling the company's supposed virtues, which are manifestly different from the ways it actually operates. Any sane person wishes to say ""the emperor has no clothes"" or ""we are working in a madhouse"", but of course it is regarded as the cardinal sin to point it out. You are caught between the very reasonable concern about what being in such an environment is doing to your soul and the equally reasonable fear that leaving would be a financial disaster.

Horrible healthcare premium for OK coverage

Advice to Management
At interview they have managers telling people how simple promotions are going to be without telling them about the difficulty of the 5 point metrics process. Metrics scoring is like a juggler keeping all 5 balls in the air at the same time. It's the sales call scoring system. It has to be right on the 6 mo. review in order for a person to be promoted. Something is liable to fall, but they're welcome to apply again in 6 mos. IF the position is still available, IF your number are up. Also, one would have to be ""mentored"" by that manager from that other department you want to be promoted to for another period of time IF that manager has the time for all that and feels you're a good ""fit"". Of course all that could be bypassed if he/she likes the same sports team or already knows you outside the company, likes you, or if you have the better credentials (i.e., a Master's in the field or something). In other words, yes, some people are favored. I've seen it. Come in and in 2 months... BAM... promoted. Don't work here unless the job you apply for is probably the one you want for a while is all I'm saying. 

Everything else I read about The Hartford, not wanting people but robots is true. It's an old company hinged on old values. It's not looking for superstars, I get that, but it's not looking to give up any money either. No promotions, no raises, and no commissions. It's not a salespersons place to be anymore. If you're in sales, keep walking.

","The pay is decent although below market value for most similar jobs. They promise amazing bonuses for hitting incentives but you don't see those bonuses for about 6 to 8 weeks after you've actually hit the monthly incentive goals. It is an EXTREMELY metrics based environment every second of your day down to how many times you go to the bathroom is measured out and affects how you are viewed as an employee. When hired they make it sound like there is a lot of growth within the company but once you are actually on the job it becomes very apparent that is not the case. They do a lot of external hiring for out of call center jobs. They do offer quite a bit of time off but it is very difficult to actually use that time off if you want a weekend off or even to go on vacation there have been occasions where requested time off months in advance did not get approved all of the time so it has to be taken as ""unscheduled time"" which counts against you. So if you only like taking Tuesday-Thursday off this is the place for you! Also, they ask for a minumum of a half hour per week overtime when you start but they push you to work more than that so you can ""look good to upper management"" there will also be certain days that they more or less insist everyone has to work overtime and if you don't it looks pretty bad. It's a very micromanaged environment and can be incredibly soul crushing after a while no matter how happy-go-lucky of a person you may be.
Advice to Management
Give people a chance to do something other than the call center your turnover rates in these positions are high because it's a call center job which everyone knows isn't very fun but at least if employees know there's a chance they can actually progress within the company they'll tough it out. Also, ""the Hartford way"" can use some work don't tell people you're going to have all these coaching sessions and team collaborations just to cancel them because it gets ""too busy"". If you want to know how to better assist your customers you should probably talk to the people who actually spend their entire day on the phone with them.

","The upper management in Western Workers' Compensation leaves a lot to be desired. They are the whole reason I left. They do not get to know their staff and some of the managers in the office actually try to avoid speaking to anyone. If you are like me and need to feel like you belong to an inter-connected group this is not the group for you. Management says they encourage togetherness and teamwork but actions speak louder than words. The RVP never even learned how to spell my name. 

Favoritism is big here. They will create made-up jobs for those who tend to brown nose. But everyone else is treated like human capitol. I am the type of person who gets satisfaction out of my job and out of contributing to something but being treated like I was just a number at a desk and anyone else could replace be was very disheartening. 

The company culture is good outside of the Workers' Compensation department. If work-life balance is important to you this is not the job for you. They are always adding more reports designed to help us with our jobs but they are mandatory and time consuming. I was always logging on at home during the weeknights and on weekends. 

One of the Department Managers in Phoenix also does not like to allow employees to have benefits like working from home 1-2 days a week unless they are single moms. I had to fight and fight for the right to stay home once a week but moms were being given phones without asking. He also thinks taking that benefit away should be a punishment for people who fall behind. 

The training is abysmal and they are fully aware of it and have failed to make any improvements.

","Back to back to back calls. Ridiculous expected metrics. Low pay for industry, everyone lost their performance bonus even though OUR team was one of the highest performing.

You will lose a lot of experienced and motivated people because of the pay cut and the rate increases with irate customers. A few simple ways to solve: Pay more (this is good for morale, duh!) Don't hammer tenured reps with retention calls. Admit that the metrics are ridiculous. Hire enough people so that saying goodbye to one customer is not half a second away from answering the phone with the next customer.

Thu Jun 01 2017, Outside Property Claims Representative,"Hartford, CT",Former Employee ,Professional Property Adjusters Beware,10,"Remote Work is nice. They have a nice logo and ignorant management so you can pay whatever amount you like on a claim to make it go away. The team leaders and Field Managers mostly have no idea how to work a property claim so they won't know the difference. Just my opinion.
","All of this is my opinion. The Hartford became the worst in the last 18 months. The company switched outside Property Reps to hourly and are having them work 60 to 80 claims a month. The outside reps now basically stay home all day staring at a computer reviewing contractor estimates. The Hartford is trying to save money by reducing staff, not use IA's and just desk handling anything below $100k. The middle management has been charged with cutting expenses. Never mind the fact the company over pays nearly every single claim now, they saved a couple million on salary while over paying $100 million on claim payments. Since middle management is meeting staff expense cutting goals (while gutting quality staff) they get bonuses while the company gets destroyed. 

Contractors are having a field day though. 

Again, this is just my opinion from working at the Hartford.
Advice to Management
Hire some middle management that know insurance, not just certified change agents and auto reps. You made promises when you wrote insurance contracts and you are not keeping the promises you made. I cannot figure out how you still have the AARP contract. All you are doing is gaming the JD Power survey. 

Advice to HR and benefits: Now that the job is awful, the fact that you eliminated the pension, took the cars from reps and branded them and still require payments from adjuster salaries, and bonuses are smaller, you have left no reason to be a loyal employee. 

The only reason you have any outside staff today? Not enough other companies have openings. Again, all of this is just my opinion.

","This company actively recruited me from a competitor and then proceeded to lay me off along with others 2 years to the day after being hired. Nice huh? Classless and clueless. Huge micromanagement issue in GA office, specifically BTA and Blanket lines. Never in my 25 years have I dealt with more rude, demanding reps who will throw you under the bus. Did I say rude? UNrealistic expectations with regard to workload. Just because people on the team regularly work 10 hour days and weekends ( but will not openly admit to mgmt) just to manage their workload doesn't mean it's right. That's a problem. Wake up. Because you lost a GREAT employee. One that was loyal to a fault. Stay away from The Hartford. Big promises. Big disappointment. I wish I had stayed where I was. 

Oh and I was hired to Underwrite but my unit was doing everything BUT underwriting. Glorified admin job with very low pay. My knowledge and experience was wasted. I could Underwrite circles around other folks since I'm used to actually analyzing experience data and formulating case rates. Not just mindlessly punching numbers into a spreadsheet for a premium.

","If you somehow thrive on stress, this is the job for you. The training seems decent but as soon as you're cut loose, your team leader will start loading on the work (and most have never processed a claim themselves so they have no idea what the workload feels like). If you somehow manage to keep up with your work, you will be asked to put aside getting ahead, which is never, to help members of your team if they're behind. The caseload is impossible. They expect you to answer your phone whenever it rings and there are daily emails with a chart of every analyst with their phone metrics. You essentially spend the whole day on the phone getting screamed at and your manager DEFINITELY doesn't want to help you when a situation gets escalated. And most escalated issues are due to the workload. There is no way you can process new claims, call a new claim ain't to introduce yourself (WHY is this a thing? Send an email!) and then try to maintain the other 200 files in your caseload in 40 hours a week. There is barely overtime and when there is, if you don't use it, you will be ratted out by your teammates. Your teammates bully you to help them constantly. If you take time off, you're told your work will be divvied to the team. Nope. That doesn't happen. If you or your child gets sick and you call off, guess what, you will have a heap of work the next day you'll never get through. Your worth is based on metrics and if you give any negative feedback to a manager, don't worry, it'll come up on your review. The accountability stops at the analyst. The team leaders and management only care about numbers. I can't tell you how people I've seen suffer panic attacks at the desk or call off to go see a psychiatrist. I worked with one person who had to be on heavy anti-anxiety mess just to get through the day. They eventually quit because their health and mental state was deteriating so quickly. Subsequently, that same employee received a letter from The Hartford saying they made an error with her paycheck and overpaid her. She had to pay back the amount in 10 business days or it would be sent to a collection agency. That said, for customers, if they're overpaid, they'll write it off if it's under a certain amount. But nope, not for the employees. Pay up or get ready for the nasty phone calls.
Advice to Management
You have GOT to listen to your employees. The stress is ridiculous. The turnaround time goals are impossible. The loss of talent is absurd. You need more analysts so you can lower the caseloads. The customers are people suffering from probably the worst thing in their lives (cancers, surgeries, inability to work) and the analysts are under so much pressure they can't actually focus on customers.

","Reported to 4 different directors in the previous 12 months. Constant re-organization of staffing but no real changes to how business is done. Poor communication is a constant issue - from management to employees and across teams. Upper management is stretching staffing resources very thin so it takes months to replace an employee that leaves - you are left with the burden of their work. Working overtime is an expectation 6 months out of the year. They will never be properly staffed because of a broken staffing model and a refusal to see the writing on the wall. Employee moral is at an all time low. Company culture varies wildly by department and office. Survey results are not taken seriously and are given back to employees to find solutions to low scores. There is a lack of innovation at the Hartford - internal red tape keeps anyone from implementing an idea to fix problem. Decisions take too long to be made - a problem we have had for years. No longer a pay for performance environment. Career progression is a single track with limited opportunities and if you are in a remote/satellite office you are handicapped.
