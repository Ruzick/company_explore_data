I worked at Delta Air Lines part-time
Pros
Never gets boring ..everyday is different . Meet and work with interesting people from all over the globe. Travel benefits are unbeatable. Delta is a company that gives back to the community they sponser many charitable events and encourage employees to participate
Cons
Can be very stressful during delays and bad weather . Staffing is always a problem . Expected to wear many hats at once. Even with years at the job it was difficult to get days off . Shifts are very non traditional ie early morning or late evening start times

Fri Jan 22 2021, Ramp Agent Seasonal Ready Reserve,"Atlanta, GA",Current Employee ,"Long hard days, but rewarding in its own way",0,"First of all, know what you are getting into: You will be tired, you will be working in the elements, you will have days you hate the idea of looking at another damn plane coming into your gate. You get quality uniforms though. 

However, I knew it was a seasonal job and that I had some of the best flight benefits in the industry. As a college student the summer work and pay were totally worth it. And my family was able to make extensive use of the flying as well. We got our moneys worth, and you get a daily full body workout to boot. 
Additionally you get a yearly profit sharing bonus - unknown if theyre giving out anything for covid, I didnt even get called to work last summer (indefinite standby).
","The volume of baggage. I was working international and wondering why i was always tired, so i did the math: 4.5 planes(off load is half, onload is half) each load is about 200 bags, and each bag is about ~30lbs. 

So, 30* 200*4.5 = 27,000lbs or in other words: I stacked, pushed, onload or offloaded 13.5 US Tons PER DAY. 
You are an ""industrial athlete"" and need to watch your health. Do not try to be a hero and bust your *butt for a company paying less than $15 an hour. View it as a decent summer job plus a gym membership and a chance to see the world ( I went to France, Argentina, and a few US places. Some in first class, neat experience)

Also, The elements. You get rained on alot and I worked the winter once > MISERABLE! I remember standing at a gate in full winter gear with the rain gear on top, watching the rain fall sideways in the super strong wind, shivering with soaked gloves near freezing my hands (it was sitting at like 35degrees so no snow) thinking that I had never wanted to quit so badly in my life. Wet, cold, tired and hungry. Great for morale, builds character I guess.
Advice to Management
Overall decent, prior to covid the main grumblings were that they reduced the profit sharing for us grunts (below wing crews). Apparently the year before they had paid a certain portion of profit sharing, then when we did even better in 2019 they paid only a fraction above last time. Rumor had it the reason was bc the pilots union and the Flight Attendants unions renegotiated and demanded more, so they reallocated from the below wing employees bc we didnt have a union.

Thats all rumors so idk their validity, but that IS what employees were feeling. So if management wants to address it they can send company wide emails showing the proportion of profit sharing company wide to fix any misleading info or maybe it was true, dunno.

Merit-based salary increases were great while I was there.
","After the transition to foreign outsourced IT support, and the sudden layoff of hundreds of loyal employees, (of which I was one) the Delta ""family"" is a thing of the past.

","The crew bases are considered by some as less desirable cities in which to live compared to some other airlines. As of 2021, the pilot bases are Atlanta, Detroit, New York, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Seattle. 

Flight attendants have those bases, and additional smaller bases in several other more desirable cities, including Orlando, San Francisco, Boston, Fort Lauderdale/Miami, and others. 

As a junior crewmember, you can expect to spend some time working out of New York or Detroit. When hiring ramps up, you may likely transfer to another base- possibly within 3-6 months, if you wish.

","The flight attendant lifestyle is a very different and sometimes challenging one. You have to be able to be away from home for days at a time, work inconsistent schedule/hours, commute to base if you choose not to live at your base hub, and more. It's not necessarily a bad thing, just one many need to understand before applying for the role. Everything is based on company seniority, so also understand that your schedule may not be ideal for quite some time.

Poor training, hands on fly by the seat of your pants training can be the big root cause of non teamwork or training inconsistencies, adding to matching computer issues delaying customers flights.

Fri Mar 20 2020, Business Analyst,"Atlanta, GA",Current Employee ,"Amazing company, but limited remote work flexibility",2,"The company is very much like a family (for employees, much less so for contractors). Many employees are happy to work as many hours as are needed to support the operation & their co-workers, but (manager-dependent) this isn't broadly expected of employees. In most areas (again, manager-dependent), employees are frequently reminded that family & personal life come first. The politics are sometimes difficult to fully ascertain and navigate (as with any company), but with proper coaching & mentoring it is navigable; coaching and mentoring is relatively easy to come by given how friendly & caring most employees are.

The benefits are overall very good. Health insurance c. 2020 is relatively affordable and definitely provides comprehensive coverage options (including life, dental, eye, etc.). Flight benefits are nice to have, but have limitations as the company continues to optimize load factor; however, HR has finally started to realign base salaries higher to reflect the flight benefits' decrease in value over time. The 401k program includes a 6% match & 2% additional DL contribution (so you contribute 6% from your check and your account receives 14% total), as well as provides financial advising/planning opportunities, and many other benefits focused on the overall wellbeing of employees.
","Delta's core operation is very much a 24/7 in-person operation (pilots, FAs, mtc, ops control, etc.). Therefore, most of the divisions supporting Delta's operation do not look kindly upon remote work. Most operations divisions only allow remote work when the employee cannot come into the office for a specified reason (illness, snow, etc.), and those days are few and far between, and must be arranged day-by-day with your manager. IT is by far the most flexible with allowing ongoing work-from-home opportunities, but still only allows employees to work from home 2 days per week (these policies are as of March 2020, and before COVID-19 isolation mandated WFH for all nonessential employees).

Additionally, the bureaucracy surrounding any changes (especially technology-related) is highly burdensome (as with any very large company). Some technology-related processes which should be smooth, automated, and/or quick (e.g. login requests, new hire laptop requests, etc.) take a very long time (when I first started with Delta as an analyst, i.e. needed a computer to do my job, I didn't have a laptop for the first 2 weeks, this was in 2010).

Again, as with any large company, middle/low management is a big problem in some divisions. executive expectations are very high (as they should be); in some divisions, directors & managers absorb the stress well and direct their teams in a less stress-inducing way, but this is not the norm by-and-large. Typically directors & managers directly pass the stress onto individual contributors (who don't have sufficient power or influence to fully solve the problems) without sufficiently helping/coaching them on what they can specifically do to help achieve a broader goal up to executive expectations. This is compounded when divisional goals are not aligned; this is especially problematic with IT focused on project funding & system uptime whereas the rest of the operation is focused on sustainability, reliability, innovation & customer experience.

While the Delta family is great, the way Delta handles the releasing of contractors is abhorrent (in relation to how much we brag about the greatness of the ""Delta family""). I have been a full time employee for my entire tenure, but have experienced many contractors who were great but may have needed coaching on one small thing who were unceremoniously fired (some over the phone, some just by notifying the contracting company that the person was no longer welcome at Delta, etc.) and escorted off campus immediately (with no advance warning and no opportunities to work on any performance issues they may have had). This has also been demonstrated by (unfortunately necessary) the immediate laying off of *all* contractors not essential to the operation (about half of the IT division) in the wake of COVID-19 revenue impact. Understand the need to cut, but I would think Delta would care a little bit more about the health & wellbeing of these people long-term (given that many of their contracting companies do not), especially given that some of these contractors are highly-productive, highly-contributing, members of our workforce, and many of them are SMEs for the work they do.
Advice to Management
1) Expand remote work options
2) Simplify/automate technology requests essential to daily work
3) Continue focus on middle-management training with extra focus on managing up and coaching employees to help them do what they can do to help towards the overall goal (not placing the stress of all of the things they can't control or influence on them)
4) Continue realigning salaries up to industry standard (especially for technology & analytics-focused roles)
5) Improve treatment of contractors (especially in coaching & dismissal situations)

Benefits are great. 401k match is hard to beat. Flight benefits are, mostly, truly wonderful and impossible to put a value on.
","If you are working in ATL at the GO - world class headquarters and you’ll have a lot of events around the campus. Not so much up in MSP. 
If by chance you end up finding a job posting for IT (rare as Delta relies HEAVILY on contractors) and one in MSP (even rarer) - welcome back to 1985! 
The work is interesting but you will end up carrying dead weight (people that should have retired 10 years ago) if you want to make your job tolerable. 
It will be interesting to see what happens to this office in 10 years’ time when just about the entire building has retired.
Advice to Management
Hire young talent in ATL and MSP and stop filling new roles with contractors. Most employees are within 5-10 years of retiring and the offices up in Minneapolis will be ghost towns by that time. Minneapolis is an excellent IT talent pool. Hire. Young. Talent. The young people I see around are the ones doing a majority of your work, and you will be in pain if they start leaving due to being suffocated by baby boomers and their excel spreadsheets.

","Challenging work environment, long hours, physically demanding. If you are a ready reserve agent you will not get health insurance, workman's compensation, paid sick days, and a lower pay cap than the benefited employees. Benefited employees are not exclusively leadership positions, most are working alongside the ready reserve employees. Delta is slowly getting rid of benefited employees, when a benefited employee is fired, or retires, or leaves the company Delta will not hire more benefited employees, they will hire ready reserve employees, for every 4 benefited employees that leaves, Delta will replace them with 4 ready reserve employees, or maybe 3 ready reserve and promote one ready reserve employee from within. To move up quicker you will probably need to relocate. In 2015 on average it took 4 to 5 years to become benefited. It now might take 7 years. Delta gives the airport managers too much power with very little oversight. They have been incredibly hypocritical when it comes to firing an employee, or promotion. I will say that there were a a number of employees I loved working with.

Sun Jan 19 2020,N/A,, ,World’s greatest airline,0,"Very fun company to work for if you are enthusiastic about airlines and aviation. 

While base compensation is not remarkable, Delta is rare in that it actually returns a meaningful portion of its earnings to its employees through profit sharing payments in February each year. This creates incentive alignment with shareholders, who also are receiving generous dividends, which I think is brilliant. Managerial employees also receive additional annual bonuses in February, which start at around one month’s base pay, so total bonus comp for a manager can easily exceed 2 months’ base pay in these recent years of profitability.

Other benefits are attractive - Including 9% total 401(k) employer contribution if employee is contributing at least 6%, and employer HSA contribution of $700+ annually if completing health tasks (checkups, screenings, etc.).
","With high load factors on Delta flights (great for profit sharing), actually using standby travel benefits can be difficult. 

Significant middle management turnover is disruptive to developing and executing on multi-year plans and projects.

Budget process is dysfunctional and poorly understood, and money is sometimes wasted that could be returned to shareholders and employees.

Office environment has been undergoing remodeling to a high-density open floor plan. Not sure who this is supposed to appeal to, but it has become much harder to focus on individual work.

Compensation methodology for managerial employees is opaque; management bonuses and raises, while not at all bad in recent years, seem to be drawn from a hat, and it’s hard to know where you stand and what to expect from year to year.

Mon Sep 30 2019, Senior User Experience Designer,"Atlanta, GA",Former Employee ,Contractors keeping secrets and used as pawns in power struggles...,1,"Delta Airlines itself is a great company with great top-level leadership.
","The project I was working on:
There were two divisions within the company that wanted to own the project. Their directors used the contractors as pawns as they tried to wrestle power away from each other.

Down to the Director and slightly below levels of management, there was no direction given. They basically hired a bunch of different contractors from different contracting companies to work on the project. They provided ZERO leadership to tie the groups together. They left it up to the contractors to figure out all problems and resolve everything. Some of us tried. However, if other contractors essentially take the ""You're not the boss of me"" approach and won't listen to reason and refuse to implement processes that benefit everyone, it becomes a near impossible task. UX was creating designs and conducting research, and development implemented their own designs, ignoring UX design and research, and even what some of the key stakeholders and users expressly told them they wanted.

When the project ultimately failed and led to one of the contractors getting scolded, everyone, from every contractor, started to take ""me vs everyone else"" approach to circling the wagons and cya, all while looking for scape goats. And this was just between contractors. It happened within contracting companies where they ate their own in attempts to point finger and say it was him, not me.

""Leadership"" was nowhere to be found. 

The entire environment was incredibly dysfunctional, to the extent that I have never seen before in decades of working in similarly sized companies.
Advice to Management
Stop contracting from so many different companies, and actually do your job and provide leadership between them. Act as a single point of contact, a single source of the truth, resolve disputes, make goals clear, and it would help if you actually understood the roles that people were hired for. You can hire people and pay them a ton of money to write requirements when they have never written a requirement in their life. Understand what a specific job is and does before you just start hiring random people, and if you ever do get the right mix of people, don't use them as pawns against each other in some stupid power struggle for ownership of a project. Learn to do what's best for the company, not what is best for you.

Learn to do what's best for the company, not what is best for you.

It was such a great experience, however, I decided the job wasn't for me. I looked through many reviews on many sites and thought this job would be a good fit for me after much research. But what made me leave wasn't mentioned, since everyone gets paid same salary no matter how well you perform, there really isn't an incentive to go ""above and beyond"" at the job it seems. Yeah, there is skybucks, but there isn't any upward mobility from performing well aside from getting a few bucks. I work hard in my job, and really like to help others, customers or coworker who is working slower. however, this personality made the job stressful/difficult for me without adequate rewards to offset. I decided to look for another opportunity where I would be recognized for being myself rather than to become like everyone else and do the bare minimum. I thought the management was great, and I was treated with so much respect by the ground staff. But the work can be difficult on ur body and mind if you work hard. It was still a great experience, working and conversing with the senior mamas and papas who have been in the industry from the glam days was amazing. I know management is also working on rewarding workers who go the extra mile, but I feel like what we have currently wasn't enough to offset the stress I went through at my job. Maybe just a personal problem, or maybe not since I feel many FAs feel burnt out from the job. Maybe it's just Maybelline

I have been working at Delta Air Lines part-time for more than 8 years
Pros
There aren't many pros for part time Ready Reserve employees. It is sold as flexible hours, great flight benefits, ability to have another job (for insurance & living wage). It is none of these now, though it used to be. If you are aiming for a full time Delta career, then working as a ready reserve will start you down the path to full time. But be aware- it could take YEARS (10 plus, at my station). If you are willing to relocate, it might take less time. Delta is good to their full time employees. They get decent benefits, pay and vacations - time off to enjoy their flight benefits. Unfortunately, much of the full time benefits are paid for by denying a huge part of the workforce any benefits at all.
Cons
Ready reserves, Delta's part time un-benefited workers, are the Cinderella's of Delta. They work more days a year than the full time employees who have all the benefits. They get 1 week of unpaid vacation a year, while full time employees get paid vacations starting at 2 weeks, after 1 year of employment, 3 weeks after 5 years, etc,.... A ready reserve with 15 years of service still only gets 1 week of un- paid vacation. It is almost impossible to use the benefits. Trading shifts is allowed, but it's difficult to cobble enough time to travel very far and stand-by flights are risky. You have to be able to get back in time for work. Planning a family vacation is impossible, because trading is only approved 30 days in advance at most, so you can't pay for a cruise, co-ordinate family members vacations, get a deal on a resort, because you won't know if you will get the time off until 30, or usually less days, before. Full time employees don't have this problem. Their generous paid vacation weeks allow them to plan up to a year in advance. Ready reserves work the same schedule as full time 40 hours a week employees. Their shifts are shorter. But they work 5 days a week, with no flexibility. Ready reserves used work 3 or 4 days a week and have some flexibility, which is why workers stayed with the job. The flexibility made up for the lack of benefits and allowed people to have a second job or time for school or family. Now that is impossible and most quit within the first year. Delta has a very low retention rate for ready reserves, which is a disservice to the customers, because there are constantly high numbers of inexperienced employees training. If you want a part time job and plan to use the flight benefits, go to Southwest or American. You will get some benefits and be be treated more fairly. For those wondering why I am still currently employed at Delta; all airlines are seniority based, for scheduling shift times, etc... I kept hoping things would get better, but the opposite has happened, except for a pay scale change. I have 8 years with Delta and don't want to start all over at the bottom again. Hindsight is always better than foresight.
Advice to Management
Please do something to improve the ready reserve program. Every chance we get, we beg for the flexibility, that we used to have. With record profits, why can't Delta do something for the ready reserves? Give us the same vacation time as the benefited workers, so we can, at least, use our benefits and plan R & R, like the everyone else. With Target, Whole Foods, etc... starting at $15 an hour now, the high stress, working all holidays, constantly lifting heavy bags, airline jobs are not so attractive, especially with no time off. Year in and year out, a grueling 5 days a week, with only one week off per year. How can Delta talk so much about the Rules of the Road, when those rules are only the standard for full time employees, not ready reserves? We are a sub class of workers. Delta has the power and the profit to change that.

","Sadly, pretty much everything. 
Incompetent and disorganized hiring, interview and training processes. Pay is not great, no work/life balance, horrible scheduling, making it near impossible to work other jobs you already had or really have other commitments due to work and/or exhaustion. Given false information on flexibility, schedules, etc. No real benefits, no loyalty, no one really cares about the good people who are going above and beyond as great, efficient workers and the only people to ever compliment employees on a job well done are customers; no one else. But management will definitely be the first to criticize or complain about anything trivial instead of actually doing a good job in any managerial capacity. To them you are not a good employee part of a Delta family, all you are is another body to break while getting overworked in understaffed departments due to high turnaround from many of the above issues. Sadly in all my years of employment this is by far one of the WORST companies I have ever worked for. It's really a shame that they don't care at all and guaranteed many more will be dropping like flies.
Advice to Management
Learn to do your job effectively, run your departments better, learn how to treat employees, give praise when due, treat people as individuals not a corral of sheep, stop giving false info, forcing people to work more than they should, get some flexibility, and get with the time, this is not 1920 after all.

But it’s so freaking easy and repetitive that you can feel yourself getting dumber by the minute. Same issues as any customer service job as far as dealing with passengers. Also it’s not glamorous and you will spent majority of your layovers in an airport hotel with about 12 hours to rest and that’s it. Also it will do weird things to your body and health.

Sun Mar 10 2019, Gate Agent,"Los Angeles, CA",Current Employee ,I mean it’s ok!,10,"Yes you fly for free domestically (ON STANDBY), meet a lot of people. Plenty of opportunities in other states if you are looking to transfer. Benefits can be great if you are full time. (You don’t get any medical if you are ready reserve which is part time)
","Your body will indeed break down if you work on the ramp. There’s no if ands or buts about it. Eventually you will get hurt. You can be as “safe” as you want but lifting heavy bags everyday will break you down. Working as a gate agent you have to be mentally strong to deal will time pressure in conjunction with attending to passengers needs. (And the rude and disrespectful ones will test you) especially if there are cancellations,delays, etc...

Now I must say the biggest CON is that your flight privileges are only amazing when the flight isn’t full. 95% of the time the flights are full. No matter where you are. You are flying on standby which means you get whatever seats are left if any. So you’ll spend ALL day (6am -9pm at times) at the airport trying to catch a 3 hour flight somewhere. It’s kind of a joke...So take that into consideration of all you have to deal with and is it worth it. Because be honest we all want an airline job for the benefits. That’s as honest as I can be hope this helps. 

You will not be able to make a decent leaving off of the pay, Full time is hard to come by, I have a colleague that has been trying to become full time for 10 years!

For the most part I haven’t had any bad experiences with management. Possibly due to my work ethic and time and attendance being perfect. But I have heard that they play favorites and a lot of politics just like everything else.
