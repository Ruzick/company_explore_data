","WestRock runs on who you know and who likes you. Nepotism is rife as is the number of managers who are not capable of working at the level they have been promoted to. Senior management is tone deaf and incredibly short sighted. The CEO says he cares about diversity and about the BLM movement; he doesn't. Just look at the make up of the senior management team. He is a good ole boy inherited by acquisition. 
This is a company that was declared essential in March 2020 by the US government and continued to make a good profit throughout the year and yet, very quietly laid people off at the end of the year to look good on paper to their investors. What a despicable move to contribute to the Nation's unemployment plight when your business has not been affected.

Be more involved in your trainees development by having set expectations on mentors and holding them accountable.

Test your management on what they say they have done in regards to this program, as things may not look as they appear and therefore may be inadequate as mentors for this program.

Mon Dec 30 2019, Multiple,,Former Employee ,"Too Fat, Too Slow, and Too Dumb",11,"Great compensation and 401k plan. Very easy to hide and keep your head down.
","WestRock is the prime example of a company that can't get out of its own way. 

The company is way too FAT with too many levels. I worked at corporate and I worked in the field and I can say I honestly wondered what some people did for 40 hours a week - but those people were always the one impeding change or progress forward. They could make a 30% cut at corporate and never notice those people missing - I am being serious!

WestRock and the industry in general have been slow to move into a digital economy, especially when it comes to going to market. It's tough to make change in a large global company, but middle and upper management resist doing anything different than they did 25 years ago. I was amazed at how stagnant this company is, especially for being a Fortune 200. If you join the company don't expect to be working on the cutting edge of anything. Ask yourself, If I left this job in X number of years what have I learned that I can go do somewhere else? There's a reason people stay in the industry all their life, they don't get applicable skills to do anything else.

Change and forward progress is always welcomed with skepticism, and if you make your boss or senior management feel threatened by your potential - go ahead and pack it up because they only want yes people who agree with their ideas. And trust me, there are plenty of bad ideas to go around here. They're currently trying to change the culture in the company by putting a premium on bringing in more diversity. Why not just hire better people regardless of what they look like?

If you want to meek out a paycheck and a long career never pushing yourself or learning anything new - this is the company to do it at. HR is so terrified of a lawsuit they rarely will fire people, and believe me I've seen some pretty awful behavior at every level of the company that was tolerated.

","poor health plan (obama care light) and no sick days (just use your vacation PTO for sick days - that is just wrong). Old technology platform in IT - needs serious upgrading from a 60's system and also they have pieced together their platform with 8 or 9 different systems that don't talk to each other. Management has run amuck is what I would say. They have no accountability and make the lower rank and file pay for their mistakes. Also difficult to move around in the company to new positions so you are really on your own - always look over your shoulder and be prepared for the inevitable layoff every 2 to 3 years.
Advice to Management
Work on benefits for your employees - example give them 5 sick days in a use it or loose it scenario. Work on your technology platform - for example you have SAP in house but don't use it for even the most basic operations like order management. Instead you use a 50+ year old system that is falling apart and very difficult to navigate through and use. Remember technology doesn't get cheaper year over year so make the investment now so you can communicate across divisions and newly purchased companies to keep everyone in the loop. Right now it's all verbal communication with lots of room for error. I could go on and on but I'll end here - you have some fantastic people in your company, don't do house cleaning every few years and replace them with new hires to keep yourself looking good to the stock market. Those folks will appreciate you a lot more if you invest in the future the right way!

Wed Oct 09 2019, Professional,"Atlanta, GA",Current Employee ,"Acquisition Binge Leads to Layoffs, Anemic Growth and Tense Working Environment",11,"Good 401(k). Decent benefit package. Avoid the company stock plan, though. The stock price isn't going up anytime soon.
","WestRock, used to be a 25,000 person company. It is now a 50,000 person company as a result of a series of acquisitions.
But getting bigger did not make the company more profitable. Instead, it increased corporate debt, brought the scrutiny of government regulators, and left management trying to piece together a confused mess of mills and corporate structures and ex-headquarters and workforces The result -- significant white collar layoffs at the Atlanta Headquarters and in the plants that started October 1, and aren't likely to end anytime soon. 
A company facing this is a bad place to be. People are stressed, worried about the future and face doing much more with less. Layoff decisions are arbitrary and often appear mean-spirited. WestRock’s severance model is 1 week for each year of employment and uses Sub-Pay, a perfectly legal but definitely punitive method, to reduce severance payments. Sub-Pay requires employees to file for unemployment immediately after leaving the company in order to get their severance. Then deducts from the weekly severance the weekly amount of unemployment. This affects everyone – except of course the C-suite.
WestRock’s compensation levels are below industry standard. They won’t increase much (if at all) while you are there. Their corporate structure is flat and stove piped and WestRock corporate doesn’t promote people. The average raise (when one is given) is 1 or 2 percent. HR is focusing on luring millennials to the company. Given these realities, that group won’t be happy or interested, even if there is a ping pong table in the lunchroom.
The current CHRO has been around for a couple of years. She often challenges old ways (sometimes a good thing), but the CHRO approach to people management is defined by this statement made in her opening remarks at the company: “A meeting with me is a learning experience”. That attitude trickles down.

","I have at times witnessed and experienced the typical corporate ""Boys Club"" vibe... There are very few women in Senior leadership positions. 

The Company is siloed, often making cross-divisional and even cross-departmental communication challenging. Frequently there are competing objectives and/or bureaucracy which cripple output and stifle creativity.

Possibly this is limited to my group but the attitudes around flexible working hours/occasional work-from-home seem to be very outdated. You're treated like a freeloader if you want to work from home more than once a month, even though we travel and put in long hours quite a bit.

Advice to Management
The desire to grow and expand often puts more work on current employees, asking more and more while telling them they cannot get much of a raise because we're watching the budget. This hurts morale and causes us to lose good employees. Constantly increasing the job requirements is fine...if you pay people for it. No pay increases are understandable in the short term, until you require even more.

Advice to Management
Stop letting the fact that you’re a Union shop hold back the progress of the plant and, negotiable better work conditions with your employees cause the turnover rate for that plant is ridiculous. Extend the training period for 60-90 days with more hands on training. And if they don’t work out within first couple of weeks then find a good fit instead firing. But from what I here, it all depends on who you are and what you are if you remain with the company. I can read between the lines and I see how upper management is set up.

","Both senior and local management is clueless and is comprised of people without actual management experience. Local management lacks any sort of knowledge of business process management, conflict resolution skills or even common sense. The only skill they seem to possess is blind delegation of problems they should be solving at the top. 

There are 2 types of people at MPS. 
The first group of people are bottom of the barrel. HR brought them in just because they are warm bodies to fill positions at the lowest wage possible. And yes, there are quite a few of these people that hold management and salaried positions. They use the “point system” to keep a constant revolving door of hourly workers so they never have to increase anyone's wages or give promotions. 

The second are the real people in charge. You will know who they are by the bags under their eyes, the 70+ hour work weeks, and the look of complete despair on their faces. These are the people that are filling 2 to 4 positions at one time. If they have not quit already.

A warning!! If you are intelligent, knowledgeable or skilled, expect to be to be driven into the ground. Overworked and underpaid doesn't even come close to describing it. Expect 60+ hour weeks at pay well below market value. Management will pawn off anything they can on you. 

Hourly employees, realize that you will be treated like cattle. You are considered 100% expendable.

","The cons outweigh the pros, no contest. Upper management likes to micromanage the most insignificant issues, yet when we really need them to address critical problems- they're nowhere to be found; they leave you to fend for yourself despite the complete LACK of control that you're given of the situations. Not to mention, there is a lot of ""finger pointing"".

Large communication gaps amongst departments, and misaligning goals. 

Awful culture, not going to change anytime soon. Behind the times by light years. You're not given a voice on decisions that will directly impact your daily job, management is aware of that, yet they are doing nothing but dangling empty promises to your face. They give false hope to keep naive people, those who know better see right through it. 

Lastly, antiquated systems. If you want to be a top contributor in the supply chain world, you cannot cut corners. Learn to invest in world class softwares like other companies. Outdated systems make the job needlessly complex for employees who have to use it everyday. Actually, the whole department specializes in unnecessarily complicated procedures, efficiency is not their forte. Companies with strong supply chains do not NEED have to multiple systems just to keep up with demand.
Advice to Management
When faced with company initiatives that will impact your employee's jobs tremendously, please be sure to communicate messages effectively into all departments and divisions. Don't allow the lowest people on the totem pole, who have no control or had no say over your ""executive"" decisions to relay the messages.
