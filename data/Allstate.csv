Sun Jan 31 2021, Catastrophe Claims Adjuster,,Current Employee ,Good benefits terrible work,0,"Management in the cat team is good. It’s probably one of the more centralized areas of Allstate. Hiring is good and lay offs seem rare because there is always work. The PTO is amazing. Some of the best PTO options, the most days I’ve ever had. The travel perks are great, you get to keep your points. I like the schedule of 10 days on 4 days off. Alternative travel is really nice.
","This is a very high stress environment. Fast paced job. Adjusters are prone to burnout fast. The claims work is endless. It always feels unfinished. They expect 12 hour days at minimum but your often working more, and constantly changing metrics gradually increasing expectations and responsibilities gets old. Every day is a confrontation with a customer or a contractor. It wears on you and burns you out eventually. The pay could be more for what you have to put up with. Allstate makes you fight for your well earned cat pay. Pay is low compared to other companies (base pay and Cat pay) they haven’t raised their cat pay in 15 years to keep with inflation. No differential paid for more expensive areas of deployment. Per diem is low.
Advice to Management
Stop piling working onto do adjusters. They have enough on their plates. Stop with the unrealistic metrics that don’t properly or fairly measure the adjusters performance like the customer service survey, should not be a direct reflection on the adjusters and effect their raise even when the question to the customer doesn’t specifically ask about the adjusters performance. They have pressure from the company and pressures from the contractors and the customers, it’s too much stress. The 12 hour days are too much. They often turn into 15 hour days. It’s unrealistic to think this could be long term. The work becomes consuming.

Advice to Management
Allow LSP's to take time with prospects and new customers to answer all questions and make sure they fully understand what they are covered for and what is not covered

Dwelling policies, before quoting, should be pulled up online to see a picture of the property in order to know if it is a risk worth insuring. If so, get a visual of the home and surroundings to quote PROPERLY and consider balance of homeowner loan when deciding WITH CUSTOMER the fair amount the want the policy to insure.

This takes time and number of dial quotas don't take this into consideration. THIS IS NOT PUTTING the customers best interest first@ :^)

Advice to Management
The layoffs are going to kill the department. Having an third party company come in and review our department to see how many layoffs were needed during our slow time was not the best idea. The metrics are impossible to meet in the current situation of the number of chats. And now taking on a different departments job because they realized that the people they laid off there were actually needed is hysterical. It takes more than a month to review a department for those types of changes knowing that our volume picks up at the start of the year through to about August. I’m not sure that there is a way to fix it now. 3-4 chats at a time all day is too much and you cannot even think clearly. 2 with the occasional 3rd is fine. But you only have so many screens to be able to look at the policies. We have offered sit-a-longs to upper management to see the chaos and actually how difficult it is. Add in the impossible metrics because we are compared to the CCC when our job functions are not even the same. A lot of people are burnt out and are looking to leave. You are going to loose some of your best people and it’s honing to be too late once you realize it.

","Instability - constant changing with no clear direction. If another company is having success they follow but by then its not on trend. They can never come up with anything innovative which really hinders how you do your job. Also each office is doing their own thing there is no consistency at each MCO.
Low Pay - Increase wages for people who actually do the job instead of for executives in home office. 
Slow to Promote for minorities. There are women in leadership on the field level but home office is limited and one minority. 
Benefits are TERRIBLE. High deductible plans that will have you paying your premiums for doctors appointments.

There has been many changes that have come to the company. A lot of them are not for the better at all. Here's one example, We used to have a Agency Support line that we would call in for any questions regarding customer's policies, billing issues, underwriting, etc. They have now gone to chat in only. It takes HOURS to get someone on the chat to speak with you and they are now very rude and are attending 3 other people while they are attending you. One of my coworkers waited over 4 hours to talk to someone for some help on a policy. Another example is that they had the nerve to tell Agents some of them being agents for over 40 years that moving forward that when someone calls the 1800 allstate number for a quote their reps are going to have a more competitive Auto product than if someone were to call in to an agency. It's almost like the company is slowly trying to get rid of Agencies as a whole. These are just 2 of the many changes the company is implementing.

Mon Jan 11 2021, Financial Analyst,,Former Employee ,Fallout of 2020,0,"Advocacy for work-life balance:

Leaders and managers for the most part seem pretty understanding and encourage team members to voice their needs, whether it is spending time with the children or family at home, taking frequent breaks, or having shorter meetings... At least in theory. These are all ideas that were so frequently repeated and discussed in meetings with management that you hope, if not for you, it happens for someone, somewhere.
","Confusing corporate terminology:

At the onset of the pandemic the company's executive officers pledged a steadfast commitment to ""Transformative Growth."" This makes sense because by definition, if something grows, it also transforms. The phrase is grammatically sound. Some mistakenly believed it meant company performance would grow faster than the number of COVID cases. During a Town Hall meeting in early spring we were told Transformative Growth meant that there would be a 0% reduction in the work force. However, three months later management said that, due to Transformative Growth, the company would see an 8% reduction in workforce. It was unsettling and many troubled employees started working late, often past 8:00pm or 9:00pm local time, performing due diligence and internet searches for all possible definitions of ""Transformative Growth."" It later turned out that the phrase was just a colloquialism for ""shareholder profit."" After this realization, things settled down and 92% of the original work force went about their day.

","Agency models vary by location, but in general the systems and support that Allstate New Jersey provides to its local agents is horrendous. The company recently gutted its support team, laying off a ton of underwriters and other support workers that the agencies relied on. They are migrating all underwriting and tech support to online chat systems, so you can't even call in anymore for help. Allstate recently introduced a new quoting platform which looks nice, but is so riddled with bugs that I can't give a reliable price to a customer, and have been embarrassed on several occasions when the price inexplicably changes. It seems like Allstate New Jersey is providing it's agencies with the bare minimum to survive.

Mon Nov 16 2020, Customer Service Representative,,Former Employee ,Strict Metric Based Call Center,0,"Working from home. Friendly team members.
","This is about the Customer Care Center - Allstate Benefits/American Heritage Life Insurance division of Allstate. The leadership in that department is disorganized and sloppy. Everything that seems to go wrong from mistakes to the faulty systems and everything in between falls on the reps but the leaders take no accountability. The resource navigation systems are also disorganized and sloppy making it hard to locate accurate research details while assisting the customers on a call. The customer care center is severely understaffed, and they always say they will hire more people to balance the work flow but they just hire temps and dismiss them shortly after. Hire more permanent reps. The calls are back to back all year with more upset customers than positive because they make it really hard for the customers to access information from the policies they are investing in, limiting consumer awareness of their full benefits which is shady and causes the customers to lash out their frustration onto the reps. Majority of the customers in this department are elderly and they are not tech savvy which requires more time and patience while assisting them but yet the metrics are rigid and tight. The Allstate Benefits website functions poorly and we are always promised updates which always takes forever. It’s 2020 and customers still cannot pay online, update their bank info or file claims directly to the website without paper forms. There is no mobile app for this division either which would help customers gain information and make updates easily to their coverage. Be prepared for the leadership to be nonexistent when you actually need effective leadership, but to magically appear to nitpick at every metric if you miss the mark by a point or three. The attendance policy is very strict in comparison to the actual time off availability and there is no schedule flexibility(swaps, flex time, etc) which creates a poor work life balance. If you work evenings, there is no shift differential pay like other call centers. You may have to wait months for your PTO to gain approval due to lack of staff in the customer care center. The call monitoring reviews are strict with demands for excellence but management has yet to provide any example of what a great call actually sounds like so most reps just do their best. Your “best” will never be enough. They just listen and criticize without demonstrating what improvement actually appears like. The work load is also unevenly distributed. If you are placed in one department within the customer care center, be prepared to do the work of every single department. Even though you will not be hired as a claim examiner, you will be docked points for not examining claims during customer claim status inquiries which is unfair. You will also have to play the role of a billing expert also even though your system has limited access to billing info( and that department does not accept transferred calls for the customer to receive the most accurate info). If you work evenings your needs and flexibility requests are pretty much non existent to the department and if you work until closing you must stay logged in until ALL of the calls in the queue are cleared which is unpredictable depending on the day and can cost you more time over the end of your shift. All in all, the environment feels very strict and dehumanizing because of the strict metrics, poor work life balance and high demand that the leaders can barely demonstrate by example. You cannot be a minute out of place without being micromanaged and questioned about your every move while leadership goes missing for hours at a time into so called “meetings”. Yes, It’s the typical dreadful call center vibe that you’ve been warned about. If you decide to work here and get hired, enter with a plan to move up in the company as quickly as you can into other departments because the call center will get tiring quick.
Advice to Management
Engage with your reps more outside of just metric talk. Please refrain from condescending tones in your emails and communications because the reps work very hard everyday even if your metrics do not turn out “perfect”. Appreciation and positive reinforcement will go along way. Quality work takes time. Update your computer systems. They are very outdated in these modern times. Provide customers more options to make payments and create a user friendly app for customer benefit management... the implementation of modern technology across your systems will definitely make a great positive impact and will make the calls less stressful between both the caller and the representative. Add a night differential pay bonus. The occurrence portion of the attendance policy is outdated and ineffective, 365 days for an occurrence is way too long. Life happens and great employees should not be penalized for an entire year because of that.

Wed Oct 28 2020, Licensed Insurance Agent,,Former Employee ,Watts Agency Allstate in Birmingham AL,0,"Great Training. They are very enthusiastic about their lies of the money you'll make. They say that have a competitive pay scale, but leave out the parts where you don't get paid. They are great about showing you sales process.
","Lied about pay scale (said you will make 6-12% of what you sell, but neglected you had to make a certain amount of items before they even pay you. The 6% doesn't even happen until you scale up 3 times. I didn't learn this until AFTER my first paycheck and I had questions. They tell you that you'll have financial freedom and will make $60,000 in your first year, but then find ways not to pay your commission. 

I was top salesman for several months and still didn't get a check more than $4000.

Real good about throwing people under the bus as to why they weren't successful. 

They tell you that they are ""family first"" but in the event of a family/medical emergency they ask you why you aren't producing. 

They farm their new hires friends/families and then they dump people. 

Dangle ""agent"" as your title and dangle the carrot of ""your own agency"" but no one has ever done it with them.

Tell you they'd never require you to sell life insurance, then the very next month require you to sell a certain amount or you'll be terminated.

They have a ""toilet bowl contest"", whereas if you're the lowest grossing agent for that week, you're required to clean the whole office. This is during a pandemic. And they're getting free janitorial services out of you. Cleaning up after people's lunches and coffees and workstations. DURING A PANDEMIC.
This is AFTER the agency owner caught COVID. 

They say that they would spend $100k a month to find that perfect lead or method to make all their agents successful and reach their goals, then complain about spending less than $4k on leads/advertising. 

I almost never made more than $2000/mo. And in my time there I brought in $179,460 in premium for the year!!

Great way to help everyday America and families protect themselves from losses.
","From my experience a toxic culture of fear, bullying, and intimidation are fully embraced. The bottom line and results are far more important than protecting clients with insurance and supporting employees well being. My first two years were not like this but from 2016-2020 it was a dumpster fire. 

In many meetings, Sales Leaders were being bullied/harassed for not hitting numbers. At the same time, the company was changing goals and raising rates. 
 Without getting into too many details, we were even being asked to bully/intimidate agency owners and harass them for not hitting goals like we were being made to feel. It was not a good environment for sustainability and winning. 

 As another example, during the Covid19 Pandemic all employees were forced to take assessments to determine who would be laid off. This was a 6 month process and the expectations and communications were always unclear. Over Townhalls the Senior Management was very insensitive to employees and the CEO/President of Personal lines would talk about how the Transformative growth will actually help so many of us. They played music like celebrate good times and another brick in the wall as they knew they would be firing 6,000 people during a pandemic. Many of these people will struggle to find new work. The work environment and culture was so toxic. I saw a lot of depression and people leaving on FMLA over my 5 years at the company. I also saw many agencies fail and many agents terminated.

Allstate even bought another company during the layoffs called National General. 

I am so grateful I am now at a new organization that does the right thing for employees and customers and that I was able to find something new. 

Allstate leaves people broke and scarred. If you are considering them as a client or employee or agency I would think twice. However I know many of my colleagues will struggle to find something new especially if they are older. There is life after Allstate and out of all these cons the greatest blessing was leaving and starting something new.
Advice to Management
Thomas Wilson and Glen Shapiro need to resign at the end of this year. They are very out of touch with their customers/agents/and employees. These moves should have been done years ago of cutting Middle Management. I definitely agree the system needed to change however cutting all these jobs while buying new companies is not the way to behave. They are way too late to the party. The cuts were definitely necessary however they should have happened years ago!!!

This once great Blue Chip Company and Fortune 100 company will continue to slide under their leadership.

This once great Blue Chip Company and Fortune 100 company will continue to slide under their leadership.

- Your Pros employment-wise will depend on your boss. B/c Of this, I have good benefits, like medical insurance, sales + commission, paid time off accrued overtime, AllState-recognized holidays off.
","- Since every office is run by an individual agent, you could end up with a crummy boss and coworkers too, where everything is unorganized, you don't get commission payments unless you meet a certain sales count, you don't get the days you request off, you are given too much work load with no help to ask from, etc. 
So just choose your agent wisely and know your worth, and make yourself clear on what you want out of your employment and what you can bring to the table.

They announced this past June that they would be going from 14 regions down to 4. Most if not all jobs being outsourced to India. After this announcement they announced they purchased National General for about 4 billion. They do not care about employees or their mental health. The only thing that matters is the shareholders and how rich they can become. Oh and apparently we as people of color are considered “the blacks” when Tom Wilson spoke on the recent racial tensions. I could go on but nothing will change, they will continue their racist, communist behavior and continue to become rich off the backs of these hard working individuals that they have no value for whatsoever.

The concept of the company is wrong, they are doing another tired and failed car sharing platform. First phase of their company should be renting out cars via allstate agents to people who have claims. Per CEO it failed due to internal political reasons

Instead they are renting out spaces at airports and have often just a few vehicles per location; 9 locations in the US, seems impossible to rent vehicles at 4 of those: DAL, IAH, PHL, MIA.

To show how incompetent management is, they rolled out a product called ""AvailX"" without even doing a google search to see if there were other products by that name (""Avail-X Natural Male Enhancement & Testosterone Booster""). They choose AvailX to copy off of UberX (according to product manager) to play off their name.

Completely restructure your business model, gives your employees the proper training, set a standard for ALL departments, and find a way to actually care about your students beyond just get them in sign up for class.

","Corrupt culture. Agents that lie to customers are rewarded so long as they're growing. Throw your morals at the door if you choose to work here. Allstate has no problem denying claims, stealing from agents and firing good employees (so long as it boosts the share price). Upper management has only 1 goal... improve the stock price regardless of the cost. In my 24 years of experience, I have never been so disturbed by a company's ""bottom line"" attitude. Take a look at insider selling vs insider buying. All the execs are selling because nobody has any faith in the company. Allstate's profitability is industry leading and yet they still continue jacking up rates for great, long term customers in order to acquire crappy esurance customers... why? I forgot to mention that Allstate will change the sales requirements and goals annually without even considering the market outlook. (My agency has won awards annually for 9 straight years!) 

PS - they're laying off 2000+ employees over the next year.

Advice to Management
I worked very hard, averaging 12 hours a day for your company over the last 9 1/2 years. A customer with obvious mental illness happened to name me in a complaint and since she sent the same complaint three times, even after the complaint was resolved, a mid-level manager decided that if I was removed, the customer would stop clamoring for an additional $30K above the cost to repair her home, because she wanted the repair contractor to add on an outdoor kitchen at Allstate's expenses. I told her as kindly as possible that the policy pays for damage, not for upgrades to her lifestyle. I was not given the opportunity to explain the situation to the manager, because she was eight layers up, and couldn't be bothered with actually checking the facts. The customer had said she would work her way up the company phone list until she got someone to pay her the imagined money she was requesting. To shut her up, the manager threw me out the door. She wasn't even aware that I was the lead adjuster working on six lawsuits for the company and that she would through everybody into a mess. One of the lawsuits, I had negotiated with the public adjuster and other parties and was in the process of issuing checks, when I was booted out. It made me sick that a total of 30 customers, with whom I had been working, suddenly had to have new adjusters take over the claims, not knowing what was behind some of them (some were marked sensitive), and not caring. I still don't know how firing me settled the customer's unmerited demand for money beyond her repair costs but the poor adjuster who had to pick up the ball was tormented with 4 hours of the customer holding her hostage over the phone. What a mess. Mindless reaction to getting a phone call and not knowing what to do with it. Shame.

I witnessed a scam at the Lemont Illinois location. They stopped hiring and the adjusted the call flows to states primarily where it was impossible to sell along with an implemented minimum sales requirement. 

So, all these fantastic agents who were top sellers withing months were being walked out the door. Then, management would lie about their terminations (said I was terminated for misconduct, lol) to the unemployment board. Before you know the building was at 30% capacity. 

Once at 30% they announced closing the place after hundreds of unwarranted firings to avoid paying severance and other dues.

If you want to stay ahead of disruption and safeguard against 'outside the box' industry players, then bring those perspectives to the table. Decision making takes entirely too long because of the tall/narrow organizational structure in many departments.

","Management ; Continuous improvement ; Pay ; Lack of knowledge from the Agents ; Recently switched to a new ""round robin"" metric system which was a waste of everyone's time and didn't solve the problem it looked to resolve. Rather created more stressors on the front line employees.
Advice to Management
Management isn't needed other than the tier 2 or 3 huddles or yearly reviews & time keeping, which seldom brings changes to the department. Continuous improvement is a joke, is often changed by management but they don't perform the duties we do on a daily basis. The department needs to refocus on the employees actually doing the work rather than keeping everything ""high level"" for management which only looks at the numbers, and never asks the questions to resolve any issues, or why the issues are arising in the first place. Also needs to re-do the whole audit system, employees should not be deducted points which interfere with the yearly raise over items that are not customer/agent impacting.

","Allstate is moving toward going online and phasing local agents out of a job. Customer service is average at best. Claims are also average at best. Underwriting support is usually subpar. Guidelines and restrictions make writing new business difficult, and time is wasted spent tracking down useless paperwork for existing customers. The current quoting system is clunky and outdated. The new quoting system is full of kinks. Tech support is overseas and overwhelmed and usually takes a day or more to resolve more complicated issues. There are constantly software issues. Agents can no longer bind same-day policies.
Advice to Management
Give your agents back same-day binding authority. Your system allows agents to issue a same-day policy and even prints out an ID card with that date, but the policy downloads with the following days’ date. Underwriters give mixed answers, ranging from “we should know” to “there was a memo” (there wasn’t) to “it’s a system error that is being fixed.” That is a huge E&O red flag.

","Run, run far. Allstate, at least in Atlanta is not the place to work. I have never in my life seen anything as scary as working for Allstate. They have literally brainwashed employees into thinking it is ok to take on more responsibility for no additional pay. They like to try before you buy, for at least 3-6 months, prior to discussing your pay. SMH. Also, they are asking wayyyyy too much from you for the little pay they give out any way. They make you salaried so that you can log in on weekends, evenings, you name it. Not to mention, they will book your schedule up with pointless meetings and then drop a bunch of claims on your desk so that you have to work out after hours just to keep up. Allstate pushes nothing but lies to get you in the door, it’s a different story when you get inside. There is no 37 hour work week, no flexible schedule, no working from home at least not at this location. Do not be fooled about the work from home, yes for COVID 19 we were, but in one of the pointless meetings we had we were advised that we will be going back to office.

Advice to Management
Stop with all the daily meetings, how can I work when I’m in meetings all day? Stop continuing to make a simple claims process harder. Matter of fact, is should be a requirement that managers/ CSL’s should have to still handle at least 50 claims a month so that they can stay abreast of the current claims handling process and know what it takes before asking additional work from us.

","They claim to be customer-focused, but as with most corporations they are really focused on the numbers: production and saving the almighty dollar by whatever means necessary. Depending on your manager (I had 9 different managers in 5 years...), the team/office morale can drastically vary. When the business model shifted from field to virtual adjusting in 2017, hundreds of adjusters/managers/quality assurance employees were laid off without notice. The majority of the adjusters that were let go had 20+ years of experience, because their salaries cost the company more than the less tenured adjusters. Flash forward to 2019, and the turnover rate at their Digital Operating Centers (or DOCs) were so high that they are constantly hiring and had to start begging for the laid off adjusters to come back...

Advice to Management
You need to fix your sales areas' especially in the Northeast. I have never worked in a more unethical, misogynistic, bullish environment in the entirety of career (10+ years). I voiced my concerns over and over again and they fell on deaf ears. The one leader I had that cared at all and tried to make a difference on the team and for her direct reports got pushed out and is now in a different area. I was asked multiple times to do things that were not above board (which I did not do, my integrity was not ever for sale) and when I voiced concern to the higher ups I was basically told it was ""so sweet that I had such passion"" and then it was covered up or glossed over. I now work for a competitor and being in this new environment makes it all the more clear how incredibly toxic the Allstate environment was. I can also say, as I have kept in touch with some of my co-workers, it only got worse after I left.

","OVERLY BUSY!! Unhealthy busy!! Some people use up their PTO just to get a break from that place. Very overwhelming position especially for someone who is new to claims. It is not impossible to be on top of your work but it is definitely a challenge. If you miss ONE day you feel like your whole desk is unorganized and unbalanced. Definitely lost a lot of people due to the amount of work load they provide. Also NO BONUSES EVER!! People were OKAY, I can tell that everyone was nice in your face then talked behind your back. I recommend to keep to yourself if hired for this position.

Be involved with your employees! Take the time to sit with them and assist making them the best adjuster as possible! If you see someone is struggling HELP THEM before it's too late to correct their actions. Management was not understanding of the amount of workload and should have been.
