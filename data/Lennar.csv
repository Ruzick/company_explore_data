Pros
Lennar is the best company I have ever worked for. They make their employees a top priority. Through COVID their number one concern has been the health and safety of their employees, trade partners and customers. We have been working by appointment only with locked doors since the early stages of the pandemic and we are crushing our sales numbers. I have not had a single situation in my employment when I didn't feel that the employees were not being considered. Don't get me wrong Lennar expects excellence, and that is okay because you want to do your best work for a company that values you. I can tell you that is extremely rare in this industry. So if you are committed to excellence in your profession and appreciate being valued for that Lennar is a great place to work.

If you’re a salesperson of color, you’ll be placed in only the most difficult to sell communities. After you work to make them successful, you’ll be either moved to another low performing community or given a sales partner. Must endure numerous racist comments about buyers and bullying from toxic white employees simply because they have friends in management. If you question anything, you’ll be targeted for harassment by management or firing. Or they transfer you to the worst performing community to force you to quit.

","Bizarre culture of reciting Red Hen poem by memory, chanting their fight song, wearing Disneyland style name tags and various other cult like traditions to prove alliance to the company. 

Upper executives focused solely on bottom line (bonus) at everyone’s expense if necessary. Not a good place for work-life balance.

Terrible medical benefits, you really need to understand them and factor that into your salary, especially if you have a family.

Executives believe they’re the smartest guys in the room, and are sure to let you know it. Meanwhile the only true measure, stock price, underperforms all of their competitors. But they don’t connect the dots. 

They offer no competitive advantage despite their beliefs. Everything they do can be easily copied & in many cases competition has not only copied but improved their product.

Executive roles are dominated by Caucasian male accountants. While it’s true you don’t need to be a pilot to run an airline, Homebuilding is such a complex and relationship oriented business, when run by a group with no diversity in background it’s easy to see why their stock underperforms competition and why they care less about the soft side of business and more about counting the beans.

You really need to drink the coolaid to survive. Some have and have done well but you need to be of a certain breed.

Upper management should stop focusing on short term bonus & focus on long term strength.

Pros
Has strong brand recognition nationally. Enjoyed my coworkers
Cons
Constant management turnover led to a bit of a circus in terms of direction. The overall culture internally from construction to sales to customer service was quite unhappy. Sales can naturally be a demanding job understandably, but my division did not value work/life balance. It was a churn and burn environment for employees. Lacked integrity for holding home values etc - come Sunday night (end of the week to report sales) if we needed a sale, it was not uncommon to still be at the office at 10pm getting calls from management asking who we could call to beg for a sale - i.e....to run a check over & complete through Docusign by midnight. Unreal & highly unprofessional. Prices would be slashed to get sales by end of Sunday and quite frankly led to appraisal issues, unhappy former clients who would naturally find out eventually and on & on..... ultimately, after a few years, I could not be proud of who I worked for and resigned. Have heard better circumstances from other divisions, but mine was a circus.

I would never recommend Lennar After my experience with them in Colorado. I was a CalAtlantic Sales Consultant prior to the merger with Lennar, then transitioned to a Lennar New home consultant. I have sold homes in Colorado for 18 years and understand you need to tailor each sales contract presentation in a way the suits the customer. I was essentially terminated for for doing my Job. I was written up twice for selling homes, just not the robotic way they prefer. Good Sales people will sell homes in several creative ways in order to get the sale. My Manager didn't like my outside the box ideas. Selling like a Ken barbie Doll(DR) Doesn't win sales. It actually makes you lose several sales because you aren't relatable and empathetic. Your Just Fake!

","You are forced to fly to California to basically fill out your I9 and do some pretty basic surface level training. Its a waste of time, resources, and its disruptive. After you get back you will quickly find everything in the PDX market is not at all the same as what you were told in California. 
 My training consisted of driving around in circles with other customer care reps who complained the entire time about how there was no direction for the care reps. The director who hired me quit 6 months after I started and replaced with someone who did things the polar opposite.
 I was at one point forced to go to a ""team meeting"" at top golf where everyone was drinking in excess while on the clock. There was no regard to employees who may have a substance issue. No inclusivity. I was told I had to be there. This was after I was explicitly told there was no drinking in company time. It was a horrible nightmare. Lets get to the actual homes. 
 Homes are rushed. Construction either doesnt care or just wants to be paid. Homes routinely have massive defect (Missing conduit boxes, inferior drainage, poor quality materials, doors that dont even shut). Its all explained away by saying oh its ""production housing"" and or throwing trades under the bus and forcing customer care to somehow smooth over the issue. Work load become unbearable almost over night. It was not worth it. I quit over night.

Be prepared for a constant barrage of text messages and emails daily. Even more so when sales are soft. 6-7 day work weeks are not uncommon and not optional. 

Product while nice is not being produced fast enough yet sales teams are required to sell homes that don’t exist.

Pros
Staff and management welcome you with open arms. You feel like you are part of the family with the annoying big brother Joe. Management does care as well as most of the other New Home Consultants. They provide a training program for the new hires and provide 8 pay periods of a forgivable draw. Insurance and 401K bennys are great. They let you do events monthly to help bring in traffic.
Cons
Training program is too long
No draw after the forgivable draw runs out
You might be put in a slow community with a too many people
Hard to get events scheduled in your community. 
If you don't have approx 3-6 months of money saved this might not be the career for you.
Advice to Management
Focus more on the slower communities.

Sat Sep 29 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,All depends on division management and division processes,4,"First off I was to start by saying I was with Lennar for more than a year prior to the cal Atlantic acquisition. It was decided at that time that the entire previous management team needed to change. The Lennar division president and all of the Lennar directors we're let go and replaced by the cal Atlantic management team at my division. In order to give you a proper review I will split my review up into old and new management team.

Old management team:
Only pros 
They were genuinely good hardworking people doing the best they knew how to do but we're up against unreasonable expectations and goals. 
Created an atomosphere of critical thinking and self sufficient lower level employees due to lack of management communication or assistance.

New management pros
Sets reasonable and attainable goals
Communicates the progress/status of those goals regularly from top down.
Departmental hand offs are clear and complete. 
Cross-departmental communication is clear and frequent thru daily Huddle's.
Has created an environment where everyone in the division knows what is currently going on and what is upcoming so everyone can plan/focus accordingly.
Has hired and or retained qualified employees in all departments.
Has created an environment where I love going to work everyday and working along great people.
Quarterly celebrations where individuals are recognized for they're efforts.
Everything listed above has created a great work life balance and team atmosphere to go to everyday.
Pay is good 
Benefits are adequate but you have choices
Quarterly and annual bonuses
","Old management cons:
Terrible communication between departments.
Unreasonable goals set every year in order to impress regional management resulting in bad land deals trying to make up for unrealistic goals.
Cumbersome plan and option offering.
Didn't allign with lennar's business model of ""everything's included"" resulting in complicated option and plan offering as well as inefficient processes.
Product specifications inconsistent and changes rarely communicated throughout division.
Understaffed in all departments.
Work-life balance was non existent.
Lots of employee turnover.
Atomosphere very negative.
Lots of burned out employees.
Sense of hopelessness that things were ever going to get better.

New management team cons:
At times there can still be a feeling Cal-Atlantic vs Lennar when it comes to deciding on processes and standard operating procedures. Openmindness is getting better and better as things have progressed.
Advice to Management
Advice for new division management:
Keep doing what your doing. 

Advice for regional management:
Recognize when a division managment team is out of touch with reality and is feeding you unrealistic unattainable forecasting. 
Dig deeper on land deals that are being presented to make up for the unrealistic forecasted numbers. 
Recognize if a division is not operating on an ""everything's included"" model they are not really Lennar. ""Everything's included"" should be a non-negotiable no matter how much option revenue the division president reports at the end of the year.

Thu Sep 13 2018,Anonymous,"Miami, FL",Former Employee ,Like High School with Spreadsheets and Cake,17,"If you like this kind of life, it's a standard 9-6 culture reminiscent of the late 80s, one step short of punch clocks. Easily collect a mediocre paycheck by staring off into space or at your monitor-- most people will have no idea what you're doing. Massive infusion of cake, on a near daily basis… plus catered lunch scraps for you mid-afternoon carb scavengers. Free coffee. No nightmare administrative review process for ""standard"" increases. Nice walk around the campus. Their core business, if you care (I didn't) seems to be relatively strong.
","I'm going to start by saying that I'm not a fan of corporate culture in general, however, Lennar Corporation takes a special spot in my opinion. The IT department (which I was in) is loaded with people who either do a lot of needless work, perform convoluted/outdated workflows, or don't work at all. Mostly the last one. But when ""work"" is actually done it can be defined as spending 2-4 hours writing long-winded passive aggressive emails with your bosses bosses mother in the CC line, undoubtedly combined with that personal sense of corporate ""gotcha"" satisfaction after they click Send. Then they go to lunch.

The CIO tries, but she isn't really well liked (except maybe by the friends she stacked in upper management). It's not her fault that most of the suits are hoodwinked by these pseudo-sophistication trends where being day to day Apple hipsters somehow automatically transform you ""an internet company"". This translates to her engaging with her underlings in a flurry of PowerPoints and buzz word jargon where the end result is a magical techno-utopia that you're all working towards. I consider myself above average in tech, but listening to this is sort of like watching a Star Trek engineering scene where the warp reactor is about to go critical. 

As a department, IT is in about 200 different directions, none of which produce things of value. The over-investment of time into relatively mundane ventures, like getting ticketing systems to work or choosing ""replacement"" tools, makes this place a virtual museum of non-accomplishment and a case study in how throwing money and bodies at random projects is a good way to look busy but actually do nothing. Speaking of things with no value, Tuesdays are ITIL refresher day. We all looked forward to that one.

Success here is generally defined as showing up to the pointless 2am conference calls with 30 or more insomniacs or weekend warriors, because something ""really important"" is happening. Most of this showboating could be accomplished with 30 lines of script code monitoring and notifying the appropriate parties, instead of a mass disruption of circadian rhythms.

If you have anything remotely resembling talent, it's completely wasted at this company. Lacking talent though, this may be the job for you! If you can deal with the petty tweenager like drama that ensues on a near daily basis, you won't have to do any real work and if anyone asks, just tell them you're REALLY busy with whatever tech trend you saw on Twitter this morning.

Tue Nov 28 2017,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Toxic Lies and Let Downs -Long Reading-,14,"The pay is the only thing keeping me here.

I used to love coming to work every day and now it’s like I get slapped in the face with nonsense and have fingers pointed every which way. Bonuses aren’t even great anymore because they aren’t realistic.
","I truly don’t mean to complain as I don’t know EVERYTHING about Lennar but what I’ve experienced is what I’m sharing- a lot of ranting-

1. Management- liars. Don’t belong in a management position. You get blamed for others actions when you volunteer to help other communities by management. They put you down and make you feel like you’re not good enough for your position. 

2. This Division - Everyone in the corporate office sees nothing but potential in everyone IN THE OFFICE. Everyone in the field gets treated negatively and we get worked and worked until we can’t take it anymore or are exhausted. In the last year, there has been more than 5 people who have either quit or have gotten let go. Corporate tries to act like we’re one big happy family and work as teams altogether. The associates in the office could care less about the associates in the field. Office associates schedule and work through their own time and calendar and not think about what the field associates have going on. They over book us. 

3. Culture - COMPLETELY broken. They praised the culture when I went to train in California and got back to a messy environment that doesn’t operate the way California says we should. 

In all honesty, if I was to think about reading reviews before working here, I wouldn’t be working for such a toxic company. They are lucky if I stay here another year. I’m beyond done with being disrespected by management and being yelled at for things that are out of my control. One person can not control a million things at once. I really don’t feel like they even care about me as a person or associate. It really feels like they just have me here to clean up other associates mess’. Can you imagine being hired on just to clean up after people who screw over a community?! It sucks and that’s what it seems like I’m here for. “That’s just one more person who we will run to the ground and clean up after the crappy associate from before” is what I would imagine is happening in their mind. - not literally- 
I wish I would have read into Lennar before i worked here and I think future employees should too.
Advice to Management
Listen to your associates. Stop being disrespectful.

STOP TREATING EVERYONE LIKE A NUMBER. We are people! Not numbers. 

Office associates need to listen to the field associates as we are TIRED of being overbooked by the office not using common sense and looking at a calendar. 

Pay attention to our demeanor. I’m fairly certain mine isn’t very pleasant as I’m always pissed off. You lose amazing associates by the way you treat them and are about to lose another.

","Upper management is incompetent, divisive, purposefully keeps employees in a state of paranoia, and constantly promises executives things that they know cannot be delivered. They expect employees to never make a mistake, to seek approval for everything down to getting permission to send an email to certain people, and have no tolerance for educated opinions if those opinions differ from their own. There is so much red tape, it takes months and months to complete very simple projects. The teams fight against each other and blame everything on other teams - no accountability, and upper management refuses to acknowledge the abusive nature of the environment.

I have been working at Lennar full-time for more than a year
Pros
I cannot rave enough about this place! Every single person I work with on a daily basis is so wonderful & eager to help! People work hard not only because we need our jobs, but because we want to do well for our company & our bosses. Not a day goes by that we don't laugh and have a little fun as we work. 

My direct boss is the most selfless leader I've ever had the privilege of working for. I wish I could be more like her. She is an incredible asset to everyone in our company regardless of what department they are in. She is always willing to stop what she is working on to help all employees with countless questions ranging from ""My key doesn't work, can you come let me in?"" to ""Can you show me how to get to ______ screen in JDE"" to ""Do you have a tape measure?"" to ""I can't figure out why _____ isn't balancing correctly."" I was sick & in the hospital for a week shortly after I started working for Lennar & I was so worried they would be frustrated because I hadn't worked there very long and was already out for seven days. My boss got up extra early, and came by my hospital room at 6:00am to pick up some work that I had taken home to work on before I got sick, and had it all done for me when I came back! The whole team pulled together and did all of my stuff. I wasn't behind at all & she even had a glad you're feeling better card on my desk when I came back This woman does it all!

People are nice to each other in the office & we get along. There are certain times throughout our year that are crazy chaotic as with any other home builder, but we get it done! I mean this from the bottom of my heart- I have been an employee here for almost three years, there has not been one single day...not even one, that I have dreaded going to my job...not even on a Monday!!

The Division President is a hard worker & is very good at his job. He also takes the time to poke fun & give us a hard time. He is far from one of the stuffy suit and tie bosses that only sits in his office and barks out orders via email. He also lets us know that he appreciates us and the things we accomplish.

The VP of Construction is a great guy & an extremely hard worker. I've worked with him before at another company & he's really amazing at what he does!

Lennar has so many employees that have been with the company for more than 20 years and that says it all! We all value our jobs very much. I am proud to be a member of this great team!

Build a great product and everything's included is a great idea. Pay for top performers is unbelievable. Really good benefits and the company culture is performance and customer service focused. Good support from construction managers and customer service reps. The mission is clearly defined by management and the road map is simple but still quite challenging when you are in a community that has slow traffic.
Cons
Although there is a 1 week structured sales training but beyond that the training system was up to tenured employees to show the new employees the ropes. The problem is that the tenured employees view new employees as competition and are not really motivated to help all that much. Recently they have started using regional sales coaches which is a plus but for me its a little too late.

Thu Apr 30 2015,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Dysfunctional Company Going Nowhere Fast,2,"Part of large publicly traded homebuilder, Lennar, with significant brand recognition that may or may not be an advantage in commercial real estate. The company is fairly entrepreneurial for its size even though it is plagued by all the bureaucracy that comes with any large organization.
","Lennar Commercial (LC) is the commercial real estate division of Lennar Homes. LC lacks any strategic direction whereby all the failings to develop leadership, organization, strategy, resources, and capability are placed squarely on the employee to overcome, no matter what the circumstances or how ridiculous the objective is.

Without any strategic vision or coherent organization, Lennar Commercial is a directionless, frenetic place reflecting the personalities of the leadership. Without a mission, shared values, or common goals to guide the team, the leadership is dictatorial, mercurial, impatient, and capricious.

Despite what could be overwhelming financial, brand, and synergistic resources provided by the parent company, Lennar Commercial lacks any strategy or vision to deploy such resources in any effective way or to position itself in a manner that would differentiate itself from its competitors.
Advice to Management
Not having a plan, isn't a plan.

Slow down. Think. Develop a plan. Be about something. Communicate what ""something"" is. Value your people. Collaborate with them. They may even want to contribute if you allow it. Build resources and capability so you can execute efficiently. Align Lennar's overwhelming resources with the team, the mission, and the markets. Real estate development takes time. You will be successful, someday. Maybe.

Pros
Lots of freedom to promote and sell the community you have been assigned to. If in a good location, you can make a lot of money.
Cons
Have to work both Saturday and Sunday. High demanding job due to amount of responsibilites. Management was not always clear on expectations.

Pros
The pros, hmmm in this market there are none unless you like abuse. This division is almost gone there are no new communities opening up.
Cons
Difficult place to work, you can only make decent money if you work 7 days a week. If your not willing to drop everything and work nonstop this is not the place for you. Besides the money is horrible, bartenders make more money and work less hours.

Thu Oct 23 2008,N/A,"Aliso Viejo, CA","Vice President Operations  in Aliso Viejo, CA",Chaos is their middle name,3,"Lennar promotes people respecting others. It employs nice people and they are fun, personable people to work with. Most are quite competent at what they do. The facilities are very good and up to date. The work is quite flexible as most positions evolve into what interests the individual most. Lennnar is quite good about providing training and has an extensive online training system that is open to all. They tend to promote from within and completion of the training programs allows those on the lower ends to seek higher levels. Job openings are posted on internal site that is open to all.
","It is the most undisciplined and disorganized organization I've seen. They have good people running amouck. I was once complimented by a consultant for being the first Lennar person they had seen start a meeting on time. They really lack structure to the point it is like a football team without a playbook, often times having two tailbacks and no body blocking. Their admiration for the unconventional goes beyond good sense allowing the BS'ers and fence sitters to advance and hold positions they clearly have no business having. This creates a drag on the teams making it difficult to achieve team goals.

The senior management never held back from giving me the necessary tools I needed to complete my tasks, which were, to produce the most satisfied homeowner possible. Management came from the field they were not headhunted from other companies their experience directed related to the daily situations I found myself in.
","The only down sides that I can find, are workloads. The work load can be extremely high at times, a can be very low at other times not having enough work is probably the most stressful. The biggest yardstick in which I was measured by is number of claims completed and not having a lot of claims made me feel I wasn't contributing enough to make an impression on my management.

Pros
Repetitive . The job is mind numbing, it was great if you are going to school. Decent benefits and salary.
Cons
Repetitive . The job is mind numbing. A lot of lifers, so chances of promotion are little to none. Job is constantly changing due to layoff and absorbing other former coworkers duties. Facilities are dated.

Tue Jan 11 2011,N/A,,Administrative Assistant ,I would not recommend this workplace to anyone,5,"Benefits are ok. Managers are lenient when it comes to taking time off. Flexible hours..though not big on telecommuting. Projects are exciting..largest in the City of San Francisco.
","Lots of office politics. Poor communication between managers and staff. No end of year bonuses, no raises in almost five years. Lots of favoritism. A lot of under-qualified staff allowed to get away with doing less work than others. Good performance and attitude is not rewarded and barely acknowledged...whereas bad performance and bad attitudes are coddled and given preference. Morale is generally in the gutter. Gossipy office...semi-toxic environment. There are a few staffers who play the race card and get away with it at every turn. Some staffers manage their ""side businesses"" during company hours.
Advice to Management
Communicate better with your staff. Give annual performance reviews..even if no raise can be given. Pay your staff bonuses instead of the over-priced lobbyists. Praise your staff for doing good. Stop feeding the ""bottom-feeders"" that barely produce any good work and are never to be found in the office. Fire people that need to be fired! Show some loyalty to your good employees and don't force them to work with the toxic people who leech off the company and make everyone else miserable! The top three are: the ""executive assistant"" (supports only ONE person when this position normally supports FIVE to SIX), the ""land development associate"" (a created position for a staffer who came from accounting dept with no actual land development experience, came with a horrible, condescending attitude, one of those who works on their ""side business""), and stop taking advantage of the ""temporary admin assistant"" and pay her a competitive salary instead of the measly crumbs she's paid even though she is overqualified and is highly utilized by many of the departments.
