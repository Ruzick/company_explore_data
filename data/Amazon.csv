Sat Feb 20 2016, Senior Engineering Manager,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,"Exciting Work, Abusive Culture",2499,"Jeff Bezos and his ""S-Team"" are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for long-term growth. 

You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring. I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment.""
","The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.
Advice to Management
Don't pretend that the recent NY Times article was all about ""isolated incidents"". The culture IS abusive and it WILL backfire once stock value starts to drop. I'm an 8 year veteran and I no longer recommend former peers to interview with Amazon.

Fri Feb 23 2018, Software Development Manager,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,An Amazing Place to Work,782,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.
","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.

Tue Dec 17 2013, Software Development Manager,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,"Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others",1493,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
 - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
 - A chance to make a huge difference
 - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
 - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
 - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain
","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.
Advice to Management
Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data. The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal.

Thu Mar 23 2017,Anonymous,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,689,"This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.
","Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.

Headphones aren't officially allowed to be worn while working.
Advice to Management
No headphones because of safety concerns is absolutely BS and everyone knows it. ""You might not hear the fire alarms if you have headphones in"" is also BS since the fire alarms are incredibly piercing and are visible even to deaf and hard of hearing associates.
Acknowledge they are a snag risk on conveyors, but allow associates to wear them, and especially allow wireless headphones. Allowing one headphone at a time seems like a sensible compromise. The actual truth is that allowing headphones in the FC results in more hits to the metal detectors, and God forbid AP has to run someone through a metal detector a second time.
 Theft is an integrity problem with certain specific associates, and should not be used as an excuse to bludgeon the majority of the workforce with the boring whine of conveyors and fans for 10 hours a day. Boosting morale is just as important as boosting pay and this one thing throws a wet blanket on morale.

Tue Jan 12 2021, Recruiter,"Herndon, VA",Current Employee ,AWS Review,1,"If you are a technical professional or just a tech enthusiast, AWS is the place to work (over the other silicon valley players Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc). AWS is the leader in cloud computing. Better products, better services, more innovation as a faster pace than our competitors and always keeping the customer #1 (Amazon leadership principle ""Customer Obsession"" is not just a tagline). Joining AWS means joining Amazon, yes. But it also means you benefit from the Amazon stock price if you are awarded RSUs, which most full time employees are. It takes 4 years for RSUs to vest 100%, but time moves fast in this organization. You will work with some of the smartest minds in the industry. Plenty of room for career growth in AWS and Amazon (you can transfer from one to the other).
","Each department in AWS runs like it's own company. Very much a start-up feel. Not a lot of structure (which can be good and bad). New hires should expect at least 6 to 12 months to be fully ramped (not even kidding). Performance reviews are annual, but you need to be ""making a case"" for yourself all year long as the opinions of your colleagues and peers is taken into consideration. The performance/productivity goals for recruiters (sourcers specifically) is unrealistic. Be ready for high volume recruiting if you're a technical sourcer. It's not enough to meet the bar, you have to raise it to be promoted. This means on top of an unrealistic hiring goals, you also have to take on several side projects. You'll easily work a 60 hour week for the first 2 years if you want to be promoted. As with all jobs, it's all about your manager. Make sure when you interview, you are scheduled to speak with the person you would report to and make sure you ask a lot of questions about their management style. That being said, lateral transfers are common, so if you don't like your manager, it's fairly easy to get transferred to another team. Base salary is below industry standards, but they try to make up for with the total compensation package that includes a signing bonus and the RSUs.

Thu Jan 14 2021, Outbound Dock Worker,"West Jefferson, OH",Current Employee ,Great benefits but hard work,0,"If your a blue badge you get benefits from day one which includes holiday pay. Even if you don't work on that holiday you still get paid 8 hours for it. If you do work you get time and a half. You start with 10 hours of unpaid time off you can take whenever and get 20 more hours every quarter until you hit 80 hours. You start with 10 hours of paid time off plus you get 10 hours every 2 months for a total 60 hours a year. You start accruing vacation time the moment you start and accrue 40 hours in your first year. I work overnights and make 16.40/hr. Also, if you need to use unpaid time off, you don't have to call off or anything. You just don't show up and it takes it off automatically. Also they have an app called amazon A to Z where you can view your schedule at the bottom or use one of the tabs to see things like how much time off you have available, your pay stubs, and transfers. You can transfer to a different department as long as you have been a blue badge for 30 days. Blue badge employees don't have a point system like white badge employees. I don't much about the benefits or details of a white badge. You get two 30 minute breaks. One is paid and one is not. 8
","It's very hard work sometimes and can be hard on the body. It feels like I make 16.40/hr. You will barely be able to walk after your first week. I had to use a personal day just to recover but luckily I started on 12/27 and you have to use your paid time off before the end of the year so I used the 10 hours I started with and got 10 more on the first of January. If I recommend taking ibuprofen every day for the first two weeks. It will help stop the lactic acid from swelling your muscles so much. The turnover rate is high because the work can be very stressful sometimes. You also have a rate but I don't think its enforced too much on the dock. As long as your actually working and not goofing off you should be fine. If you're more than 3 or 4 minutes late it will use a whole hour of unpaid time. There are no increments. So if you're late I would recommend waiting for close to the hour mark to clock in or you won't get paid for it. I work 4 overnight shifts from 615pm to 445am. If you weren't working third shift before this job like I was, this can be a hard adjustment. But i get home around 530am sleep until 3 and leave to go back to work at 530. I have 2 hours to myself basically on the days that I work and for those four days my life is nothing but Amazon it feels like.

- Decent work load
- Good Benefits
","This comes from a young professional who is hoping to move on to a more technical role dealing with the cloud. After 4 years of being in the Data Centers:

- you will learn more about operations, logisitics, and leadership skills than technical.

- people will hire their friends and family who are under-qualified (both entry level and management)

- They want to push stocks on you instead of salary increases.

- poor internal company tool development. 

- management has poor work/life balance

","Experience at previous amazon warehouses counts for nothing here. I've also been told people coming in fresh from college are put on step plans to reach their career goals within the company, whereas if you're promoted internally (which is nearly impossible without a degree), you aren't offered those step plans.
Advice to Management
There are Tier 1 associates who have been working at Amazon for years, who show up every day and go above and beyond, without receiving even the smallest bit of acknowledgment. Start valuing amazon experience more than you value degrees by people who don't even know how Tier 1's jobs even work. Too many experienced Amazonians quit because they aren't given opportunities to move up despite knowing the business like the back of their hand.

Tue Jan 12 2021, Amazon Fulfillment Associate,"Shepherdsville, KY",Current Employee ,"Great ""for now"" job",0,"1) It's a job that pays modest wages. I started at $15 per hour. Better than McDonald's
2) Benefits are surprisingly good for this type of work. After one month medical benefits kick in automatically and at no additional cost. If you apply to be a blue badge (easy to do if you have the wherewithal), you can add dental and vision (really good vision) plus some other resources.
3) If you're worried about Covid, have no fear! They make sure people social distance and sanitize their stations often. Plus, on-site testing is available for free. If you test positive, they immediately give you two weeks paid leave from when you get your result back.
4) Free work shoes. Amazon gives each employee $105 voucher with Zappos to buy suitable shoes and/or insoles. That renews at the beginning of the year too.
5) You pretty much get what you expect. Depending on which part of the chain you work in, what you imagine is what you get. I was wary of applying because I'd heard horror stories from the news and a friend of mine who worked at Amazon in Washington that they wouldn't let you use the bathroom or get water during Prime week or some other stupid thing. Yeah, sometimes it's fast-paced, but what do you expect? It's a business. You work. For what you put in, they take pretty good care of you. 
6) It's not customer service or telemarketing.
","1) Ten hour shifts are not fun for a host of reasons. Your feet huuuuurt, especially if you are not used to being on them all day.
2) You've really got to take initiative to move upward from the bottom. If you see a chance to move up, be sure to grab it.
3) Getting a raise takes forever and you better work, honey.
4) It tends to be pretty mind-numbing stuff. You get pretty good at it over time, but that's like anything.
5) Leave is annoying and complicated. During 2020, we had to work on Thanksgiving (shorter shift), Christmas Eve (full shift...ugh), and NYE. You have to plan quite a bit to rack up substantial paid leave.
6) This is physical work. You have to move. You have to lift, bend, squat, reach, and briskly walk. Take your age and physical ability into account before you apply. Pregnant women be wary.

Advice to Management
Do not message the entire team via Chime and get on your soapbox when only one person needs to be called out. My manager sees me regularly but waited until I was away from my computer to make a negative call out. Remember: this is standard management behaviour at our company so by just writing this it is unlikely to ever change.

Advice to Management
Create incentives other than the dangling stock bonus carrot to recognize high performers. Be more transparent about work expectations with new hires versus giving them a view of one role while expecting them to wear 10 different hats once onboarded. Create true training modules and platforms to reduce the sink or swim learning curve. Encourage collaboration over call outs and you’ll likely have better employee retention.
