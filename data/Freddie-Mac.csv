Doesn't Recommend
Negative Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Freddie Mac full-time for less than a year
Pros
Brand recognition at a Fortune 500 Company, good and smart colleagues, state of the art physical office
Cons
Depends on your department. Upper management is controlling, corporate bureaucracy, limited opportunities for growth, back-stabbing, and culture around consultants is the WORST. People treat consultants like they are less than employees and there is a huge negative culture about being a consultant. You are removed from the rest of the ""real"" employees in almost every way. 

My first day on the job, I sat through a 4 hour orientation (normal freddie mac employees got 2 days), and each consultant was supposed to be picked up by their supervisor. My supervisor LITERALLY FORGOT ABOUT ME. ON DAY ONE. She never came to get me and I had to CALL HER. My new colleague gave me directions on how to get there, and once I found the building I walked with her to where I'd be working. I passed Freddie Mac employees working at their nice cubicles and got very excited to see where I'd be sitting. She led me to a long crowded table with 7 other people - and the spot where I was supposed to work was cluttered with old food crumbs, caked in dust, and had wires and was completely cluttered. They hadn't cleared off a space for me or cared one bit that I would be arriving. My new colleague left me to get situated and I spent the rest of the day thinking I had made a mistake.

After half a year of working there, I was given one hour's notice on a random Friday afternoon to pack up my things and go. No one was in the office and my supervisor and her boss were not there to walk me out. My full time co-worker had to and they felt super awkward escorting me out of the building.
Advice to Management
The most important things at a job are for how you start AND for how you finish, whether you are an employee or and employer. Shame on my supervisors for not having the courage to let me go in person, and shame on Freddie Mac for building such a fake culture.

Fantastic People - intent on meeting the mission, supporting each other, and getting things done. 
Quality of Life - Because it's about Mission and it's mostly Fantastic People, managing quality of life and balance between work and homelife is easier than most areas of the financial sector. 

The number of ""lifers"" at Freddie Mac, and multi-generation employees is a testament to the special nature of the platform. Freddie is a unique place to look at - certainly not for all, but if you're looking for a work/life balance at a place you can make a difference in a sector that is vitally important to the success of the country and your fellow Americans, with great people alongside you, there are few places you'll find better than Freddie.

Very attractive pay and benefits relative to the risk/reward profile of the company.
","The breadth of what Freddie does can be overwhelming and can lead to ""stove-piping"" across departments and divisions. This can be overcomes, but it'll be up to you to make that happen.

Freddie is a HUGE platform, so - like all platforms with huge positions - implementing changes that have material impact is difficult. ""Nimble"" is not a word that applies, typically, to large organizations. Don't walk in expecting a start-up environment.

","It is by far one of the worst places I have ever worked. Diversity and inclusion that they brag about does not exist; do not believe the pictures they post (Scam). It’s like working in down town New Delhi. The culture difference overwhelms you in a matter of weeks regardless of how tolerant you are. Language barrier greatly affects your work performance. 
Flexible work schedules work only for a few teams, the rest is just a clown fiesta every day. 
The supervisors/seniors are picked based on who they’re kissing up to rather than merit. Pay is on the low end/below that of the industry along with their benefits.
The recently updated modern work areas should work in theory, but there is no culture for it. People are loud, nosy and perhaps smelly. I have seen people spitting in the break room sink. I will stop here but The list goes on.

Now, that does not mean you can not use Freddie Mac as a stepping stone. Weigh your options and if this is the best at the time, don’t be scared to use it. But there are far better places to be as an employee.

Great teammates and co-workers that keep me going at my best every single day. They're actively working on getting the technology out of the stone age. Recognition for good work is getting better (SPOT Awards). Diverse workplace with lots of good people. Managers are flexible to things such as taking off early if needed and work from home/telework.
","There's a pretty high turnover rate in my division, which isn't entirely surprising (but getting better). Only some teams get the coaching and structure required to function as a true Agile team. Bureaucracy for IT processes makes performing duties external to your team at best incredibly slow and at worst nearly impossible. You need approvals for EVERYTHING. Work life balance is far better on the business side than the IT side from what I've noticed. Management will overload you with work if pressured from above or by the business side. Office comes with lots of politics. Communication between management and employees is spotty (depends on the manager and I've had 5 so far). Upper management receptive to change, but implement it either never or very slowly if it does not align with their vision.

I know it looked like the con list was longer than the pros, but in general, I think Freddie Mac is a good place to work in IT if you are cool under pressure and patient with the slow pace of change (which technology-wise is getting faster).

The CTO left after 6 months. From my cohort of entry level people , maybe 75% have left after discovering what the actual situation was. Very few remain. 

If you are a college grad looking for a job only go to Freddie Mac if you are desperate. 

We had lots of PowerPoint slides and weekend work. It was just a negative and sad culture. The code was very poor quality, we did better code in school projects. Agile is a joke. Product owners refuse to use the agile tools. Project managers are used as product owners.

","***Note to the people who answer these - don't bother with mine. I've read some of the posts and you've been answering with the same platitudes for literally years and if anything, this place has gotten worse. No humoring is necessary.***

IT is rife with dysfunction. If you love pointless meetings that never end, processes upon processes upon processes upon processes, complete risk aversion, management just passing the time with horrible decisions, alternate lifestyles constantly jammed in your face, lots of weekend work, relatively low pay, more PowerPoint decks than you can possibly imagine, and mostly sad or angry people jammed together in uncomfortable tables, then this is your place!! However, if you’re a talented IT person who does not like to be mired in endless, pointless processes, wants the tools they need to get the job done, takes risks and is generally a high-performer, stay away. You will not fit in here. Plus, they probably won’t give you the pay you want, anyway. 

Passive aggressiveness is a virtue here and it is punctuated by people manage by intimidation and scream the loudest getting promoted. This place generally has the saddest people I’ve ever seen. I thought it was me when I would pass people in the hallway and nod or say “hi” and get no response in return. I talked to others and apparently, this is a thing here!! Go figure!! It’s not surprising…read on. 

Promotion, pay, and hiring have been hijacked by processes and there is too much HR involved. The mind-numbing process in getting people promoted takes way too long – so good people give up and leave. What we have left are people that are willing to put up with this and generally do just enough to not get fired. What this means is that everything is a fire drill. Why? This is the only way to get people to do actual work. They won’t read emails, answer phones or respond to texts so the only way to get work done is have a fire drill. These fire drills are constantly happening and it is so very annoying – yet it is strangely necessary at Freddie Mac. 

You also can’t get the people you really need because Freddie doesn’t want to pay market rates. HR says they do studies and blah, blah, blah but all of us IT folks know that Freddie is at the very low end of the pay scale. So what happens is that you have to settle for your 3rd or 4th choice (if they're still waiting because HR/recruiting moves at their own pace, which is to say S-L-O-W) or you engage a consulting firm that will not hire Americans. Not an ideal situation. 

This place claims to be diverse but IT is the least diverse place I’ve ever seen. Freddie Mac is government funded and it’s a mystery to me why our tax dollars bailed out a company that is so in love with foreign consulting companies. You mean to tell me there are no US Veterans that would jump at the chance to work at Freddie? I know for a fact there are - but this company turns their back on them in favor of foreign consulting companies. Also remember that FREDDIE MAC WENT BANKRUPT and if it weren’t for the US Government, this place would not exist. Without government intervention, a place as dystopian as this would probably would not exist at all – it couldn’t!! Market forces would drive it and the rampant dysfunction out of business. If our tax dollars are paying for a place like this, there should be preference given to US Veterans. In true Freddie fashion they SAY they want US Veterans but their actions say something else. Believe me, I am surrounded by people who 100% no way could even possibly be US Veterans. Maybe they served in whatever country they came from…who knows. I do know they are not US Veterans. 

There has been a recent completion of a “space modernization” effort. I’m not sure what they meant by “modernization” but the definition I know of “modernization” does not involve cramming the most humans together in the most uncomfortable ways. Our desks are long tables with many people, so you have loud talking, strange smells, and distractions everywhere – and no privacy. There are so many people crammed together with giant rows of tables, our bathrooms get overcrowded. They make stadium bathrooms look pristine by comparison. They’re always packed and usually disgusting. Oh and when someone gets sick, it spreads around like wildfire because we’re all jammed in here together, having to share our disgusting bathrooms. That was an unexpected bonus!! Yay Freddie!! 

This “modernization” effort started with Freddie Management asking us to select what we preferred to have. My long table desk with 6 people on it was NOT even a selection. This was just foisted upon us. I imagine the folks who decided that this horrible arrangement is great for Freddie employees don’t actually have to work in it. I’ve never seen a VP at one of these sweatshop tables. Great job, Freddie!! 

I could go on and on about many other things but you get the idea. It’s not a habit of mine to do something like this but the story has to be told somehow. Complete corporate dysfunction like this should not be allowed to continue. You would think my thoughts and many others’ thoughts on this site would get through to management. I am, BTW, IN Freddie Management so all this stuff is right in my face - and I’m sure I could be more of the solution but the culture here is such that open, honest information sharing is a big risk if you’re not a VP (I mentioned Freddie’s HUGE risk aversion) so you can only do it if you’re willing to lose your job. This is yet another indication of Freddie’s toxic, dysfunctional culture. 

Anyway, It looks like someone reads these because someone from Freddie (I guess) answers them with the same template-like words speaking in the same platitudes and HR-speak, but I really don’t think they care – they SAY they do but I think that’s more for themselves and they really don’t - otherwise, things would be getting better and they are most definitely not.
 
Management has meetings to ask for feedback and we do endless surveys but most people don’t dare complain because if you do, you will not be promoted, or you will be slowly (or sometimes quickly) removed from your job. They say the surveys are anonymous but no one trusts that – nothing is anonymous. I know that as I am typing this. 

So people put up with this nonsense and Freddie management says the same things over and over to make themselves feel better. They have talked endlessly about culture this and change that but it’s getting worse, not better. I don’t expect anything to come from this note because it’s just been lip service for years - but Freddie’s actions show what management really thinks. Actions do speak louder than words. Well, I certainly hear you!! 

These huge, entrenched, cultural problems will only get better after a thorough house-cleaning and a reboot of how we treat our employees and contractors – and the US taxpayer - but I don’t expect anything to happen soon on that. Clearly, there are other motives at play and I have no idea what they might be. At least I can warn those of you thinking of a career here.

","Can be too many managers in one group. And they will cover for each other rather then help or protect their direct reports. Some managers have been with the company for way to long and refuse to learn the new technology or procedures. They will just ride your coattails instead of trying to adapt. Too many contractors as well. Number of contractors outnumber actual full time employees. Lack of accountability. HR makes it difficult to get rid of bad employees. Especially ones that are constantly late, still take extra long lunches and cannot perform their job to a point where other co workers must go behind them and double check their work.
Advice to Management
Too many managers in a group creates a confusing atmosphere. Who’s really calling the shots and it’s hard to trust them when one manager tells you to do something but the other over rules them and changes everything. Might be time to clean house on some managers that have been there too long and the polices, technology and procedures have past them by. If they can’t do it how can we as direct reports really get our jobs done. Make it easier to fire bad employees. If the standard is to be on time be courteous of lunch breaks and personal phone calls and sleeping on the job are acceptable then so be it but I’ve never worked at a company that allowed that except for Freddie Mac. And it’s infuriating that it’s even tolerated while the hard working employees pick up the slack and do double work to compensate for that one bad employee.

Thu Feb 07 2019, Communications Manager,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,"Best Place I have worked, but there is room for imrpovement with telework culture",3,"I love working at this company. They really value their employees. I find the pay competitive, and there are great benefits such as an onsite doctor, gym, and a five star cafeteria. I find my work interesting, and I have ample opportunity for training and learning.
","As a working mom, I need a company to have a flexible, telework- friendly work environment. On paper, Freddie Mac has this, but the culture and technology does not support it. Most senior leadership do not have a polycon system in their offices to support conference calls, which would allow remote employees to better participate in meetings. What's worse is that most conference rooms do not have polycons or even telephones at all. Many times, we have to use our cell phones and pass them around so who ever is speaking in the room can be heard by remote participants. This is just not in line with other consulting, financial, and technology companies in the area and is a big downside to recruiting staff, especially women. Another example of the culture is that, in most cases, I have to request the addition of a conference line to meetings. The expectation is that you be there, in person. 

The other thing I wish senior leadership would listen to is that their student loan repayment program is not working. It sends payments directly to your loan holder, at random and different days every month. Therefore our student loan repayment benefit is going directly to the banks (applied towards interest) and not towards the principal of our loans. It is very frustrating. 

Finally, they need to increase vacation days and maternity leave days. They aren't keeping up with the times.

Sat Dec 08 2018, Senior Systems Analyst,"McLean, VA",Former Employee ,Not a Good Place to Work as an IT Contractor,20,"Good cafeteria. Upper management encourages telework though leaves it up to managers.
","1) Contractors are treated like second-class citizens at Freddie Mac in some key ways. For example, you can’t park in the garages of the buildings you work in, but rather have to park far away in a contractors garage. Before that garage was built, you had to park in a rented lot and take a shuttle. In contrast, regular employees got to park in the garages below the buildings they work in. As a contractor you already know that you don't get the same opportunities regular employees do, but this particular inconvenience hits you every rainy and every cold winter day. If you're lucky, your manager will let you telecommute a day or twice a week, but not all managers allow their employees, especially contract employees, to telecommute.

2) Freddie Mac is converting over its regular cube-type spaces into very open office spaces on steroids. They claim it's to improve productivity, but really it's to pack more people -- more contractors -- into less space. The result is a noisy, crowded, very low privacy work environment with almost no dividers or barriers. You don't have desks anymore, you have work tables with computers. Freddie has added some nice features to the renovated areas, like more ""huddle"" rooms on the edges, but it doesn’t make up for the lack of desk privacy. If you are a person who likes a quieter, less distracted work environment, you will absolutely loathe this setup.

3) The Freddie Mac IT workforce is very un-diverse, as it is about 80-85% Indian immigrant H1B visa holders in their early to mid 30s. There are plenty of women among them, though, and so gender diversity is not a problem at least. As my last job had been a work environment with more diversity not only in ethnicity, nationality, and culture but age as well, it was an unpleasant shift to come to work in such a nondiverse environment.

4) Contractors greatly outnumber regular employees, and do more work than regular employees. I felt at times the role of Freddie Mac contractors is to actually do the real work and keep things afloat while regular Freddie Mac employees spend 25-30% of their time out on training and at conferences.
Advice to Management
Give your contractors more perks, starting with allowing contractors to park in the garages below their buildings. Abandon the open-office conversion project, as studies show open office spaces increase stress, lower workplace productivity, and increase worker sick days by 50%. Increase ethnic, national, cultural, and age diversity in your IT workforce. Start a program to hire older out-of-work American citizens -- and especially veterans -- who can be retrained in new IT skills.

Fri Oct 05 2018, Systems Analyst,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,Systems Analyst - Prf,10,1. The company gym is a state of the art facility in the premises but open only to employees. No ,"ltants.
2. Free Flu shots on mentione dates by HR.
3. Flexible timing, good insurance coverage.
4. Fantastic company for ladies, the career growth rate of female employees are phenomenal.
5. Upgraded cafeteria.
6. Big parking space.
7. Lot of internal training available on calendar.
Cons
1. Worked here as a consultant for 2 years before joining as Full Time. Believe me or not, I enjoyed the best time as a Consultant where there is more to do and lots to learn than employees working for 10..20..30 years who have more politics to do than good work. That will make you severely frustrated, a lot happens behind closed doors and most of them are good to keep the rumors and noises alive. They will never knowledge share which shows their insecurity for not doing anything worthwhile for years.
2. Workspace is shrinking every year. Forget cubicles, i.e. three people sitting next to each other in same team cannot attend same webex meeting from desk as there is echo due to close proximity. Privacy is something which don't exist and attending a meeting over webex in peace is remotely possible. Business area still manages to get better sitting arrangements but IT place is crowded and considered out of class.

3. Food in cafeteria is over-priced considered to the pay Freddie gives to its employees. Advice to HR will be to survey the apartment rents within 4-10 mile radius of Freddie Mac. That will give them some ground level reality of where the Freddie Mac office is located and what's the pay scale offered.

4. HR's encourage to apply to internal jobs thru portal. So apply to as many internal positions as possible but you wont be interviewed unless the manager has opened the position specially for you. In other words the manager should know you personally to work with you. This is an unspoken truth.

5. Policies are out-dated and HR is trying to get them straight. An interesting policy to share, unless you are full time for an year with Freddie Mac, you are not entitled for three weeks of family leave(paternity) to bond with new borns. So plan it wisely. 

6. Its a Trillion dollar company but it does not trust you straightaway after joining, so company contribution for 401K will only start after you complete an year as full time.

7. Work overtime for nothing extra.

8. Most departments give two days remote work due to traffic and other considerations. But employees need to check that before joining because the work from home is at the discretion of the department head. So nothing for granted. Check before you move.
Advice to Management
1. To HR - Please survey the surrounding area and fix the salary.

","There is no consistency for teleworking/flexible work across the company. Some Divisions are flexible; others are quite rigid. Additionally, the modernization project over the past few years reduced the amount of cubicle space in order to fit as many as possible. Though it has been touted as ""how young people work"" it has been counterproductive for the most part.

Very active employee resource groups. Many to choose from and ways to become involved. 

Stellar leadership of HRDI, in particular Jacqui Welch & Dominica Groom are very personable, connected, and make you feel appreciated. 

Flexible work options that encourage and support telework where possible. 

Strong onboarding program.

Although a GSE, recognition and effort to remain current and relevant within industry and outside industry is apparent. There are opportunities for best practice sharing and capability building though conference attendance and other external events.
","No flexibility of offering additional vacation as part of offer process for management level position. This is not consistent with blue chip companies.

Technology such as webex is inconsistent at best. 

No formal mentoring/coaching center of excellence to help embed relational learning. At this time, employee resource group mentoring circles are the only visible offering which are inconsistent in their methodology. Having a CoE would help provide greater structure for offerings.

The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) seems dated and underwhelming. The only tangible evidence of existence seems to be offerings for chair messages.

","The fixed SOW model to group of selected vendors has destroyed company culture. The management is too close to some of the vendor folks (team leads, scrum masters etc to name a few) and give more preference to them then employees - possibly because the management is not project savvy and dependent on contracting company for their personal growth. Even though i was an employee I felt like a contractor. The management hangs out with vendor people after hours and give preferential treatment. Lot of asian vendors have totally ruined the company culture as they're busy promoting their companies. Beware of companies like: TCS, Hexaware, Brillio, Cognizant to name a few.
Advice to Management
Stop depending on vendors and giving them upper hand for your personal gain, and give your employees equal opportunity. HR wake up and take complaints of discrimination and retaliation seriously. Focus less on ethical training and more on practical implementation of it. Upper management focus on your lower management bad practices, limit these fixed SOW vendors as they're ruining company culture, its not the same company which it once was.

People here even seem to have hard time smiling at people who dont belong to thier closed group! Envoronment and mangement is below average. Top management is the worst at resource planning and doesnt care for the team.

Still not quite to employees working remote full time but two days per week at home seems to still be the norm and most managers are flexible for employee needs.

","I believe some of the culture change they have been trying to instill, including creativity and risk taking, is frequently at odds with what is being reinforced.

I have been working at Freddie Mac full-time for more than a year
Pros
On site cafeterias.
Free parking. 
Gym.
Cons
Sliding downhill since conservatorship, trying to redefine itself. Change is coming at a glacial pace. Employees get tired of doing the same tasks over and over and leave, or hope to stretch to retirement. Work centers on compliance and process, not innovation. Hard to move to other teams. Uneven - some managers are hard-working and knowledgeable, others are archaic and show poor people skills. Unless you want to specialize in the mortgage sector, it will most likely not meet your needs for professional development.
Advice to Management
Competition from the private sector will come. Drive the culture change needed; invest in your employees and make management responsive and accountable.

","Opportunities for promotion are limited and promotion decisions are not always made on the basis of experience or qualifications, in part because senior management frequently changes and senior managers often know little about the work of most of the employees.
Advice to Management
Employees with critical skills should be nurtured and supported. Senior management should do a better job getting to know company employees and their job duties and work assignments.

Sun Oct 16 2016,N/A,"McCleans Corner, MD","Technical Manager in McCleans Corner, MD",Honest Opinion - from current Manager,4,"Decent pay (average , sometimes lower than industry standards), average benefits and nice gym. Freddie Mac is a place that is good for right out of college, the company has a big push to hire young talent , which is awesome, only to fall short in the retention practice. Freddie Mac is slowly creeping towards newer technology- but still uses old technology for a lot of its practices (Lotus Notes). 

For new managers and upcoming leadership - it is a good place to get your feet wet, but not much after. It seems to get stale and the career growth is very much limited by the 20-30 year veterans of the position/title above yours, keeping the promotion out of reach. 

There have been accusations of the work environment being hostile, and I would agree to an extent. It largely depends on what team you are hired onto and who your direct Manager is. 

Overall - I would recommend Freddie Mac to a newly graduated young professional who is looking to start out their career - but not much after that. The industry (Banking in general) has far better opportunities that pay better and offer better benefits.
","The accusation of leadership being ""disconnected"" is completely true - Directors and above seem to be oblivious to what is actually happening below them, which often times leads to a severe disconnect between staff and the ""higher ups"".

Embrace change - this is very big, Freddie Mac has a culture of not introducing change or embracing new technology. Sure - they ""preach"" about the idea of embracing change at the top level, but below that there is no action. 

Slow Career Growth - again, teams have leadership roles that sit stagnant for 10+ years, often times with the same Directors/Managers. This leaves little room for growth or advancement.

Tue Jul 05 2016,Anonymous,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,Freddie Mac has many areas for improvement,4,"- Freddie Mac has good 401K benefits, as it will match 6% of your 401K contribution.
- Some teams at Freddie Mac have good work-life balance. The key here is to find a good team. A good VP, director, and manager help a lot with achieving proper work-life balance.
","- Unfortunately, Freddie Mac has no process for providing anonymous upward feedback for managers. As a result, Freddie Mac has a lot of mediocre managers who aren't good people managers and/or managers who don't properly train their subordinates. This fosters an environment of complacency, and those weak managers will continue to operate this way until Freddie Mac provides a tool to inform them of their opportunities for improvement. 
- Freddie Mac is in a state of conservatorship and is not growing, which along with a state of uninformed self-satisfaction among managers and directors, provides few opportunities to advance one's career. If Freddie Mac instituted an anonymous upward feedback tool and encouraged its use, managers would improve and Freddie Mac would be able to rotate or remove below average managers, which would provide additional opportunities to advance.
- Every year Freddie Mac employees are provided with the opportunity to provide feedback/recommendations about their work environment to HR and upper management. Sadly, during my tenure here (2 + yrs) upper management has never specifically addressed the feedback/recommendations they receive. There is no acknowledgement that Freddie Mac is working hard to improve in areas that the surveys identify as areas for improvement. Employees are given NO insight into what upper management thinks or believes are legitimate areas for improvement or areas they are working on. As a result, employees may write the same recommendations year after year, with no reported progress being made with respect to those recommendations.
- There is an uneven distribution of work outside of teams and within teams, this results in some employees having little to do, and other employees being overworked. 
- I agree with the other reviews that suggest that Freddie Mac is not the best environment for recent college graduates due to the lack of growth opportunities, below average managers (many of whom aren't interested in properly training their subordinates), and uneven work distribution, which can result in some people being overworked and others with an abundance of idleness.
Advice to Management
My advice to upper management is 1) to implement an upward feedback tool, 2) act on the upward feedback they receive, 3) to report back to employees regarding the overall findings from the surveys and what's being done to address them, and 4) be transparent about where Freddie Mac is with respect to addressing employees' concerns.

For one, the program is NOT rotational, which means that new hire do not get to experience different positions; each new hire is stuck in a position for the whole year.
Next, there was no on-the-job training at all. We spend the first two weeks learning some basic concepts...and that's it. After the firs two weeks of on-boarding, we are thrown into projects.
Third, mentors are not assigned to the new hires, we had to seek them out on our own.

","Before I realized what a backward company I was in at Freddie, I recommended a friend for an open position through my contracting company. This guy was/is a seasoned Java developer/applications architect who had been through high profile contracting gigs starting with MCI. He had a strong resume Verizon/AT&T/IBM consulting gigs, etc.

He was interviewed by the Indian director and three of his peeps. There was **no** cultural diversity in the interview panel who proceeded to pepper the candidate with the most obscure, irrelevant technical questions you can imagine, at a rapid non-stop pace. To his credit, my friend ended the 'interview' early and excused himself.

The director complained to my contracting company that they were sending him sub-standard candidates. Well, here's the 'breathtaking' part - the successful candidate was Indian, and he was the cousin of a member of the interviewing panel. He was technically weak and his written/spoken English skills were rudimentary.

But this guy was connected and although we were under whip-cracking deadlines by management, our new team member was given a free ride to float off to two hour lunches three or four times a week with his peeps.

There are talented IT pros out there that are US citizens that can't get a break and Freddie would bend over into impossible positions to make sure ""H1B"" Visa candidates were treated royally. That's breathtaking.

","Many of the cohort were unclear about what their role was at the company until we arrived for our first day. Even during our orientation program, a few of us were still switched around without any input from us. For some in the cohort, the positions that they ended up in were a perfect fit. For many, not so much. The program used to be a rotational program, but the phased that out due to complaints of people having to sit through 6 month rotations in areas they did NOT want to have a career in (e.g. someone looking to be a Project Manager having to do a Developer rotation). Now, you are placed into a role, and unless you make a very hard effort to be switched within the first 3 months, you are essentially stuck in that position for the rest of the year. In this latest cohort, it has led to numerous people leaving the company after <1 year of service due to the difficulty of moving laterally.

-Bureaucracy. Many meetings. Stagnant and uncaring bosses. Everyone is risk averse. Pushing for change for efficiency is greeted with quiet opposition rather than support.
-The Multifamily division in particular has a sense that management pressure is driving the entire group to the very edge of risky and unethical. This filters throughout the entire division.
-Also, the company seems to care more about the hours you work than the work you produce. In fact, measurement of output seems infrequent or nonexistent in many cases.
-Finally, as with all jobs, the particular boss you get makes a HUGE difference in your job quality.

GMAC ResCap (Residential Capital) was a financial service company that focuses on residential estate loans that went bankrupt in 2013. It was part of General Motors' finance group GMAC which was then taken over by Ally Financial.

Change has ground to a halt. There is no domain knowledge in the existing group. Our IT leaders upgrade email to Outlook and think they have solved an immense problem.

Nice and smart folks at lower to mid-level. Flexible work arrangement (although this is driven more to save the real-estate cost) and a small gym (although it is not promoted by management). Also happens to be one of the largest employer in the area.
","The place is marred with ineffective management - the place is known for large and ineffective meetings leading to another such meetings without any decision, leaders change their mind in every meeting and the teams keep succumbing to their whims by changing the style and graphics of the powerpoints. Many leaders have hired consulting teams to just make the presentations and a handsome speaker with nicer slides equates to the best idea in the room. There are about 200 VPs for less than 5000 employees and the lust for kingdom and fiefdom creates hierarchy that is rampant with sycophancy and thus the talent sulks. It is not the work but how one moves the parts is the theme. Most of the projects are inflated by at least 1000% and take longer and longer to execute. Managers of failed projects get promoted while the ones who took risk and innovated get bypassed. Unable to attract talent from outside, it has to hire lame people at a better position at the cost of further demoralizing the workforce. Management speaks a lot but just can not communicate. The CEO keeps showing the distaste for consultants but why is it not translating to his subordinate?

Fri Aug 22 2014, Senior Director,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,"Correcting review ""All about saving money ...",9,"The company still provides matching contributions to the 401(k) plan -- up to 6% of comp, subject to IRS limits. They provide a temporary contribution to offset the termination of the pension plan (but it's not nearly high enough to make up for the loss of future years of service under the pension plan). Senior management's comp is governed by law and the FHFA -- they are not ""fatcat executives"" -- at least not when compared to executives at financial institutions that are not in conservatorship.
","In the past few years, Freddie Mac has cut employees and benefits. They terminated the pension plan. They reduced the severance plan. Yes, they got rid of free soda. Compensation is stagnant (raises of 1% - 2% per year). They eliminated matching contributions for employee's charitable contributions. They have increased the employee's share of the cost of health insurance premiums. Notwithstanding their promotion of flexible work arrangements, many managers frown upon the practice. They have revised the compensation system to favor ""above plan"" employees to the detrimiment of ""on plan"" and ""below plan"" employees and, at the same time, they have instituted an employee performance system that forces managers to rate 10% of employees as ""below plan."" Consequently, some ""on plan"" employees will be rated ""below plan"" and will received reduced compensation without any justification for such a rating or reduction. Given this recent experience, I would expect comp and benefits to be further reduced in the future.
Advice to Management
Despite wanting to be a ""great"" company, senior executives manage towards mediocrity when it comes to compensation and benefits. If the company wants to be like Google, it needs to provide comp and benefits like Google, not the ""midpoint of the comparator group of similar financial services companies"" (HR double speak) that they always say they look at when determining comp and benefits.

","Politics and game playing are the true drivers of success beyond the lower level workers, and impact the work for everyone.

If you have a good manager they can shield you from much of this and allow sometimes interesting work and great benefits to all work in your favor. If you have a mediocre or bad manager (more common since very hands off seems to be the norm) you're left to fend for yourself in an increasingly bad environment.

","Despite management's mission to change the culture of Freddie Mac, it still operates similar to that of any other stereotypical government agency. Still too much bureaucracy to feel you can make any real difference on your own. There is a culture clash between those who have been at Freddie Mac for many years and those who came on after conservatorship. My experience has been that long-term employees often like to minimize, micromanage or withhold information from newer employees to make themselves feel like they have the upper hand. One's experience at Freddie Mac greatly depends on what division and department one ends up in.

Wed Apr 24 2013, Technology Analyst,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,Good/bad work experience depends on a lot of things,1,"I know some people have had bad experiences at Freddie Mac, and it seems to be more likely that people who have bad experiences at a company are more likely to write a Glassdoor review than people who have had good experiences at a company.

I've had a very positive experience working at Freddie Mac. I know some of my other colleagues in similar positions have not encountered as much exciting work (or as much work in general) as I have, so I understand why they are not as happy. The underlying culture, people, and benefits are good. I think a person's day-to-day working experience changes their opinions about the company as a whole rather than just their position/work.

Some teams are better to work for than others here. I feel bad that some people haven't had as good of an experience as I have had. I guess it's hit or miss.

• Most teams allow flexible work arrangements. This includes teleworking and choosing your own hours within a certain range (e.g., start between 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM, end between 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM). Also the minimum amount of hours a full-time employee needs to work is 38.75. An extra 15-minute paid break per day helps keep the doctor away.

• Amicable and productive work environments. Most employees are friendly, cooperative, hard-working, intelligent, etc. If you treat others with respect, patience, and benevolence, you will generally receive it in return.

• Tightly-knit, engaging teams. I've had the benefit of working with various teams under various managers and have seen a beneficial team dynamic that exists in them. I've also seen this as an outside observer while working with other teams on projects.

• On-campus benefits. There are pretty decent cafeterias in all but one of the main offices in McLean. There's a gym in the main home office and a smaller exercise room in one of the non-main offices in McLean. Although there is no on-site day care service, Freddie Mac partners with a day care service nearby to give employees subsidized family care services. Also every break room has a refrigerator, microwave, coffee machine/hot water dispenser, and a fountain machine.
","• Contingent Workers (CWs) are not treated as well as full-time employees. They can't use every parking garage, they can't use the on-site gym, they don't get benefits, they typically have to share cubicles/desks with other CWs, etc. I feel like this could absolutely be better. I know other companies do not treat CWs the same way as Freddie Mac.

• High-level reorganizations have been happening somewhat frequently as upper management comes and goes. It doesn't necessarily have a detrimental effect on the rest of the company, but it can make things confusing sometimes and can evoke anxiety about the near-term future of the company.

• As has been stated in other reviews, salaries are not as competitive as other companies in the industry. This is to be expected, though, when you consider where Freddie Mac was a few years ago and its current conservatorship with FHFA.
Advice to Management
Be more visible and integrated with the teams you manage. I know you're extremely busy, but it helps workers' morale when they can formally and informally engage with the people they work for, no matter how brief that engagement is.

(Upper-upper management has recently been making a better effort to engage with the rest of their teams in the company)

Thu Jan 19 2012,N/A,"McLean, VA","Loan Processor, Senior in McLean, VA",Work with a great team and you'll love it - but this is hit and miss.,4,"Some departments and managers far superior to others when it comes to promotions, work/life balance, friendliness, professionalism, knowledgeable upper management, etc.
I work part time and I have fantastic benefits and a salary that could not be beat in 2009 - however, the conservatorship/government has not allowed raises, nor bonuses, for the last two years. So you get the salary you get. Also, for those being hired on in 2012, the benefits will be far less generous than what those of us hired prior to 2012 have.
When I started at Freddie Mac I was taking the job just to have a job (graduated from college in the middle of the recession). They even paid for my 3 remaining college courses to complete my degree in a completely unrelated field from normal FM'ers. But I quickly loved the people I worked with, a small group of expert underwriters, and my director was absolutely awesome. Very patient and ecouraging of moving upward within the company - something I wasn't interested in doing, because I loved my job and my group. So instead, when I ran out of things to do (because I finished my given tasks much more quickly then my predecessor), she would hunt for more resposibilites for me to take on. This worked in my favor, because I have a far wider range of responsibilites and skills now. 
Good for promotions if you know the right people - my predecessor went from being a Loan Processor, but got in good with the VP and my director and moved up to a Project Manager, and then on to working in Fraud (something it normally takes years to accomplish).
","I can only speak for my department, but being a company that's good for promotions when you ""know the right people"" can sometimes be damaging. Especially when the person you are putting in place is completely inexperienced. Basically, my department had a reorganization and my director took a new position to remain in our old department. The director she was replaced with was very friendly and obliging to our needs, but completely unfamiliar with anything that my group did. At the same time, a new VP and a new Senior Manager were hired. All of which directly oversee our group. Luckily my group is completely self-sufficient (all have worked at FM for a long time) and did not need a lot of oversight, or direction. However, having a supervisor who does not understand what you're job is, or what you're doing on a daily basis, can be very frustrating. And lately our department has been all about ""changing for the better"". Combine this with the government breathing down the company's neck, large layoffs, no raises or bonuses, poor company image, little information being shared concerning our future and, well...it wasn't long before half the members of my happy little group were leaving for other departments they believed to be more stable. You essentially have 3 people telling you to do things that don't make any sense and do not understand what it is you do in the first place (at least not in depth). They are definitely trying their best to learn and understand, but it's just as frustrating. I still am very satisfied with my job, because I'm also self-sufficient and know what I should be doing, on top of being allowed to work from home, great benefits, etc.
Advice to Management
Enforce training with predecessors for senior management when/if at all possible. Hire managers who already work closely, or within, the group they will be overseeing if at all possible. At least go with most qualified individual, not the individual who knows someone up the ladder.

","Zero direction. Management often confuses their best interest with ours. For example....management has spun the whole executive compensation debate into an internal agenda on defending the average employee's pay. No American cares what I make. They care what the executives make and how much their ""deferred compensation"" in. Oh yeah....we aren't allowed to call our bonuses, ""bonuses""...they are either short term incentives, long term incentives, or some other long-winded way of saying bonus. And if you work here, don't expect to get one. At least one that's worth a darn. Ever see Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase? I would be happy to get the ""Jelly of the month club"" gift certificate. 
If you change jobs (internally), don't expect to get any more than a 5% increase in pay, even if that increase doesn't put you anywhere close to where Freddie's own internal pay scale says you should be.

","Officially, the White House and Congress say they will ""wind down"" Freddie Mac (and Fannie Mae) in 5 to 7 years. Company management tries to keep morale up, but even upper management is racing for the door one by one. Plus,the company is in conservatorship, so management can not do anything without prior approval from the regulator, FHFA. Even the weekly phone messages from the CEO to employees are screened in advance by FHFA. The company is required by the government to make loan modifications that hurt profitability and is forbidden by the government to take steps to raise revenues.
Advice to Management
Go private and throw off FHFA oversight by any means possible, even if that means spinning off much of the company. The retained portfolio and government backstop will be taken away eventually anyway. Freddie Mac can not survive as a GSE anymore because it has lost all of its old friends on Capitol Hill.

Thu Feb 10 2011,N/A,"McLean, VA","Technology Services Employee in McLean, VA",Too much uncertainty right now,3,"Depending on who is your manager, the flexibility can be very good and work life balance is stressed. I've heard from some people that they are very limited in their ability to work from home or the flexibility of their schedule. I am a manager here and I am very flexible with my staff and as long as I can reach them and they are dependable and available, I have no problem letting them work from home. I get the same thing from my manager. 

The overall pay package, for mid level management is good. Salaries were lower a few years ago but HR implemented a market based compensation structure and, at least in the manager pool and higher (I believe), compensation is good. However there has been some recent murmurings of changes to bonuses and long term compensation amounts, so who knows what will happen.

Other benefits such as the on location Wellness Center with doctors, on site gym and multiple cafeterias make the downsides of working here ok.
","The IT department has recently had layoffs and there is a great uncertainty on what will happen to the future of Freddie Mac. The future of Freddie Mac is outside the control of the company but it's a big headwind to overcome. Recent layoffs and G&A reductions even build to the uncertain environment.

There also is bureaucracy here and to get things done is always an effort. Freddie Mac has gone way overboard in segregating what you can and can't do. You used to have people who knew entire systems and how they interacted with other applications, but everyone's been broken up and can only do a small piece of things. It makes it hard to get your job done when you have to call 3 different groups because they each have a piece of something.

FRE a great place to work if you have personal obligations outside of work requiring you to have a non-demanding/flexible work schedule. If you are interested in going back to school, or have children, family member that requires a huge time commitment, then FRE is a great place to work. If your goal is to advance professionally, be challenged or make an impact then I would not recommend FRE.
","- General lack of professionalism 
- No clear direction on company strategy 
- Peer pressure not to over achieve
- No growth opportunity 

To say the least, the company is in great flux as the fate of the GSE’s are being determined on the hill. This leaves no direction or motivation to employees to meet deadlines, achieve goals or make an impact. Many directors/senior managers, have been promoted due to putting their “time in” (i.e. working in the same role for over 10 years) and not for their abilities. Most people are just waiting it out for a generous retirement and/or compensation package to be offered.

","Senior management keeps saying that it wants the company to become more efficient and more effective, yet continues to ignore the management practices that would do just that.

One might conclude that to senior management, the appearance of progress is more important than actual progress.

","They don't respect employees. They say they promote work/life balance but in reality it doesn't happen. If you try to have a life outside of work you are viewed as not being devoted to the job or the company and you feel guilty even though you know you put in a good day's work. They don't appreciate the long tenured employee as they have laid off a substantial number of employees who were there more than 20 years but they keep hiring ""college hires"" at a cheaper salary but they don't know the business.

Listen to employees the next time you want to come out with some funky product or program. Those of us with a credit background new the alternative documentation programs were a bad idea but you wouldn't listen to us. You just kept seeing $$$$. Now as a result the company is in the ground and many good employees are gone. Improve the communication!!! It has been a problem for years. You need to be honest with employees and not treat them like they are idiots or like they don't matter.

There are a lot of options for ongoing learning and you will feel supported from your supervisors and the team around you. There are lots of times to share ideas with supervisors who are usually open to ideas. The culture embodies empowerment although it is obvious that some employees are not ready for change. The hours offer a work life balance and the employee sponsored perks are also attractive. Team work here is one of the best things that is offered and it is great to know that you have others who work as hard as you do.
","Communication can be improved but the monthly newsletters are always good. There is often great recognition of employee achievements listed in the newsletter but other than that, there is not a lot of recognition throughout the company. I would also like to see more mentoring, especially for interns who may not have time to attend the networking groups. More diversity would also be helpful and Freddie Mac may want to consider being more proactiv in bring about change that includes more women and minorities throughout the company. Feedback should be pursued by the employee as supervisors are not always on top of it.
