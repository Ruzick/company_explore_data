Tue Jan 26 2021, Data Science Associate,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,If you’re a POC professional looking for a strong networking community and talent development pipeline look no further!,2,"CEO and leadership has an incredible commitment to D&I anti-racist initiatives and has a blooming Global Black Community CRG and Latino CRG (I’m Latino myself) and this has made creating and expanding a network possible even while working remote the past year. Opportunities for advancement and internal hiring is constant and available. Opportunities to grow are there IF you really shine and are excellent. You also need to be known, build a brand, and have a cereer mentor AND sponsor. Otherwise promotions are hard to come by. Yearly education benefits are available as well. Super incredible work life balance (not like banks or consultant companies) and Pfizer is very flexible. Get most of your work done at night? Then take the day to do other stuff. Meetings with China at midnight? Sleep in until whenever the next day. Pay is decent, not the bottom of the curve not not like banking/consultant level either and our engineers get paid similar to the likes of other tech companies. But it’s worth it for the benefits, the leadership, flexibility to have a whole life outside of work. Also crazy maternal and paternal leave (6-9months off with pay). It’s a company filled with lovely, committed, & intelligent colleagues who bring A LOT of value to Pfizer’s culture and shape the core essence of Pfizer’s new brand.
","It’s not like other companies where there is a specific promotion timeline, to move up in pay grade levels you usually have to apply internally for another position at a higher grade level. Other option is promotion within your current role ... but even then it’s never certain and entirely depends on your performance (has to be above and beyond) as well as who “has your back” when it comes to discussing your compensation.

They will tell you they need to eliminate repetition and so mana layers of the organization when in fact they add ""new layers"" and ""new positions"" to accommodate and promote those within the circle of the upper management. Too much favoritism. They talk about minorities and females in the workplace but yet they are very few in upper management roles. If you are looking for just a job this is the place to be.

Make the performance based raise expectations much more realistic and attainable. Give a cost of living increase every single year.

- Decent pay
- Bonuses
- Good health insurance
","- Not professionally challenging
- Site culture is mired in the past
- Too many managers. Past layoffs when the site was Wyeth resulted in an accumulation of managers.
- It is very difficult to fire people at Sanford. This results in the site carrying a lot of deadweight and the outperformers eventually getting burned out and quitting.
- Engineering jobs here are all paperwork. You will spend all your time generating reports/documents for auditors that no one will every really read. They just serve as placeholders in case FDA asks for something.
Advice to Management
You need to change site culture and stop operating based on fear. Because it is so difficult to get fired, a lot of people have realized they only have to do the bare minimum to keep their jobs. This results in competent workers having to make up for all the deadweight. They eventually get overworked and quit as a result. You also need to pay market rates for employees. You cannot sit back and say Sanford has a lower cost of living than Raleigh. You are directly competing against all the companies in RTP for skilled employees. People constantly walk out the door (especially from Gene therapy) because another company offers them 20-30% more pay. Stop agreeing to everything auditors say/ask. At some point, you need to actually stand your ground on some issues. GMP does not mean being a bobblehead YES! to everything FDA questions you on. You have a lot of brains on site, put them to use generating proof that the way you do things is safe and correct.

- Benefits are hard to match without spending 3-5 years somewhere else (Great Medical, Dental, Vision plans, Start with 3-4 weeks of PTO)
- Open culture and strong focus on what you do here, directly impacts a patients life, and you see this regardless of pay grade.

- Management: Despite the first year of 3 at this site being under strict and unpleasant management treating salaried exempt employees like hourly employees, the greater bulk of management truly cares about their direct reports and employee moral/Greivances.
","My team is so small this review could used to take action against me but there are some serious cons

- Career Mobility: 90% of the time a professional job is posted, there is already an internal candidate the hiring manager knows they want. This makes moving across departments or into an area you don't interface with regularly extremely difficult.
- Work life balance: Team was treated as hourly employees in terms of being scheduled and working 6 people 24/7/365, and were classified as salaried under the guise of ""Career Mobility"" instead of the fact that it would cost them ~$30k a year to pay us the overtime as OTE employees

- Site Specific Issue: Pfizer Kalamazoo location formally Upjohn/Pharmacia employees that have stuck through the merger are mostly nearing retirement. A lack of a concise means of preparing replacements for this large departure of employees over the last several years resulted in a significantly longer lead time in getting these roles filled and up to speed. Not to dismiss the loss of first hand knowledge of critical infrastructure and equipment over time.

Fri Mar 20 2020, Senior Associate,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,MBA Finance Rotation Program,0,". Great pay for MBA's with little to no finance experience.
. Program introduces you to many aspects of the business.
. Summer Friday's are really daylight savings Friday's. If you're done with your work, you end at 2pm on Friday's from when the clocks are pushed forward until they are moved back (March - November).
. Good benefits. Medical is good and they offer a bonus 401k deposit.
",", No checks and balances in the program. Don't offer reviews of managers to the rotationals. Out of my four rotations, two managers have been awful and did not have meaningful projects to work on. Completely wasted my time.
. They say second years have priority over first years for placement which isn't true. I got my 3rd option in my last rotation. First years got placed in my first two options.
. Not guaranteed placement after the program.
. Pfizer is going through a restructuring. It's becoming a smaller company and realistically there are no finance jobs. The CEO announced in January of 2020 that finance jobs along with other functions will be cut.
Advice to Management
. For the program, have comprehensive reviews of the managers requesting rotationals. Some groups just request them because it's free labor but honestly they don't deserve one. They are all about growing the program but realistically it should be shrunk because they don't have enough quality rotations.

","If one calculates their hourly wage with respect to the hours they work, the total compensation is actually very low compared to the industry. In addition, the addition of compensation time for constantly working overtime is thrown out by leadership, despite leadership themselves coming to work late and leaving earlier than everyone else.


The amount of backstabbing is beyond reproach. Leaders will go as far as to fabricate false , yet negative information to their colleagues, and this results in lower level colleagues doing the same via gossip, and going as far as to ""spying"" on each other for managers. It does not matter how well your work ethic is, or how well you get along with the overwhelming majority of the people. The smaller ""clique,"" along with the managers will find a way to bring you down and give you a miserable time if they felt you have wronged them in the slightest ways. Even if you challenge (courteously and politely, of course), on their ""science,"" or whatever science they claim.


Location is well...not good, and because of this, talented and bright individuals are a scarcity. Anyone who has those qualities has already left for other opportunities outside of the area.


During candidate interviews, managers will go as far as to claiming that very few people have left, despite extremely large troves leaving.


As a final note, sexual harassment is not uncommon there, and oftentimes goes unpunished for long periods of time. An individual was finally fired for constantly sexually harassing women across multiple groups, but has been doing it for 20+ years before his termination. Everyone at the site who was aware of the individual was well aware of his behavior.

- Rudderless ship; new strategies every other year with little / no progress to show for it.
- Poor training organization (Pfizer, not just Consumer Healthcare)

","EXTREMELY bureaucratic. Each person feels powerless to make real change given all the layers. Work arrangements are too flexible and result in majority of business being conducted over WebEx, largely because of fractured nature of group spread between NJ, NY, and Tennessee. People in NJ might have a boss in NY or TN, who then has a boss in NJ, etc. I've never seen anything like it in my career. This all leads to virtually no business relationships being built and diffuses accountability. No camaraderie within department; morale is low depending on which office you are in. People brought over in acquisitions seem to just be hanging on until retirement, unenthused about anything. Processes are inefficient and highly rigid, leading to the strictest deadlines I've ever seen in my career (leading to work/life balance problems at times, as you will work Friday nights and weekends, when it doesn't have to be that way) and resulting in tasks being beneath what they should be for a given experience level. Extremely uninspiring work. Way too many layers of management and way too many meetings of various size circles that are completely unnecessary - there should be more small-team meetings with real purpose. Training/guidance is almost nonexistent, as everyone seems too busy to meet their workload to guide the various new people that have been brought on board. Some managers are completely unequipped to manage and are just someone you report to on paper. Budgets are tight.
Advice to Management
You need to make sure that people have work that is commiserate with their level, need to eliminate some layers, need to change the division of labor amongst the various departments within FB&O and add staffing so people have time to explain things to other people and so that people who are ambitious and want to guide their careers can do meaningful work and make substantive improvements.

Forget healthcare after retirement. My RX coverage next year was to have been $333/month premium. My drug costs $1,.00/mo,. I gave up on their healthcare plans a few years ago, but kept the rx because the coverage is excellent, but who in their right mind would pay $3,996 per year for $12.00 worth of drugs.

Many years of continuous cutbacks combined with the company being entirely driven by shareholder return and street analysis makes for a very uncertain / unstable environment. As much as they want to treat people well and live their values - those always take a backseat to the $. So, as a result, there is no benefit to speaking up, ""truth to power"" etc.... especially to middle and upper middle level leaders. Senior leaders are probably OK with candor but those below them are too concerned with their own security that they don't encourage the same candor. Many cutbacks in staff but not work.

","It is sometimes incredibly difficult and slow to get things done. Often it feels like unless you’ve been at the company for more than 10 years or so, it is a very long process to know who to go for what— and even if you are connected to the correct people early on in a project or in an idea phase, you better hope they have capacity or bandwidth or interest to help you. 

I think this is because Pfizer is so comfortable, no one leaves. Its culture is so entrenched in itself. 

This makes it hard for new comers—since basically in many functions everyone that surrounds you has 10+ years of tenure (not to mention Pfizer has a super bare minimum onboarding process).

The pay is better than most other places in town. It is about the size of a college campus, so there are always opportunities for colleagues to move around in the company. There are lots of overtime opportunities and extra committees and clubs to join. Salaried employees tend to be happier than production employees. Offices tend to be laid back and filled with positive energy. Even in production, though, the culture is all about safety in most departments.
","There are barely any windows, so it always feels like we are working in a basement. There are LOTS of petty rules, many production employees are very negative, and the uniforms/gowning can be uncomfortable to some workers. There is really nothing comforting about working in production. It is difficult to get into an office position, unless you get lucky or know the right person, even if you have a college degree.

Mon May 15 2017, Senior Director,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Great company - 14 years working with some very smart people,7,"I spent 14 years at Pfizer (even though I didn't think I would be there that long), and here are the things I really liked:
- very smart people, some of the best I've met in the industry; very committed to bringing cures to market
- a global footprint that helps you understand how one makes and sells medicines across the world (so some very strong global exposure)
- great benefits and recognition of the need for work-life balance, though work can be intense at times
- a learning environment that allows colleagues to grow themselves. It's not just a paycheck at the end of the day - growing skills and learning is what kept me happy
- commitment to compliance and ""doing right by the patient"" regardless of other drivers
- focus on diversity; the leadership team is diverse, the board is diverse, and every hiring decision is reviewed with a lens of inclusion and diversity. It's not just women and minorities, but hiring with a focus on getting different viewpoints and talents on the table
- New York City (though that's a con too - it's getting harder to commute in from the suburbs)! But the energy in the city is amazing, and I miss it.
","- lots of reorganization; we restructured almost every year from the mid-2000s onwards. Sometimes it was needed but it was also disruptive at other times. Not sure there's a way to avoid it given Wall Street pressures
- large company politics, which one will see in any large pharma. By and large, it worked out ok for me, but it may not be a place for someone who cannot maneuver in such an environment
- commuting into the city steadily got worse over the years. Perhaps it will get easier after the new tunnel and the Amtrak renovations are done.
