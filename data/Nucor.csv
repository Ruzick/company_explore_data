If you want extra PPE that goes above minimum standards they will provide it for you. I've always felt as if I'm giving the tools I need. Safety is up to the individual, and they provide you the tools but its up to you to use them.

Management understands that you're working to provide for your family, and if family emergencies occur they will work with you to find accommodations.
","Production based pay at a facility where production has a defined cap. Drops in production result in a drop in your pay (per hour) regardless if you were a contributing factor to the decrease in production.

Benefits package is lacking compared to other big corporations in the area.
Advice to Management
Change bonus structure to safety rather than the current production bonus. The bonus incentives that everyone does their job properly, however if one person makes a mistake and the production rate goes to zero it affects teammates in different units who had no impact on said mistake. 

Improving the insurance benefits to be more competitive with other corporations would be a huge benefit.

Safety is held to the highest standards. 4 days on, 4 days off schedule is good when not having to work extra. Profit sharing pays well into 401k for a good business year.
","The pay is not consistent at all, based on production bonus. When told to come in, not specifically covering a shift, you get only a third of the pay because you won't be getting paid production bonus. Nucor is growing a lot as a company, and it is turning away from placing value on its employees and turning to doing what it can to please share holders and raise the bottom dollar. Electricians are stretched extremely thin, there is no one ""on the bench"", so when one quits someone else has to shift into a different area or the rotation changes to 5 days on 3 days off 12 hour shifts if you're lucky. I came on having to do 6 on 2 off. Most people live far away so a 12 hour day takes up the whole day.
Advice to Management
If no one has told you, morale is extremely low. From the melt shop to the shipping bay. There is nothing being proactively done to make the job enjoyable, and you would be wrong to think that having a job you enjoy doesn't matter. Turn focus back to the employees, listen to them to figure out how to make the job better. This place can really be a great place to work, but under the current maintenance management we have lost too many good electricians due to poor leadership.

Company is inwardly-focused. Essentially, they only care about what’s going on within the organization. The fact that they employ 25,000+ people and still don’t respond to Glassdoor comments is evidence that the highest level of the organization doesn’t care much about what people outside the company think. 

No corporate responsibility around diversity or inclusion, so the workforce is very homogenous. They have skewed statistics to keep the company legally compliant, but majority of the organization is rooted in the Deep South and perpetuate the racist and segregated undertones of those communities.

They will play up the ROA bonus and the Profit Sharing but these added together historically barely make it to 25% on average. Most organizations offer close to this as a bonus so this is not much different. Raises are very low usually 2-3% which often times is below inflation. Across the board their benefits are below industry average. The management will blackball you if you say anything negative (even if it is the truth and can help the business) and you cannot be from the outside if you want a job as a manager or above.

Tue Mar 28 2017, Electrical Tech,"Huger, SC",Current Employee ,Great company to work for,4,"Nucor is a great company that tries to put its people first. They are focused on safety and making money. The majority of our pay comes from hourly bonuses that multiply our base rate by percentage. If you earn $15/hr and have a bonus of 200% you get an additional $30/hr added to your base pay for a total of $45/hr. Looking at the base pay of most people (at or below $18/hr) it doesn't come across as a high paying job. However most people in technical positions break $100k by October. 
People are friendly and have an interest in your personal life. It is like a big family. If you want to learn something here you can. Cross training is encouraged and people are eager to share what they know. Also shift work is 4 12 hr. days in a row followed by 4 days off. Plenty of time to pursue other interests.
","The environment is the hardest part. My Nucor plant is in the south and many days in the mill are over 100 degrees. The process is beyond filthy. If you have an aversion to dirt, grease, oil, dust, or grime of any kind don't even bother taking a tour. Just walking into the offices will get you a bit dirty!
The work is physically grueling also. Fire retardant clothing, heavy steel metatarsal boots, hard hat, ear plugs... all in a mill that produces steam and massive amounts of heat. Lots of stairs and cramped spaces to fit into and work. Ear-splitting noise means you must shout to talk to people when out in the mill. Also the schedule mentioned above is rotating between days and nights. Every other week you're subjected to a 12 hr jet lag. 
All said the good outweighs the bad. Nucor does what it can to mitigate the problems mentioned above but it's the process of steel making that is really the issue, not the company itself.
Advice to Management
I am proud to work at Nucor. Please continue to be good stewards of the environment. We're the largest recycler in North America and that's something to be proud of. If the new administration succeeds in defunding the EPA to help the bottom line of a wealthy few, I challenge Nucor to stay the course and not relax its responsibilities to the environment and the people of our community, even if it helps our bottom line. At the end of the day we must remember: we can neither eat nor breathe money.

","The bonus pay structure is highly unusual for any plant type job. The pay is just under other major employers in the area, but 3/4 of it is production bonus, which means that other plant jobs in the area pay slightly higher day to day, and they enjoy a genuine annual bonus, usually amounting in the thousands of dollars. Our last profit sharing check was just over five hundred, kinda disappointing. Vacation pay is a percentage of normal pay, which discourages people from using it. If the plant stops producing for any reason, employees receive base pay (twelve to thirteen dollars per hour is average for most persons working in operations, environmental, and maintenance). We have been on base pay for a week now due to underengineering of a process component (beyond our control) with no definite date of restarting production. This has caused many of our people to begin seeking other employment opportunities at local plants such as Motiva, Marathon, Occidental, Mosiac, Exxon, Shell, Methanex, and many others in the immediate vicinity.

I understand this is how Nucor has done things pretty much always, but this is not a steel mill. When this plant breaks down, it is usually for at minimum a week, usually longer. Speaking as a concerned employee who thought he would retire with Nucor but has began seeking employment elsewhere, the bonus and the pay are not as great as is touted during the hiring process or at the employee meetings. I implore the management to research the other plants in the area and arrive at this conclusion for themselves. If something doesn't change (which seems very likely since management is unreasonably stubborn on the point of the bonus structure) this plant will most likely become a contract-run facility with little or no Nucor teammates remaining.

Sat Jul 26 2014,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Could have been better,8,"Production workers paid very well and because of some the remote locations could be a good job for office and supporting staff also. In some cases it is the one of the few or only major employer to make a decent wage.
","The company feels they are the best thing there is and expects all from their employees making work your life. Benefits are mediocre. Pay even with the bonus figured in is very low for highly skilled and back office staff. Backstabbing is common and being in the wrong clique will likely mean no advancement. 

When doing research be aware that most of the information is based on Ken Iverson's Nucor. That Nucor no longer exists. Open communication is gone, employee empowerment is fading quickly. The new management being put in place are more concerned about their next advancement than taking care of the employees under them. You can see this by their increase in employee turn-over especially in non-production positions.

Read ""Plain Talk"" and understand the principles and values that made Nucor great can still be used in today's world. Following along the path because other companies of the same size do it that way is going to lead to Nucor's ruin. They'll be just like any other company and will likely get bought out by a larger company needing to diversify in to Nucor's market. ArcelorMittal comes to mind.

Fri Jun 06 2014, Electrical Maintenance,"Blytheville, AR",Current Employee ,It's got its ups and downs,4,"The variety of job activities is interesting. You'll never have the same day twice. Boredom is not something that will occur while you're working. Shift work can be nice, depending on the schedule. 4 days on, 4 days off isn't too shabby. The pay is good, if you're production. The pay is decent if you're a skilled trade. Most of the people on the floor are good to work with, attitudes towards each other are good.
","The pay isn't great if you're a skilled trade. The 4 on/ 4 off schedule doesn't include any extra days you may be randomly assigned to work. It also only occurs when manning is full for that position, which based on the first con can be a rare occurrence. There are definite instances of favoritism among advancement opportunities. The locations of a majority of the divisions is not good. Most people commute an hour each way to get away from the location the mill is built in. Vacation policy is poor, 2 weeks for ten years, then a third week until 15 years. Medical insurance is good if you're really sick, or really healthy. Co-pay is high (30%) although the premiums are fairly low.

","No real vacation. Many people have had vacation either go uncovered or forced upon others and resulting in cancelled plans. 
Mediocre health plan.
Management does not appear to want honest open feedback and communication.
Modifications or trying new things are limited to what does not hold up production. I have seen one person research and do a lot of leg work for top of the line and safe modifications to be made but they were told no, not because of money or because of safety concerns, but because they(management) did not like the idea. 
Too many political games when it comes to promotions. Good ol' boys club often wins out over the more qualified individual. 
Lean manning makes vacation and time off a significant hassle.
No room to grow due to poor manning, many employees have quit over the past two to three years.
Poor supervisory team has led to a disgruntled team that is performing at less than they are capable.
You will be told the company wants open honest feedback but anyone that attempts to provide it, whether tactfully or not, is viewed as having a bad attitude or not being a team player.

","Most managers and supervisors there in seattle hold old culture (good ol day mills) , not real Nucor culture that I've read or been talked about from other visiting Nucor EE's. A couple of managers there need to retire or be evaluated for a forced retirement. I had been employed with the company for almost 5 years. Within that time I had nothing but a clean track record and provided them with top notch work you'd expect from a high paying employer. I see a new wave of employees moving in that make me believe on day they'll be caught up with the rest of corporation, wich is a some what of a relieving perception I guess. I wish corporate would listen and react accordingly to there mandatory employee surveys we fill out annually, I personally believe it make a great difference within. They will pound safety in your head but at the same time throw you in situations that are highly hazardous to your health and well being just to turn there back and hope for the best. Ask anyone employed within the shipping department on how dangerous there scrap problem was and is. Thousands of tons of scrap intertwined with finished product and common walk ways ( not designated for this purpose ). It hasnt always been a problem, its just had managements blind eye turned from the issue because it became out of control within the last few years. The managers that hold true concern lie frustrated and concerned but than again are out numbered in Seattle. Its really sad to me cause I left a place I may have been able to stick around and help change things. Seattle has great potential and I see that. I met many great people I will always stay in contact with forever. The straw that broke the camels back for me was being denied a job within for purposes that were bias. Had nothing to do with my work ethic. I was the only person who submitted a bid on the job and my bid sheet went straight in the garbage with no consideration. Be careful when applying. Most people dont mind working around some of there fixable safety issues. The proof is in the pudding, I left a job that payed me 80k a year with no back up plan. Money became less important to me, I was loosing my mind seeing all of there neglect. Its a game of favorites within Seattles walls and not all favorites have pure intentions. If your in a position to relocate I highly recommend applying with Nucor, Just not Seattle.
 
my only major regret is leaving without trying to contribute to a more positive changes and to stand up for what is right. Then again I still have whats most important to me, a kind, loving, and understanding family whom stand up and support my decision.
