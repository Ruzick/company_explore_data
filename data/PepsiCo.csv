Sat Jan 16 2021, Supply Chain Associate,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Not Great, but not bad",0,"Company looks great on a Resume.
Generally speaking, the job is very secure.
","Company does not seem to value employees as much as competitors. They will continually tell you how much they appreciate your work and how valuable you are, but will not let that reflect in how they treat you. Salaries in corporate positions are below many of their competitors. Employee benefits again are below average compared to competition. Only provide an effective 2% 401K match which is laughable. 

Overall the company is not concerned with making you feel welcome or happy in your position. People are not very welcoming in my experience, and actually were often quite cold and uninviting.

A lot of options for career direction but limited options for career progression. Working your way up will take quite some time.

Tue Oct 27 2020, Merchandiser,"Orlando, FL",Current Employee ,Good Side Job,2,"For a part time job, being a small format merchandiser pays very well. I work 2 days a week and get paid just under 300 weekly although that includes mileage compensation. You talk to few people over the course of a day and can just listen to music or podcasts your whole shift. This is a fantastic job for someone who is in school or is looking for a 2nd job on the weekends and isn't afraid to put in a little work.
","2 days is the most days a week I can work before having to work larger stores like big grocery stores. The job is physical and requires at least in my case often using a U-boat with one or several broken wheels. The biggest con is some days if you are needed on another route if someone called off you will be notified morning of, which can be very frustrating if they dont tell you until you are already half way to your route that is AN HOUR away or sometimes already there. They also only compensate mileage that was driven AFTER your first store so the drive to your route is not covered.
Advice to Management
The late notification thing isn't really anything that can be done about since people call out last minute all the time so I guess no advice.

","I had only been at PepsiCo for a short time and within the first few weeks, had unfortunately contracted a flu. I had been attending all meets, had been heavily engaged in training, and had started working on projects within the first two weeks while completing tasks. I had come into the office while having a flu, as I had still been new to the company and had not had sick time built up and I did not want to jeopardize my new job. I expressed that I had a doctor's note and that I would want to stay present with my kid for one day as they also had flu symptoms, in case I needed to rush to the Pediatrician. I inquired on working from home during that day so I could still get work done and be able to rush out, if needed on an emergency basis...I had been told by my supervisor that ""WFH is not to be used a child care"", even though I had childcare arranged for my kid at that point, but simply offered to work from home that day so that I could still be present, if the flu became worse, while I had a fever as well. I had been fired after the same supervisor expressed, in a private meeting, that he didn't think I could meet the responsibilities of the job 'as a single parent"".

Because moving hardworking teams to India and Mexico, and asking US teams to train their replacements, no less (the absolute audacity) is definitely the epitome of efficient...

","The long hours. Be ready to work 12 plus hours a day. This is NOT a sales job. You will be expected to merchandise all your accounts. Get ready to be moving products into nasty coolers and build displays. Your territory will be unreasonably large. While that sounds nice for money, you are unable to do your job to the proper standards due to time constraints. The Coke reps had merchandisers and less than half the accounts I did. No matter how well you do, you'll be passed over by a campus hire. The campus program makes promises to recent graduates and promotes them regardless of skill or qualifications. There is literally no incentive for them to perform. So in addition to doing extremely physical work, with long hours away from your family you'll have nothing to show for it. Oh and who can forget early morning safety meetings where managers ask you to sign off on training you never were given. You'll start your day behind and still be expected to finish on time to avoid them having to pay you overtime.
Advice to Management
Promote based on skill and qualification. Not on campus program. Hire merchandisers to take pressure off the sales people. Hire additional sales reps. Our territories are unreasonably large. Actually give safety training instead of forcing us to say we got it. Give a better work life balance.

","The biggest problem is believing a guy who has only worked for the company for a couple of months over someone who has been working there for years. When evidence of a delivery driver not doing their job is presented, the sales person ends up getting in trouble for the driver not doing their job. They do not stand up for their employees when upper management brings up a possible issue where there is no evidence of an issues. All problems role down hill onto people who did not make the problem in the first place. Putting constant blame on others instead of making the person who cause the problem be held accountable.
Advice to Management
Believe your employees who have been there longer over someone who has only been with the company for a month. Believe your employee who has been there for years over an employee who has lied and been caught lying about their work. Stop blaming people for problems that they didn't do. 
There is almost no chance of a delivery driver moving into a sales position due to the Upper Management wanting to hire college graduates from outside the company who has no experience.

Tue Apr 14 2020, Merchandiser,"Toledo, OH",Current Employee ,Core themes relating to this job title people should know. 2020 review for Merchandising,1,"1) Flexibility (100% as part-time only)

2) Operate independently without over-the-shoulder micro-management. 
However, employees should expect frequent audits

3) A promising Labor Union

4) Paid mileage and miles are tax deductible for the end of the year

5) Character and communication building skills

6) Wonderful work opportunities for entrepreneurs of any age who view 
this job as a stepping stone. What i mean is, this position allows 
employees to take an insider look at how clients run their businesses 
(sales, marketing, design, ethics, seasonal dynamics, human relations, etc.).
","From over ""5"" years experience...
 
1) Communication – Waiting hours, days, weeks or even months to hear back if at all for issues relating to safety and procedure. HR is 99% a ghost and management simply don't care.

2) Corporate mindset – Not valued. You’re at the bottom of the barrel and 
never a priority. This company will never defend you in favor of money. When you get together in groups with management to discuss potential issues within the job, their hidden agenda is to take into account what people are saying so they can build a defense against it. Management does this because they have to follow protocol and no action will be taken on account that they know it won't make the company money. 

3) Bad Contract – “5” Years to reach top-out pay for full-timers.

4) Dishonesty – Management will deliberately with-hold information, 
manipulate and mislead employees to save the company money.

5) Over-worked and underpaid – Don’t expect any help even with Holidays, 
because it’s a one-man-army out there where hours are watched very 
closely. Management will take you off the clock if you're near OT and dock 
you for lunches that you don't take on your paycheck. Correcting this 
takes weeks and you're auto-enrolled into 401k plans without consent. 

6) False image bearing – Falsely claims “safety” and “professionalism” as a 
first priority just to be seen and heard by others with no sincerity. Be 
prepared to use broken equipment, faced with unsafe work environments, 
threatened into compliance by both management and clientele even if 
duties go beyond the scope of work responsibilities as stated in the 
contract, and screwed over by co-workers consistently with no 
accountability so the work compounds for the average 10+ hour shift. 
Extremely unprofessional and selfish company. Nothing like the orientation process delivered what so ever. Their all about pushing the Image.

7) PepsiCo expects speed, quality and pride from their associates. However, you cannot take pride in what you do or do a quality job because management wants you to ""keep moving"", which means you're basically a punching bag for clientele, PepsiCo sales reps and PepsiCo management without ever having a chance to defend yourself because the work wasn't finished or performed correctly. And when you do defend yourself, you are reprimanded, corrected and taken off the route for a new one, which hurts income. So you just have to accept the abuse or quit, hence, high turn-over rates are there for a reason. 

8) PepsiCo picks up anybody off the street. So when your co-workers don't 
do their job, the bottom line gets hit again and again with newly 
implemented rules that must be followed immediately and occasionally 
forced to work other peoples stores on top of their own or you're 
threatened. This should be a reflection of the hiring manager, but 
management takes 0 responsibility 100% of the time so former employees must adapt immediately.

9) Part-time/ casuals receive no Holiday pay, ETO, Benefits or Overtime and 
are kept around 20 hours weekly.

10) Extra’s – Bad moral where 99% hate their jobs and gossip about their own company/ associates, high turn-over rates, no fixed routes so adapting to a formula for efficiency doesn’t work for the dynamics of this position, no 
Pepsi merchandise discounts and potential work-related injuries/ medical 
treatment for your back and high anxiety levels. Count on fighting this company every step of the way for any and every discrepancy. You're liable to have a heart attack before you retire.

11) Unfortunately... most jobs are this way. And this is to be accepted. Good luck to everyone who accepts this position.

Everyone is always looking to make things work better and solve problems.
","HR here is very difficult to work with. Any time it comes to compensation or promotions, the company tries to have as little interaction with the employee as possible. You are essentially told your salary with no room to negotiate.

Rules are put into place to keep you at a role for certain periods of time however, these rules are unevenly enforced and allow certain people to advance faster than others.
Advice to Management
When I first joined Pepsi, I was extended an offer and was low-balled. I had received close to Christmas time. When I decided to counteroffer, HR came back to me and told me that there were too many people out for the holidays and that I would not be able to negotiate my salary. Having no other options at the time, I took the offer I was given.

While in the company, I found that employees that were extended offers through the intern program (a program that I was not a part of) were given roughly $10k more for the same position than what ""external hires"" were extended. I routinely pointed out this inequity to HR and was ignored or told that the salary I was getting was competitive with market rates. 

After spending 18 months in a role, an employee has the opportunity to move to a new role. However, this rule was broken frequently based on the circumstances but it's based on how willing the manager is to fight for you regardless of your qualifications. Once again, the company shows it's inequity.

The company has really talented, passionate people. The culture of the company is fun and supportive. But there is so much arbitrary inequity in pay and opportunity that drives people away. As a result, it is very difficult to stay motivated.

Advice to Management
To start, be upfront about business needs and potentially long hours. The aim should be to retain workers who are content with all realistic expectations, even if it means scaring other candidates off.

Finally, incorporate a formal training process. Current training consists of shadowing for six hours, and then they're on their own to strikeout. Give new hires one designated mentor for the first week to help build confidence through hands-on practice and guidance. Having one teacher will help to keep new hires from becoming overwhelmed since everybody has their way of doing things. It's easy for some trainees to feel like they're doing nothing right sometimes because of this, even if they have made notable improvements. Throughout the second week, touch base on factors such as what the trainees can improve on and what they've done well.

In conclusion, don't tell candidates to expect consistent eight hour nights if that isn't realistic, and make the first two weeks on the job manageable and controlled. Aim to retain with honesty and attentiveness.

Wed Aug 28 2019, Operator,,Current Employee ,Unfairness and inequality when it comes to working hours,0,"First of all I have to say I'm a proud Pepsi employee and have been with the company for some time.They offer medical benefits,401k,pension,short term and long term disability.Time off to take care of urgent family emergencies and opportunity to advance up the ranks.The company offers a certain level of job security that some companies may not be able to do.
","What determines if Pepsi gets a good or bad review from an employee is the local management.If the managers treat all the employees with fairness and equality it creates a better working environment for the overall benefit of not only the employees but the company as a whole.But i have noticed a trend that is very disturbing not only to me but fellow employees as well.The company says it treats all of it's employees with fairness and equality.This is not the case when it comes to our working hours.Our first shift counter parts get all of their 40+hrs but when it comes to 2nd shift,we get shorted on our hours every so often even if we have enough work to get our 40 hrs. This is something that has been going on for at least the past 15 yrs.It does not happen every week but it happens often enough for me to write this review.We the 2nd shift run most of the product yet 1st shift gets the extra hours and we get our hours cut.So in a manner of speaking it we are the step child and it does not matter how much good we do we are still treated like the step child. There were times when I had to withdraw money for my 401 so I can have enough money in my checking account to pay my bills.
Advice to Management
Treat all of your employees fairly and equally especially when it comes to our working hours.We come in and give 110% on our shift and that is the gratitude you show!

The company is ran on a skeleton crew. You’ll do the work of 2-3 people in other companies. You’ll work nights, weekends, and holidays. Your support network is overloaded also. You will ask for the same thing to be done usually 4 times. You’ll be frustrated and look incompetent because of this.

Absolutely no work/life balance because operations can never stay on schedule due to poor machine reliability and maintenance, thus weekend operations are always certain.
Advice to Management
Support your supervisors, follow your own rules, lead with purpose, be intentional and direct (don't talk in circles), lead courageous conversations with union workforce, and BELIEVE your supervisors when they have real concerns.
