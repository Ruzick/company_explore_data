Dependent on management, company objectives trickle down to lower level employees in bad ways or good ways. There is a way to balance sales goals with positive reinforcement, unfortunately management is quick to threaten although politely to write ups.

Instead they watch hour long ted talks and could care less about applying good communication skills to speak and handle employees.

","Slow to get products to market and is complex for customers to consume.
There is a lot of middle management, who are incompetent. There is a lot of executive folks that are clueless and have moved up, on account of having connections. 
If you are competent, then job satisfaction here can be a problem. Not everyone pulls their weight around. What is the point of keeping a director employed, when all they do is to manage up and then fire their report(the one who gets the job done). The person does not even take any initiative to look at new products in the market, even when spoon fed. They are probably drawing over $200K/Year. Many many such instances, when you look all around. There is less scope for growth and have seen smart people leave for other firms. The constant round of restructuring is no good either.
The number of vacation days is dismal and unused vacation cannot be carried over.
Advice to Management
Find people that are go-getters. Stop promoting clueless people, because they have been in the firm for 20 years or brown nose the VPs. Get rid off people that do not keep up with the solutions/skills in the market. The market transitions faster than the company can move. Some people are just not cut for it, no matter how hard you try with skills transformation. Empower people who can get things done. Bring, fresh new blood from outside, who are a good fit for the role by their accomplishments.

I left to chase the money and work for a smaller company, and even though it was a solid experience - I regretted stepping away. I just rejoined AT&T for a second run and I will say that I came back for a reason. 

- Solid benefits, discounts, and perks in comparison to other companies.
- Extensive amount of training, development programs, and opportunity for career progression. 
- Competitive pay, very organized, big on diversity, and you know what is expected of you.
","The downsides that influenced me to step away the first time...

- Competitive pay - but not the BEST pay. Especially, if you work your way up promoting internally. It was tough for me to get them to bump my pay to be on par with others in our industry. However, I can say that they brought me BACK at what I was looking to get before I left... So, I am not sure how that works but that was a challenge my first time around. Shouldn't be an issue if you're a external candidate. 
- It is a BIG company. Sometimes it is hard to make a big wave when you're a small fish swimming in the ocean. Being a big company isn't always a bad thing though (see above regarding organization and benefits).

","Overhyped by recruiters as world-class sales training. In reality, the training is very product-focused. Large portfolios of products to sell and you're expected to sell across multiple, which makes it hard to be an expert in anything. Quotas were unevenly set from MTM, ex. someone in month 2 of the program would have a higher quota in their second month than someone in month 3 had in their second month. At the end of the program, you're expected to hit at least 75% YTD attainment to get placed in the field and if you have a bad first or second month, it's next to impossible to achieve that.

Wed Jan 13 2021, Network Supervisor,"Redwood City, CA",Former Employee ,Good salary but extremely demanding,0,"Rapidly changing environment means that your day to day activities are not routine. You get to meet a lot of people inside and outside the company. 
Objectives are laid annually and with very minimal supervision above you, so how you accomplish your overall objectives really comes down to you. 
Depending on your performance, bonuses, and region, the pay can be absurdly high for this position. 
Employee discounts add up fast if you use AT&T services. 
Further education programs are there and liberally offered if you are interested in taking that approach. 
You get a company car to drive around in, saving a lot of costs on your own vehicle.
You're part of an organization that is doing something that has a large impact on the consumers you serve.
","You need to have very strong communication and interpersonal skills to succeed, especially since you will be working with customers directly and a union-represented workforce (in non-right to work states). 

The job is demanding in every possible way and you will be asked to do things you may have little experience or exposure with to accomplish a task.
If you want to succeed in the measured metrics, you will have to put in a lot of work, especially if your colleagues do not share the same mindset to help you. Expect to log into your computer on your day off or handle escalations while out with family. Average work week is about 50-60hrs not including the time you'll put in ""after-hours.""

A lot of escalations, there is a heavy reliance on this position to get things done from many departments, sometimes you will be asked to oversee the entire process with other work-groups.
A lot of moving targets and flavor of the months/quarter when it comes to what is mission critical.
Merit-based promotions will only get you so far, expect to play corporate politics if you want to move further up from this corner of the business.
Training for this position comes in the form of asking more senior peers for assistance and guidance.

Company has great benefits and pay. Financially very rewarding. Job can be fun and co workers are typically great except management. Most of the time the best part of there was when management was on vacation and you actually felt like you could do your job without being ruled over.
Cons
work and home life is terrible. They don't work around your schedule very well. Very difficult to take off unless you request a month out or more but even then might be denied due to sonority of other workers. Manager is not there to really help you but to make sure they reach there agenda. Company constantly talks about great ethics and doing the right thing but most of the time is not the case.

The money is good, and there is room to move up in the company. you also get great discounts on all their products and some services if you have them.
Cons
The downside, is that there is no work life balance for people starting out. It takes time to actually get a favorable schedule. 
You also have to bid for scheduling and time off. Its no the best system. 

I believe att needs to hire more store managers with degrees vs just promoting people in the company with just numbers. As a worker you can tell the difference. There is sometimes alot of showing favor to certain reps over other ones. It can be a toxic work place.

Thu Jan 07 2021, B2B Sales Representative,"Irving, TX",Current Employee ,TERRIBLE Program - Do NOT Join! Don't waste your time here.,1,"- Mediocre pay if you have previous sales/cold calling experience
- Supportive colleagues that will be there for you during tough times
","- B2B Program each month has TOO many new hires which makes it hard for Sales Managers, Directors, and Technical Consultants to manage. A lot of the time, you'll be left waiting for an answer for HOURS, even left on read. Lots of impatience and unwillingness to help new hires that have VALID questions. 
- They ask that you meet 75% of your YEAR-TO-DATE (YTD) Quota during your 4-5 month stay. If you are falling short at all, you WILL be asked to leave the program. They don't fire you because they don't want to pay you unemployment, but phrase it as a way for you to be 're-hirable with AT&T in the future'. But you WILL BE FORCED TO QUIT UNLESS YOU ARE ABOVE 75% YEAR-TO-DATE.
- Placement requirements for Full-Time Roles are INCONSISTENT. Lots of inconsistent guidelines and rules. Some people will be placement eligible BELOW 75% because their 'sales managers fought for them since they are GREAT reps'. Others, who have worked hard to earn over 75%, may not be placement eligible if an Order Number for a sale has not yet been processed - which is ultimately the SYSTEM'S error, not the sales rep's fault. 
- ORDER NUMBERS can take 1-2 MONTHS TO SHOW UP. This is a flawed system because it not only messes with your Month-to-Date sales number, but it also affects your Year-to-Date Attainment which is CRITICAL for placement eligibility. You may sell something in October that you will not get credit for until December. Absolutely flawed system in place that is setting you up for FAILURE.
- Very unethical training methods in place. Management will get on a call with you and 'coach' you, to the point where it is borderline VERBAL HARASSMENT. 
- Technical consultants, who are supposed to be there to answer any technical questions you may have, are very snappy and short with you. I think they can be smart and helpful otherwise, but there are way too many sales reps that are asking them questions. This leaves them impatient and UNWILLING to help you. They will turn you away and tell you to figure it out on your own. 
- Let's say you make over 75% YTD Attainment and you get placed in a Full-Time role. Guess what? You have to sign a contract that binds you to stay in the position for 18 MONTHS. If you leave anytime before, you will be asked to pay back $13,000.
- When you're chosen to pick a location and role for placement, you are given FIVE minutes to choose in a Webex call. If you are 1 minute late to the call, you are given FOUR minutes. You are not given preferable locations to choose from. You can only lock in a certain region in the U.S., and from there, you pick a state and role based on THEIR availability. 
- During month 3, you will begin receiving inbound calls from Small Business customers. You're practically working a call center job where you are fixing billing issues, customer service issues, and trying to up-sell Small Business owners that are simply calling in to renew their existing service. Management will listen to these calls and send you lengthy e-mails on what you did wrong, word by word.
- Management will lie to you to keep you happy. They will lie that you are PROMISED placement, that they are ACTIVELY working on an issue for you, that you are SAFE to stay in the program, that SOMEONE ELSE is responsible for handling this problem but when you go to that SOMEONE ELSE, they don't have the authority to make any changes... Absolutely inefficient and irresponsible behavior as management of a leading telecommunications business.
- Micromanagement all around. In a real corporate job, you don't need TWO check-ins a day. They treat you like babies because you are new grads and helicopter over you.
- If you are given another job offer, please take the latter. AT&T sounds like a great opportunity because of its name and reputable sales program, but you will ultimately waste your time if you end up getting CUT. The moment you begin this role, you will spend your days worrying about your job security. A lot of cold-calling is LUCK. Someone can make 100+ cold calls/emails a day with NO RESULTS. It will mess with your mental well-being.

","Look on LinkedIn people don’t last in this job more than 1-2 years. You can hit quota for months. Once you hit a cold streak you could potentially be fired depending on your manager. Yes depending on you’re manager you could be unemployed during the pandemic or holidays. Managers encourage unethical behavior that negatively impacts the company. Some managers are so unqualified you question how they got into management. Since AT&T is so large it has became largely disorganized and the people who get promoted into management have special connections or followed the track of unethically behavior. This work environment depending on your VP can be toxic. VPs are extremely out of touch with what’s actually going on. Every manager is encouraging there team to do whatever it takes not to be apart of the next round of cuts. Sadly they have a funnel of college kids ready to come in whenever someone quits. So management never really learns why the turnover rate is so high.

Advice to Management
Customer has too much power over reps trying to help. Att has allowed the customer so much free they refuse to pay for service. Outside factors like System issues, upset about hold times are counted against you if the customer complains on surveys. The customers feel entitled and the resources to make them happy are not available. Upper management (not supervisors ) poorly prepares rep for changes. I often rely on common sense until required procedures are updated and hope they fall in line with the procedures to avoid violations. My metrics shouldn’t be affected by att lack of preparation for things like football games. Mandatory overtime is one thing but Last minute mandatory overtime during the holidays is disrespectful

Cons
Managers are shady and want their reps to do shady things to get sales. Also no matter how well you do, double your quota or whatever, they still micromanage you and never appreciate anything. For this reason top sellers are constantly leaving for companies that will appreciate them more and At&t gets stuck with low performers as most of their workforce. Also you are given discipline points when you are sick and forced to call out. No matter how serious it is or if it’s an emergency

","For me the cons are in the leadership. Managers and Directors, at least in sales, do really seem to want to use intimidation tactics and promote a culture that relies on it. As a seller it makes you feel a lot of bad pressure. It really does seem like all of your value is in how close you are to hitting your quota. The job doesn't make you feel happy for doing a good job, you just feel relief when you get close enough to quota so management will just leave you alone and you don't have to worry about being fired for that month.
Advice to Management
I really do think that AT&T could be a better place to work if HR was more readily available. I had multiple times where I tried to get in touch with HR contacts and they just never responded. Managers and upper level management could also be more understanding and lead people instead of just telling them what to do. AT&T also has this mentality with sales positions that the only way to get to a new role is to be really successful in sales. So if you could be an asset to AT&T in a different department but you aren't excelling at sales, they will not even give you a chance. You'll get fired before they try to put you in a position that is a better fit for your skills.
