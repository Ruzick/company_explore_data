","I have never seen more nepotism or cliques among the high executives in my life. Management is a joke. Never once had a formal review. I never even learned what their vision is. Maybe their motto it try their best to twist everything to their advantage. Retaliation is served to all employees that dare open their mouth like sweet candy. They prefer to pay for their private jet for the high rank people than spend money in better systems for higher productivity. Basically work with what you get and don't say a word. The lack of respect for their vendors is mind blowing. Not to mention that they shush everything under the rug like nothing ever happened. It basically feels like going back in time.

Wed Aug 30 2017, Accounts Payable Specialist,"Denver, CO",Former Employee ,One of the most difficult companies I've ever worked for.,3,"Flexible hours and decent benefits. Mid-level Managers supported promotion within.
","Most of the people were wonderful to work with but there were some difficult co-workers and supervisors who created a very toxic work environment. Gossip, back stabbing, lies and passive aggressive behavior to just name a few issues. Some of this behavior came from the supervisors too. Some of the Mid-level Managers tried to address these issues but the offenders often complained to HR when they were confronted for their behavior. HR tended to side with the aggressors. 

Work load was not evenly or fairly distributed. Many of the more competent employees were stuck with the burden of doing much of their co-workers work, causing a lot of stress and burn out. When supervisors received complaints about workload, they usually disregarded or ignored it until the person had a full meltdown or simply left. 

AP was also treated as an inferior dept within the company. For example, the budget for team & morale building events were severely reduced to the point that the Managers had to fund some events using their own money. Budgets for other depts did not seem to be effected. Hard not to feel disgruntle when other depts are going out to expensive dinners and golfing while AP is gets a potluck that they paid for out of their own pocket. Also, most of the other depts were allowed to wear casual dress, including jeans, while AP had to dress business style. I believe this has since changed, but it still caused a very low morale when it was happening.

","Upper management in Tulsa is entirely disconnected from the Denver office. Leadership doesn't make regular visits to Denver which speaks volumes for how they look at these employees. The company is unable to set thoughtful policies for an organization of its size and when it does it fails to give the mid-level managers a heads up to provide feedback on the proposed policy. Bad behavior is allowed if the department is a money maker which is totally disheartening to those that have to work with the offenders.

Sat Aug 29 2015, SWD Facility Manager,"Bakken, Aust-Agder",Current Employee ,I work with a great crew and enjoy the day-to-day challenges my position provides.,0,"I work with a great, family-like work crew. HR is amazing and always there to help. Everyday is a learning experience and I enjoy my daily dealings and relations with our customers. The benefits are great. I appreciate the high-quality safety program/training available to employees.
","This company is focused more on expanding their operations and less on ""taking care"" of the hard-working, ""lower-tier"" employees that keep things moving forward. Trying to get straight-forward answers for customers, from upper management, is an uphill battle. There is very little recognition for those that give their all at work. There are no performance bonuses or incentives for employee morale, as well as per diem for workers that travel far from home. When small equipment issues/repairs come up, you have to wait for approval. I do understand that. However, after weeks of waiting, you'll finally get a vague answer and the original problem has become multiple issues.
Advice to Management
I would like to see a more organized chain of command. It would be nice to be able to access higher management to discuss matters that the lower management ""doesn't have time for"". It would be more efficient to be able to get the needed answers and professional opinions at a much quicker pace. There are too many customers/companies that need prompt answers and I can't provide the answers when I can't get straight-forward answers for myself. That has put me in a few tough situations without resolve. Take care of the ""lower-tier"" employees. They're the ones getting dirty and putting in those long days to keep us in business.
