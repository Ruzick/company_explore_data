Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at Nationwide full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
I have loved the flexibility on dealing with the pandemic, making sure things were least disruptive as possible. Competitive pay, (depending on the department). Encouraging of receiving feedback for improvement, open door policy, great relocation options when needed. Overall, been a great experience and hope to retire here. For those that were impacted by job eliminations, significant advance notice was given with a gratuitous compensation package, and resources to find another role within the organization, and outside the organization.
Cons
Benefit options have declined over the past few years with additional cost, and less options. Work life balance is a struggle in my division. Almost everyone I work with directly or indirectly put's in well more than their normal workday hours to meet demand. This use to be less frequent, but with the lack of resources, it has become more common than not to put in extra hours to meet service level, and demand.
Advice to Management
Encourage employees to not work significant additional hours. Some things will not get done, but it would be the only way to expose that additional resources are needed instead of potentially burning out associates.

","Role is highly micromanaged, monotonous
Advice to Management
I know the role requires accountability and integrity and perhaps it is why micromanagement is passed down from director to manager to supervisor but it’s a tough environment to work in. Expectations and standards are high but non stop calling and taking calls while also expecting to complete all other tasks, and adhere to a schedule that is hard to control, but nearly impossible to update in system, then it shouldn’t be a metric. Place more emphasis on metrics then on just letting employees get their jobs done and provide good service and relationships with members. They can measure every single move you make which causes a lot of pressure to be perfect. Makes it challenging to always meet and exceed expectations when you feel like you’re under a constant microscope. Just thought I’d be helping people and selling but as I said, seem to care more about the metrics. Which can feel overwhelming and constraining but I get they have certain numbers to hit and it’s how their success is determined. They look at how much you sell a month and you need to speak to 8 people a day, which can take 50 calls and voicemails, you answer emails, chats, and complete several other tasks all while also taking inbounds and having no more than 2 minutes between calls. If there are inbound emails, they want you to finish in 5-7 minutes. Be prepared to screen share and have them listening in on calls. Quality department will also rate calls and you have to follow a call flow. Training is good and they do help if you need it but it is high pressure and fast paced and it can be mentally fatiguing. If you’re only 1 minute late, even from lunch or break, you get verbals. I haven’t been in call centers much but if you’re used to that, just know there are codes you go into to not get calls, but they monitor them heavily. They do ask for feedback so managers, please keep asking for feedback. The only bad thing is some feedback they will say there’s nothing they can do or will do. Sometimes there are system issues that make it challenging to sell but IT is responsive. Overall, great bosses and team mates, members are mostly in good spirits except during a pandemic, occasional rude customer but far and few in between. Call center work is hard for management to make it feel less routine and boring but they try. Retention basically does it all, we service and sell. Which can be rewarding but also what makes it hard because it’s a lot of multi tasking and you keep having to switch your hat. This was also my review but I’d say to management, I know there are reasons to essentially spy on employees but it makes it an overbearing environment. Also needing to make non stop phone calls, accept phone calls, wde emails, awds, regular emails, meetings, I drives, training, and complicated customer issues and also hit all metrics and exceed them just to try and get a better schedule or recognition, when it’s hard enough just to meet them...it can feel like we are expected to be machines or robo callers. Sometimes it’s going to take more time to notate or complete a task or work on policies or complex issues. It’s hard feeling like your every move is being watched or that you can get warnings or write ups for not meeting metrics when stuff comes up everyday. For people applying, if you have a hard time in fast paced environments, time management or multi tasking, this will be a challenge. Overall wonderful though and truly a great company that really cares. Working from home during Covid really made me feel safe. It’s a good opportunity and I will say, management is willing to listen so that can take you far.

Which can be rewarding but also what makes it hard because it’s a lot of multi tasking and you keep having to switch your hat. This was also my review but I’d say to management, I know there are reasons to essentially spy on employees but it makes it an overbearing environment. Also needing to make non stop phone calls, accept phone calls, wde emails, awds, regular emails, meetings, I drives, training, and complicated customer issues and also hit all metrics and exceed them just to try and get a better schedule or recognition, when it’s hard enough just to meet them...it can feel like we are expected to be machines or robo callers. Sometimes it’s going to take more time to notate or complete a task or work on policies or complex issues. It’s hard feeling like your every move is being watched or that you can get warnings or write ups for not meeting metrics when stuff comes up everyday. For people applying, if you have a hard time in fast paced environments, time management or multi tasking, this will be a challenge. Overall wonderful though and truly a great company that really cares. Working from home during Covid really made me feel safe. It’s a good opportunity and I will say, management is willing to listen so that can take you far.

","I worked at NW for several years. Prior to 2020, it was a pretty good place to work. Beginning in 2020, senior management in OH began making sweeping changes to QA (change is ok! However, we were being evaluated on brand new rules retroactively. So how could you possibly get a good score when you didn’t know what the rule was, three months prior?) and also installed spyware on our laptops (they can see keystrokes, record the screen, mouse movement, etc). I could go on and on about the issues I saw. But to keep it short, I’ve worked for other carriers and NW is the only one who made me and my peers feel like they don’t care about us as human beings and only as robots to save them money by clicking the right checkboxes on the screen in the right order. Also felt like they stopped actually caring about customer service which is hilarious
Advice to Management
Your spyware on employee’s computers just shows us that you don’t trust your fellow human beings and it fails to instill your company values and severely lowers morale to the point of almost guaranteed attrition (unless that was your goal all along?)

Your QA department is a joke and it feels like you’ve purposefully set it up so that previously productive and high quality employees will feel ostracized 

Nothing you’ve done in 2020 is positive, whatsoever

","Over the last 10 years it seems layoffs have been the number one way of solving any problem. The challenge with that is that the people we let go are always the front line workers. The ""top of the house"" always keeps their jobs, and new jobs are created for them when leadership wants them moved vs letting them go. This results in a new VP of something who then builds up a completely new department. I was fortunate enough to work in Columbus.

Politics are very apparent to move up in the company. Positions are banded, not people, which often means that if you perform at a pay band above what you do, you cannot get an in place promotion. You must seek a new position to continue moving forward.

","Nationwide has a history of not asking men to pay back relocation when leaving the company before the 24 month pay back period is up, but they enforce it without consideration for women. I gave Nationwide the names of two men (of the four that exist) who they've not requested payment back from. I asked 2.5 months ago - followed up four times in writing and twice on the phone since - for an explanation of what feels to be gender discrimination. They refuse to respond which I'm accepting as admission of guilt. 
As a female, my advice would be - unless you're quite certain you'll be staying for the entire two years after relocating, kindly decline their offer to avoid the situation I've found myself in.

","Nationwide likes to think that it is a ""progressive"" employer. They are not. They use words like ""Diversity"" and ""Inclusion"" and those mottos may function for minorities but they have bigger problems than that. The company is regrettably rife with cliques, scapegoating, group-think and an ugly undercurrent of ""us vs them."" Their yearly budgeting and planning is so slipshod so as to be a roll of the dice. Because of this, they have to rely to a large degree on a huge contingent of contractors who end up being as disposable to management as paper cups. Office politics can get very ugly indeed and the younger FTEs play it as viciously as the older ones who often are disrespectful to contractors and play the badmouthing game - seemingly as a recreation. An acknowledged joke in my group was the fact that I was the 4th or 5th in an ever-changing succession of contractors. I have since had offers to interview there and will never, ever go back. Scary place.
Advice to Management
Management needs to take an unemotional look at the sheer ugliness of their toxic and morale-crushing office politics. Show some appreciation for contractors. If you are behind the curve on major internal projects - don't take it out on the people learning the ropes. Finally, toxic behavior and badmouthing should not be tolerated by even the ""old-hands"" at the company, let alone your younger FTE's because you might be surprised to find out that they might be the very ones holding back productivity and destroying morale. Wake up.

Since leadership has changed in the top positions, it has been nothing but massive lay-offs as they try to race to the bottom in a commodity price war. They are closing sites so they can gradually release employees in remote locations. They promote people who are ""yes"" people and back stabbers and lay-off those who are conscientious and continually strive to improve themselves and the company.
Advice to Management
Stop with the rhetoric about being a caring company and taking ""extraordinary care"" of the associates and the reprimand them when productivity slips after you announce pending lay-offs, then you cut 25%-27% of the jobs and tell everyone that more jobs will be cut next year because these cuts won't ""get you to your number.""

Leadership needs to stop changing directions of how work get down every time they read the back cover of the latest trendy magazine. You spent over $3M on making the organization ""LEAN"" and to adopt DevOps and Agile, only to add jobs in the process and them release those people a few years later. And now you are slashing jobs because you are not cost competitive. Maybe it's the failed leaders that should be fired.

If performance doesn’t matter, why would a top-performing FLRP stay? 

FLRP stopped recruiting at schools that FLRP alums historically attended, such as IU. Since FLRP doesn't recruit at IU anymore, the Indiana alums in FLRP now don’t want anything to do with FLRP. So this year FLRP is recruiting mediocre candidates from less competitive schools.

Sun Aug 02 2020, Management Associate FLRP MBA,"Columbus, OH",Current Employee ,The FLRP program for MBAs is deceitful,2,"- Many areas of Nationwide have work-life balance. The hours are good.
- Flexible work arrangements may be an option depending on your manager. There have been instances where Nationwide allows you to work remotely if your spouse moves for his job.
- The participants in FLRP are friendly and nice. Everyone says hello to one another. Most FLRPs try to help one another and are good colleagues.
- People from various departments and at various levels are willing to meet with you. These coffee chats are where they discuss their work. A main goal for FLRPs is to meet as many high level people as possible in the hope that they have a permanent role for you after FLRP.
","- Deceitful recruitment in the sense that the FLRP program pitches itself to MBA candidates as a leadership program for those with relevant pre-MBA career experience and a way to accelerate your career. Many MBA FLRPs seem to have more leadership responsibility in their pre-MBA career than in FLRP or immediately after if they permanently stay at Nationwide.
- FLRP was founded in 2005. 15 years later in 2020, it seems to be riding on a reputation of former glory.
- Supervisors want to hire MBAs out the FLRP program but are complaining that they aren’t given the budget to create a permanent role for MBA FLRPs who they work with. It results in FLRPs being stuck in limbo where they may get a permanent role in the future from the supervisors they have worked with.
- FLRP MBAs have been backing out of their contracts recently and leaving Nationwide altogether within a few years or even more quickly.
- I was told many areas of Nationwide don’t have the budget or aren't allowed to hire MBA FLRPs for permanent roles even if they want to. Undergraduate FLRPs are cheaper for hiring managers because their salaries are lower than MBAs, which results in more post-FLRP job openings for undergraduate FLRPs.
- FLRP used to recruit from top 10 MBA programs such as Yale, Harvard, and Michigan in addition to the valedictorians from mid-tier MBA programs. However, all 20 of the FLRP MBAs from Yale, Harvard, and Michigan have left Nationwide. It is strange how rapidly top talent leaves Nationwide.
- If you want to work for Nationwide after MBA school, consider bypassing FLRP and applying directly to H-Band roles or Investment Professional roles straight out of MBA school. The risk of spending time in FLRP is it may leave you worse off and in a lower pay band or subject to an anxiety-filled placement process where you are in limbo while the FLRP program has no permanent role for you.
Advice to Management
- FLRP is losing high quality candidates to other employers. It’s a problem when more than half of the MBA FLRPs and internal FLRPs don’t place out of the FLRP program.
- It doesn’t seem to working for Nationwide to provide similar opportunities to FLRPs with vastly different opportunity sets, because the marketplace outside of Nationwide values these backgrounds differently.
A 2-year MBA from a Top 10 program = $170K average salary + bonus. (see US News website).
A 1 year master’s degree from Ohio State = $58K average salary + bonus. (see Ohio State Fisher’s career outcomes website).
- Putting graduates with vastly different opportunity sets in the same functional role or placing them in the same pay band doesn’t seem to be working for Nationwide. If the opportunity set for each of these backgrounds differs, why is FLRP Leadership treating them equivalently?

Use as a financial stepping stone in your career
The atmosphere used to be light

Nationwide had a great atmosphere. Nice people, benefits; 401 K, PTO. There was a sense of comradery. The atmosphere was happier when I started. Once you meet your metrics there are opportunities to work from home twice a week. Management really was fighting work from home though. the company did not appear to want to shift. Many old timers used to paper pushing and management was not willing to lose their control. There was no outlook to extend wfh at the time but the building was pretty empty so, the company may be going that route.
","After the layoffs, I think that it just got scary at Nationwide and the atmosphere just began to feel gloomy. Many employees were leaving or were laid off. The employees that stayed, felt overworked and under appreciated and the atmosphere became robotic. I believe that these feelings can happen anywhere because the company was obviously going through major changes.

You can look around nationwide and get a feel for who will succeed. It's some part work ethic and part who you know. (Can happen anywhere)

I got sick of feeling like I was in preschool. I believe that the company trying to establish some positive reinforcement but I really felt like my intelligence was being tampered with as we were coerced with prize boxes and ice cream days. I just didn't want to pretend that I didn't have work to do and as if I wasn't stressed with layoffs and people leaving, more work was piled on our desks (which happens anywhere.

I accept that if you're a slacker then you get treated like one, but when you work so hard and do so much for the company and get nothing in return... awful management.
Now with the riots and racism, the CEO told the white employees to find a black employee and say you're sorry for their pain and suffering! What?

Pros
Nationwide has a great culture and if you work hard you will be rewarded. The size of the company provides opportunity to gain experience in many different areas. Nationwide takes great care of their employees offering robust benefits.
Cons
Just like any company there are cons. I would say the large size also can make it difficult to make a name for yourself outside of your current area if you are interested in learning something new. But this is a small thing in comparison with all of the good.

","I worked for Nationwide for about a year and a half total. I was deployed for about 10 months of that time frame. Upon coming home from my deployment, I had resigned since I found a new job. I was then sent a bill in the mail saying I owed about $3400 to Nationwide, due to hours that were not able to process in their system, that they ""paid"" me for. I went through a 2 month period of going back and forth with them, trying to explain that if I was over paid that amount of money, I would have realized it. I ended up settling the issue with them (right around the Christmas holidays), and owed them around $450 for money that was over paid to me. The entire issue was that when I was on drill weekends, even though I would request to not be paid from the company while I was not there, they still continued to pay me. I did not realize the entire time that I worked there. The company ran an audit back in March (while I was deployed) and found the issue, but did not mention it to me at all until I came home. So a great holiday season to me, when I have an unexpected bill of $500. I understand that if you overpaid me, that I have to pay it back. But the fact that they even over paid me in the first place, and then didn't mention it to me until 7 months later. If you are in the military and drill, be careful of how you input your time into their system, or you may receive a hefty bill from them down the road. 

Overall, the company/people/benefits were great, and I enjoyed my time working there, but I felt betrayed by the company for how they handled my situation.
Advice to Management
Fix your time off reporting system, so people do not get overpaid without realizing it, and then receive a bill 7 months after the issue was known, but not brought up to the employee.

","I have worked 8 years for this company and have gotten to see many stages of change which is normal in the corporate world. But when I started it seemed like one of those dream companies where they recognize hard work and everyone is engaged in the work they do. And they tell you this in the interview, on the walls where they post their values and just about every company email but the ones that stick around know the truth. The best advice I can give is get the experience you need, get your degree on them and leave for greener pastures before the smell of the poo rises to high. The only way to move up in the company is to be a brown nose or be related to a person that gives you a recommendation. Other wise your experience and work ethic get you no where.

Trust your people. Big Brother mentality leads to resentment, loss of productivity and loss of employees. Take the logos off your car because only cheap insurance companies keep them on. State Farm, Farmers, Liberty Mutual, Mercury Insurance don't have any decals and they all do great. No one buys insurance because of your logos. People do hate insurance companies though and your logo is a bulls-eye on the sides and the back of the car.

Higher levels ask for options on what you think would be best for customers (because we are the ones who speak with them every day) but then decline any of our recommendations. They tell us what they decided to do would actually be best and this is 'what the customers have been asking for'. Typically make things with customers 10x harder than it really needs to be.

If you wanted to go from being a cobol developer to a java developer they will help you make that transition. Pay is right around what other companies pay from what I have seen. The best thing about the company is work life balance and flexibility. Having kids requires you to work from home sometimes when they are sick and they allow you to do that and the hours are flexible too as long as your 8 hour day falls in the core hours of 9-3. So you can work 7-3 or 9-5 and you can shift that when ever you need to. So having a family that is the best benefit to me. Also we do Agile development so we commit to work we can complete in a 2 week period so there is not overtime or stress about working more than your 8 hours.

Good place to start if you have no insurance background
","Unfortunately, Nationwide is struggling with their loss ratios and making cuts left and right. When someone leaves, they no longer backfill the position...just split it up between the remaining team. They have rolled out LEAN (which is effectively a program that puts all problems back onto it the employees to fix). Everything is numbers driven, so you have to explain why you have had a less productive day. Micro-managing in its definition. No growth opportunities (obviously) and they struggle to retain talent. The last 3 positions I took were lateral, meaning no raise. Pay is far below industry average so top talent goes elsewhere. They try to make up for the lacking pay in “culture”...but you can’t feed your family with culture. I worked for NW for almost a decade and saw a very, very low moral and apathy from leadership in the past few years. No real direction...very reactive to the market instead of proactive. There is a reason they grew so fast...they wrote pretty much everything for years, and now dealing with the consequences of that in terms of loss ratios.

If you are reading this and currently with NW, do yourself a favor and check out other companies. I easily found a position offering 30% more pay with about half of the workload.

If you are looking to work at Nationwide, the only advantage would be when you’re new to insurance and need an education. They do that well.

I have been working at Nationwide full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Nationwide focuses and diversity in the workforce and invests in developing its associates. The benefits and salary offered by Nationwide show the company is dedicated to the growth of its employees as the insurance industry rapidly changes. The company offers tuition reimbursement, along with paid time off for both parents for births and adoptions, to name a few of the great things there is to offer. In addition to the employee benefits, the company is investing in its strategy and technology to ensure that our customers needs from insurance to financial are covered from youth through retirement years and beyond.
Cons
Nationwide has made many changes recently in its strategy and organizational structure. Although these may have seemed like cons during times of transition, they are actually a benefit to the employees and customers. With over 10 years in the company, I have little negative to say. If opportunities arise, senior leaders are quick to devote time in identifying solutions and taking action.

","Young management with little or no experience in the jobs they manage. Claim authority for field reps is ridiculous. Those who came up with the Farmer From Illinois should stay away. It's like going back in time. They are making all of mistakes we resolved 10-15 years ago. No in-office claim reps. Hourly workers that blindly pay from contractor's estimate.

I found no reals claims people working at a level I was use to until I met Richard and Dave at there annual meeting. Finally people with real field claims experience. I could not see where the disconnect was. Two obvious seasoned veterans with all the right experience and stories to share yet the leaders under them have hardly any field experience at all. You just cut 1100 employees due to no fault of there own. They suffer from your poor management group and poor customer service due to your workflows. You need to hire a consulting firm to bring your team up to speed. You are ruining peoples lives with the promises you make them in your interview process. You can hire as a local rep and they will send you across the country to work in a territory where someone quit for no additional money. Who signed up for that? When it happened to one of my teammates I called my assistant director and asked whats that about? She said ""oh we told you about that in your interview."" I said you did not because i would not have taken the job if you had.

Good luck Nationwide.

Mon Feb 18 2019,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Doesn’t value their employees,13,"Coworkers have always been the best thing about the company. Some locations have free parking and a free gym.
","Where to start? Multiple reorganizations over the more than decade I’ve been there. Lack of transparency from leadership, although they promise it, it’s not delivered. You can expect to be silo’d with zero cross department training. And also expect to pigeonholed. Some leaders are great, others are not. Some leaders actually manadate no performance ratings over a certain level for the entire department. No consistency between departments. 

As for their ‘Greatest Places to Work’ award - not every employee participates or even receives the poll. 

Top leadership is in such a hurry to have a ‘plan’ they don’t bother the think through the intended and unintended consequences, so a few months down the road, they’ll change their minds and off they’ll go in another direction . Constance upheavals in process. 

Because the company is so severely silo’d - multiple versions of the same operations/systems- wasted money that they attempt to remedy through layoffs of experienced personnel. Don’t expect that your high performance will save you from a lay-off - if your job code is selected, you’ll just be gone, performance doesn’t matter. Nor will decades with the company. And while they will give lip service to trying to place you in a new position- that’s all it is. They need to change their slogan because they can hardly offer “On your side” service by slashing as much experience as they have over the last few years. 

Benefits: bare minimum. In spite of being self insured for many of the products, including health insurance- high prices and high deductibles. And a paternalistic attitude including health screenings that while not mandatory, if you don’t participate, you’ll be paying even more for your health insurance. 

Because of the understaffing, work hours are often long and carry over to the weekends. Expect to figure out your own solutions as training is spotty and leadership very well may not have the experience to guide you.
Advice to Management
Stop cutting the experienced staff. If you want to save money, cuts to staff isn’t the way to do it. Try cutting needless building refurbishment, outside consultants, or sales trips. Don’t just say you’re transparent- actually be transparent. Enforce your own rules regarding cross department training and career advancement- don’t leave it up to a hiring manager who may be too lazy to want to train someone. Give more than lip service to “We Value People” because laying off round after round of experienced staff who have literally given decades of their life to the company and sacrificed countless late night and weekend hours, speak more about how the company actually views their associates than some slick slogan.

I worked in the Santa Rosa office years ago when it was Allied Insurance. Nationwide bought Allied and a couple of years closed that office and moved to Sacramento. Bummer, but everyone really had almost a year to find alternative employment. And I did. Always grateful that they gave everyone that lead time. Fast forward ten years. I find myself in Sacramento and re-hired by Nationwide. Good experience. Actually, better in Sacramento. Good caring people. Stayed for about three years when I found a better opportunity. At that time underwriters were no longer assigned to individual agents - hence no real relationship building. Once that happened, it seemed there was no reason someone sitting in the home office couldn't do what I was doing. 
Personal lines was mostly automated. Now commercial lines is heading that way and I hear employees are being laid off.

Lots of resource groups depending on interests
Maternity leave 4 weeks 
Very receptive to helping those with disabilities and medical work condition requirements.
","Depending on the department you’re in you may not be able to utilize all resource groups the company has. 
Constant system issues
Focus not not the quality, but quantity while demanding outrageous quality standards. Succeeding here sometimes feels like succeed in a vacuum, it’s almost impossible some days. 
Updates made monthly to become more “big brother” like environment. 
Despite boasting to “Work as one Nationwide” the departments have almost no interaction/communication with one another leading to so much confusion for internal employees and customers. 
Male leaders sexist towards women in terms of bonuses/raises, daily standards, and behaviors in general. 
Layoffs are the new norm and even if you’re not currently at risk of a layoff supervisors constantly bring up possibilities if you don’t perform above goals. 
Leaders make threats to withhold bonuses and raises and threaten to demote if you decline to take on advancement roles. 
Unable to request time off unless more than a month in advance. 
Outdated/very strict occurrence policy. 1/2 an occurrence for being more than 5 mins late, that’s insane. 
Attendance policy also encourages you to lie to supervisor. If your child/family is sick you get 1 occurrence per day you’re out. If your sick you get 1 occurrence for up to 5 days you’re out. My supervisor even told me to give him no details in the future or he’d be forced to give me multiple occurrences for telling the truth when I missed 2 days due to a sick child. 
Unable to seek assistance from leaders when needed as they’re always in meetings, even harder for WFH associates. 

I could go on and on, but I truly wish I’d avoided this company.

","Workload has grown to unrealistic levels and upper management focuses on justifying the workload rather than finding solutions. This is across the entire Nationwide claims platform
Pay is mediocre for the industry standard and the raises are minimal regardless of performance levels now. ""Profit sharing"" is pathetic excuse of a bonus opportunity. 
When hired they will tell you that CAT is required and you may work 1-3 months depending how many major storms hit. 4 tours of CAT duty has been a light year for most adjusters I know over the last 3 years.
Advice to Management
Evaluate and communicate your true goal as a company. Customer service is tanking due to overbearing workloads and false expectations being sold to customers. This is not the same Nationwide that has been providing insurance for many decades. Too much focus on cutting operating costs and not enough focus on changing a failing operating strategy. Instead of changing direction with the wind and hiring external consultants to fix your profitability, consider who you want to be as a company and let the market's reaction determine your success or failure.

The atmosphere was happier when I started. Once you meet your metrics there are opportunities to work from home twice a week. There was no outlook to extend it at the time but the building was pretty empty so, they may be going that route.
","After the layoffs, I think that it just got scary at Nationwide and the atmosphere just began to feel gloomy. Many employees were leaving or were laid off. The employees that stayed, felt overworked and under appreciated and the atmosphere became robotic. I believe that these feelings can happen anywhere because the company was obviously going through major changes. 

You can look around nationwide and get a feel for who will succeed. It's some part work ethic and part who you know. (Can happen anywhere) 

I got sick of feeling like I was in preschool. I believe that they were trying to establish some positive reinforcement but I really felt like my intelligence was being tampered with as we were coerced with prize boxes and ice cream days. I just didn't want to pretend that I didn't have work to do and as if I wasn't stressed with layoffs and people leaving, more work was piled on our desks (which happens anywhere.

","This is a company with strong associates/direct managers, but is an unfortunate example of how poor corporate leadership leads to constant strategy changes. It’s an insurance heavyweight that has been far too slow to adapt to a changing market and truly lacks the vision to correct its trajectory. Financial plans are set based on what leadership and “the board” WANTS to happen as opposed to what WILL happen. Expenses are so far out of whack with the market, and their solution is to create a bunch of new departments with catchy names that make it seem like NW is far more relevant than it truly is. They can’t go 2 years without a complete shift in long term strategy. They are flailing.

Advice to Management
Let IT operate like it's own company and stop enforcing top-down processes across the enterprise that prevent IT from being effective. Phase out hiring low quality contractors, and think about how to improve hiring and recruiting in order to bring in more high quality full time employees (think about how you can be more competitive and attract talent, rather than trying out how to do more with less talent - i.e. rigid processes to attempt to prevent unskilled contractors from breaking things).

Phase out hiring low quality contractors, and think about how to improve hiring and recruiting in order to bring in more high quality full time employees (think about how you can be more competitive and attract talent, rather than trying out how to do more with less talent - i.e. rigid processes to attempt to prevent unskilled contractors from breaking things).

I have been working at Nationwide full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
In general, Nationwide has a great culture and a focus around valuing the diversity of talents and abilities each person brings to the table. Benefits and compensation are very competitive.
Cons
My experience has been that the work/life balance becomes more difficult to manage as you move up into roles of increased responsibility. This is universally true regardless of employer and industry, and Nationwide is not an exception to this general rule.

","Merit increases and incentive structures do not motivate individuals towards achievement. They are small enough to really be quite insignificant.

","Company does not live up to its values that it preaches to its associates. They claim it’s a Great Company “for me, my family, and my future”; Great Opportunity “for my career and well being.” Then... they put you on Catastrophe duty (CAT duty). Which is whenever there is a catastrophe that affects a large number of policyholders your are expected to work 7:00am-7:00pm 7 days a week for 28 days. Which is fine if there is a major weather event that needs additional help. Now Nationwide has not been able to staff appropriately so they are putting associates on CAT duty to cover the lack of employees during normal business times. There are some people that have gone on 6,7, or even 8 CAT tours this year. This means that They have spent 6,7, or 8 months working 7:00am-7:00pm 7 days a week! I don’t even know how this is legal let alone meets Nationwide’s standards of “well-being” for employees or let’s the associate have any kind of work life balance. 

It’s also a viscous circle, you go on CAT because Nationwide is short staffed, people quit because they have to keep working CAT. Management is so out of tough with their employees it’s insane.

Pay is not bad. 401-K match is good.
Cons
Very micro managed work environment. One yearly goal is to do more with less! No consistency within the management teams. Long time employees treated like rookies. They can talk the talk but can't seem to walk the walk. They place no value in there employees and have no qualms about pushing one out the door.

The workload is so unbearable, you get about 10 new claims on Monday and fridays and sometimes during the week. Then about 6 or 7 other days. Don’t forget the other 60-100 claims you already have to work on.
This job is almost equivalent to a call center. Managers listen in on calls and will sit with you while you take calls to make sure you’re doing good.
Oh, don’t forget the accountability boards. Managers post everyone’s numbers up on the board on your team and you have DAILY meetings to go over those numbers. Don’t have the lowest numbers because you’ll be completely embarrassed during these meetings.
If you are actually one of the lucky few doing a decent job, watch out, they will make you take on the workload of those that can’t keep up....

Advice to Management
Get rid of the Gallup Engagement survey as most associates aren't truthful with their ratings because, if you rate anything low or poorly, it just means more work for the associates because the managers have to come up with ""action plans"". Those action plans are usually just developed to ""check the box"" for the management team's sake to say they addressed the issues. Associates have learned to just rate everything a 5 so they don't have to be a part of any action plans that are meaningless. Senior leadership team needs a complete overhaul. Have small group feedback sessions where the managers are not in the sessions. I think you'd be shocked to hear what your associates really think of the leadership team and/or company as a whole.

The company is a strong supporter of being who you are (most of the time).
The company honors our service men and women.
The workforce is mostly composed of some truly amazing people.
The pay is ok.
There are a lot of corporate discounts/perks.
","The benefits are awful. I appreciate that we have any benefits at all, but they need to take a look at health plans and make sure to diversify their offerings.
While there is plenty of opportunity for upward mobility, you will only get if you know someone. Nationwide is big on nepotism. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard the phrase, ""it's all about who you know."" 
Their expectations of claims staff is outlandish, and the pay is only marginally better that mediocre.
Advice to Management
Develop and promote based on merit, not how well someone can rub elbows.
Do some market research on AWE, salary, average work assignments per rep/adjuster, and how ineffective and misleading customer satisfaction surveys actually are.
Listen to your employees.
Do not treat your employees as if they are unruly children who need to be micromanaged.

","Absolutely a terrible work environment. There were new executives and they were completely lost in this area. Kept piling on underwriters and case managers, spending money and eventually lost the leader of underwriting to a competitor. There was not any open dialogue going on, so forget about discussions, disagreements were frowned upon. Everybody talked behind each other. Most of the work is transactional, so it is not challenging or interesting. Most work can all be automated but there is a huge fight between IT and business units across Nationwide. There is very little self service for life insurance and annuity products. It acts as a backend processing unit for the sales organization. There is a small CI team with a smart manager that is underutilized.

Advice to Management
Listen to your young leadership coming up and stop thinking when you take a AVP role that you have to completely change everything in order to create efficiency. Stick with a strategy for more then 6 months in order to see if it can be successful. Stop cutting to the bone and then finding out that you don't have enough people to do the workload. This means that you will actually have to get to know your leadership to better understand their environment before you make those decisions.

","Large overhead spent on pointless leadership positions. Never seen a company work someone with endless tasks. Management never owns up to try and streamline. It’s the ‘yes sir’ company. Lack of communication from all leadership. And now the layoffs because of the large salaries of leadership, which has created an adverse work environment for the ‘worker bees’. 

HR is useless in protecting anyone but themselves. 

Endless spending on marketing versus fixing the broken glitches in systems which would actually save them more money than cutting people. They’d rather just outsource everything (and they have in droves), instead of building a stable, productive, and fun work environment. 

This is just a small taste...toxic environment is spreading and will ultimately be a big negative on a lot of people. Watch out if you join ‘The Nation’.
Advice to Management
You’ve lost touch with what made the company successful. Instead you’re slashing jobs because you think that’s the answer. You’ve allowed broken systems to take hold and a terrible brotherhood of placing ‘not my job’ leaders who take no ownership for making things work properly and they also fail to communicate at all across the silos of departments. You’re legacy is in the hands of some poor leaders and inundated with a mass of people who just delegate so they don’t have to do anything.

They make the environment more productive and fun than it would be otherwise. Overall I enjoyed my years with Nationwide thanks to those I got to work with.
","For the last 5 years of my employment at Nationwide they were always in a state of reorganization. Every department at every level was constantly under the threat of being reorganized and often what was created was lowering the pay grades and reducing the number of people on the team. So you could make it through the reorg and be asked to stay and your earning power peaked or you would be asked to leave and take your severance and talents elsewhere. Not a pleasant environment to work in.
