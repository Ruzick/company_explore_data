They respect that employees have a life outside of work and really do seem to want to put the needs of employees first. This being said, there are still high expectations to fulfill expectations.
- PTO is generous (if you are able to take it) and other benefits are very attractive.
- The firm has a rich history and a wealth of resources for you to learn from. The networking opportunities within the firm are endless - there are employees that are top in their field in nearly every facet of the industry.
","- I unknowingly took an entry level call center job. I was told this was a job for one with 2-5 years of industry experience, securities licenses, and a college degree. Many of my colleagues have none of those. I was told I would be in relationship management and that this position builds a solid foundation to transition into something like investment banking or asset management. First week on the job I find I'm just resetting people's passwords all day.
- The company is huge. If you are not okay with bureaucracy, it might not be a great place for you.
- Because the company is huge, many employees in certain positions are expendable (such as those in service roles like this one). Sometimes it feels you could be cut at a moment's notice for poor performance metrics.

","Managers are inept, to be completely honest I’m not sure what they do because the phone reps do 99.99% of the work. Technology never works correctly and when people ask why? You can’t really give them an answer. Managers have no clue how to communicate. They will lie to you every chance they get, they lose a lot of good talent because they turned this place into a sweatshop. Prior to May 6th 2020 this was a more relaxed environment and they didn’t slave drive like they do now. Once the department went from operations to Wealth management the entire dept went to crap. when you have an issue management just tells you to deal with it instead of finding a solution. The entire service metrics are totally out of wack ex. If you’re 1min late you’re technically 2mins late with how they track things. Since you’re 1 min off and 1min not logged in it’s scored against adherence as 2mins. So if you go over a long time on a phone call into your break you’re screwed. I never worked for her but Lindsey is an absolute joke of a manager and should be fired immediately. All I hear her talk about is how drunk she gets when she’s not working. Really the only person who knows what’s going on there is Linda. Don’t work here if you can help it. I was lucky I found a much much better job and left.

Stop thinking that ""year of experience"" or ""years at Morgan Stanley"" shows how valuable an employee is. In fact people that have stayed at the company for a long time lack original ideas and abuse their power through politics. There is no consequence for not delivering. Start measuring KPIs and OKRs and hold leadership accountable. The lack of accountability is baffling.

","In the beginning, the management will paint a picture of a career path. You will interview with 2-3 managers. They will pick you apart to make you assume this is a valued position. 
If you're dumb enough to believe their initial lies, HR will call you and promise, 2 bonuses within the first year, lie #1. Tuition reimbursement, lie #2. When I started, you were told you would graduate out of the MSVA program and take a small book of business with you to the field, lie #3. No accounts leave the MSVA, and they have you sign a non compete to make sure of it. They get you to buy in on them paying for a CFP after a year on the floor, lie #4. They dropped the sponsorship program for the CFP. If you have an annuities license, they will use you for it for no additional competition. They don't offer cost of living raises. Management will micromanage you till death so you become a robot. They prey on recent college graduates. Management will throw you under the bus to save their poor management skills. The MSVA has a revolving door. If you're smart, you escape this prison. They want you to drink from the enormous koolaid fountain in the kitchen and keep your mouth shut. And if you open it, you have a target on your back and they will have a vendetta to terminate you. Toxic culture. They don't care at all about their employees, if they do, it's just an act. The executives from NY know it and just smile at their slaves.

","This is the most oppressive workplace I have ever worked at - GFC is insanely political and there is absolutely 0 chance for promotion. I have been employed here for three years as entry-level, busting my butt and have not been promoted. The worst part is they have no logical reason. Also, you hardly get a raise, if you even get a raise at all. The management teams are like cliques and you need to do as you're told and not ask any questions at all that they don't like. I can't speak to the other departments within this firm, but as far as Global Financial Crimes goes - stay away.

Professional hires with more real-world experience should avoid Morgan - they'll be frustrated by the lack of management sophistication and the absence of leadership and direction.

Replace current middle and senior managers with outside professional managers that have modern, fresh ideas. Put in place sincere transformational programs to replace aging proprietary technologies. Establish a commercially-minded IT culture which emphasizes better design and strategy.

Teams consistently suffer from burnout, no one provides direction , people are constantly complaining about how unhappy they are everyday.
Advice to Management

-A lot of flexibility with your schedule
","- Managers here are hit or miss I’m saying that on the basis that most of us have had every single manager here due to disorganization and restructuring. Some managers really want to see you grow while others don’t mind letting you sit in your role until you burn out and leave.

- A lot of disorganization and misinformation, a lot of having to lie to clients because the firm doesn’t want you to tell them why something is being done to their account.

- I would go on but I rather give advice. If you’re considering working here as a licensed agent and you’re unlicensed, my advice would be to come in and study really hard every day because if you don’t pass your test you’re pretty much fired I’ve seen this done with over 20+ employees. So study really hard and get licensed and then once you’re licensed I would start looking for another place to work. If you are licensed I would avoid this place all together. Take my advice however you want.
Advice to Management
Help your employees grow and succeed, you only license them because you have to. once licensing is done there’s essentially no more opportunities to continue to educate yourself and pursue other designations while there is significant down time at work. Also, hire more experience managers, not all are bad but some are just heavily inexperienced and shouldn’t be in there role. Lastly, treat your employees better, this place is heading towards being a well oiled machine where we’re all factory workers, rather than a professional environment. You need to realize that we’re millennials and have nothing but options, this is not the 1950’s where you sit at 1 job for 40+ years and then retire.

Advice to Management
Hiring younger professional should be partner with a senior advisor. Most senior advisors are not using all the technology platforms nor know how too. Most of their book of business is sustainable because they just wait till someone quits or moves on. I was told I was going to start receiving bigger accounts 9 months before I was let go, and never received anything. Was I going to work harder if I was promised things that never happened? Morale was low. 

Don't pressure new employees or set a timeline to hit their sales quota. It rushes them to tap into their circle of influence, while they are not in a rush to switch firms, the employee will push them to and get ignored. 
 
Would like to work for Morgan Stanley again, so even thought this may be ""anonymous"" you can find me again.

","There is a glaring issue with direct management. Lots of laziness, promises not kept, and looking out for themselves. You are asked to enforce standards yet the managers never hold themselves to the same level of expectations. And somehow upper management never catches wind of this behavior, or turns a blind eye to their ineffective management team. This ends up causing the subordinates to feel unappreciated and overworked. People in my group who have been promoted to VP or PM have literally no clue how to use certain softwares yet are in their roles??? Tenure instead of knowledge - that’s why. I have experienced gaslighting and condescending remarks from direct managers in my role and have mentioned this on EOY reviews, yet nothing changes. Constant reorganization of our group, which disrupts lots of effective processes, to be replaced with archaic ways of doing things. Often work in silos with little to no interaction with the broader group. No “budget” to travel to different offices to have face to face time, yet will send other managers to conventions and other external events.

","Kind of dead-end- you'd better want to be in Ops for life or you very easily will paint yourself into a corner.

Stagnant salary growth can be very discouraging.

We are not ignorant of the fact that newcomers frequently start at a higher rate than veterans.

The advisers are very generous (they have the option of giving a discretionary bonus throughout the year). They are also always willing to mentor new people.

He gave me so many opportunities to grow as an analyst. If you’re in wealth management, your experience will depend on the team you’re with. I loved my direct team but was not fond of management in Palo Alto. You will meet good and hard working people at Morgan Stanley.
","Unless you’re a financial advisor... you’re out of luck. If you’re an analyst or associate you’re not really valued by the firm. They even call us “support staff” to show that we were just there to support. I was a high performing analyst in a high performing team. I unfortunately had to deal with individuals that discriminated me based on my age and gender and experienced bullying during my time at Morgan Stanley. I was initially shocked because it’s never happened to me before at any other firm. I brought it up to management and HR multiple times and nothing was done. I wasn’t really listened to all they cared about was performance and not morale. There was also an instance when we lost a member of our team. It’s managements responsibility to hire a new replacement. They never did to cut costs and I was tasked to do the job of 2 people for 10 months which stalled my career significantly and mental well being. I worked 11 hour days and weekends to make up for it. Again... prioritizing performance and money over morale.
Advice to Management
Does not try to stay competitive among millennials. A lot of my peers left only after a year or two to go into tech or to work at other companies where they felt valued, got promoted and received salary increases. Management shouldn’t underestimate the importance of treating their employees well. You don’t need to spend a ton of money but just showing that you care about our career ambitions would make us want to stay. I’ve never felt so unimportant and unvalued than I have during my time at Morgan Stanley.

","Location and salary. You have to pay MD state and Baltimore city tax (or if you live outside, whatever the local rate is) which are very high, you have to pay for parking, which can be nearly $200/mo depending on which office you’re in and the crime in Baltimore is so bad, a lot of my co workers and myself felt unsafe to even venture outside the office. There were actually several instances of crimes occurring right outside the office. Also, housing around the area is very expensive, the traffic is awful, and the roads in the city are a disaster. My advice is if you’re thinking about a career here, ask for a lot of money, find a decent area well outside of the city to live and don’t venture out away from the office, particularly the downtown location. I wasn’t being compensated nearly enough to live a decent quality of life around there.
