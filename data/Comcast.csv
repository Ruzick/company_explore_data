","The B2B Comcast Business environment is you never do or close enough. The expectation of management is they always want more clients, more products sold, more hours worked, work your holidays, etc. Typical with any corporate giant company, the sales goals is what is important over the value an employee brings. The biggest obstacle in this position is you are competing against the inside sales team. You can secure an account and inside sales will undercut/sell the business out from under you.. You follow-up with client and they already have services under contract. Also commission structure changed and you are paid on discounted services rather then full price. You sign a client for a 3 year contract and they pay you once on initial products sold. There is never a residual compensation and/or renewal compensation to sales force.

Pros
Great benefits and product portfolio
Cons
-No strategy. It's a constant daily grind.
-Internal politics & optics are the driving factors for promotion.
-Customer Experience
-Majority of the leadership team is focused on serving up the chain of command instead of serving down to ensure a best-in-class customer experience and positive employee engagement. The culture suffers tremendously from this.

","Probably the single worst sales environment I’ve worked in. It’s very cut throat. highly political and many reps cheat their way to their quota and little is done to enforce their so called rules of engagement. Poor management and leadership throughout the sales organization. Way too many direct reps in the field “killing” each other for deals and competing with alternate sales channels for the same customers. No territory protections, it’s the kill or be killed sales model. During my tenure 80%+ failure rate of reps in this role. Management to loves to use performance planning to run you out of the business.
Advice to Management
Stop preaching about how great the culture is and clean it up. The sales culture is rotten to the core and all the front line sales people know it. Your narrative is shameful along with how overtly political the organization is. Reduce quota and reduce the headcount and give more people a chance at success, if not this organization is a temporary stop for very good people and the organization is worse off for your structure.

Mon Jan 04 2021, Sales Engineer,"Salt Lake City, UT",Current Employee ,One of the best ISPs to work for,0,"So far, it is the best ISP to work for. There is a clear message from leadership. Listen to any of the quarterly earnings calls, they don't talk about what fire needs to be put out that month. There is a clear focus on growth, clear plans for correcting company problems and metrics to show movement forward.
","The salary is a little lower then other ISPs, but....I traded that for a stable work environment and focused upper-leadership. 
Comp plan is also a little lower, but regional numbers are way ahead of other ISPs sales numbers....easy double digit.
Came from a company that had FTO to PTO. Kind of a Con but a better trade.
Advice to Management
Stay focused. Don't try to hop into industry trends like other ISPs where industry leaders are already dominating that market segment. 
Look into changing PTO to a FTO model, like Adobe or other industry giants. It removes the unfunded liability of carry over time. And we are all grown ups.

Sat Jan 16 2021, Tech Support Representative,"Horsham, PA",Former Employee ,"Rotating Cubicle Job"" with VERY small chance of career advancement in a fear driven Monopoly Company",0,"- You can end up with a great group of people in your team (10-20 people group / cubicles), but then a month later be transferred to a different one. 
- Great health care, discounts from different companies (Ford, Jaguar some Cells phone providers and more)
- Some fun activities takes place like ""shooting hoops"" (in the cafeteria) for some prizes, these activities just a simple suggestion in HR books for releasing stress, and they don't care about it at all, plus they only allow it for you own your 30min lunch.
- If your weekly / monthly results a great & beats others, you get little gifts (cups, scarfs, t-shirts etc) closer parking spot for a week (the sad old big corp ""make you feel better"" tactics)
","- Absolutely HORRIBLE Software / Tools to work and help customers. You have to start 5 different programs, 4-6 different tabs when you come in. Even the PC's struggle to run it all. It's so bad, we wrote BAT file our selves! This way you don't sit there for 10min before everything ready or like very often happens, you forget to open one of them & realize only when talking to a customers which takes another few minutes. I was blown away how such size ""monopoly"" company can have software older than some of its employees using it. Never seen anything like it, you would think they invest money to fix it, this way calls would shorten by 30%, fewer customers in Q or even better save $ since you would need fewer employees.
- You get 30min for lunch just like another 50 people. If you bring something that needs use of microwave forget about it, 3 microwaves for such head count will take 35min before you sit down with your meal. 1min late & system flags you. There is option to order food from outside food cook who runs little sandwich / cheesecake / salad business in the lunchroom with crazy prices. So get used to wending machine or will end up eating while at your desk like most.
- Some Tech Support team supervisors have ABSOLUTELY no IT experience, it was jaw dropping at first, but later you get used to stuffing like that.
- You are a number, NOTHING more. Which is very expect able from such company in size facility. It's like conveyor belt, one training class hits the floor next day you see new class forming and cycle repeats non-stop. It's due to very small % staying for longer then 6 months. Some people come with hopes without knowing how such companies operate. They don't care about you personally (which is perfectly normal) and after seeing how everything works you won't care about them, you are a number to them, and they are a paycheck to you. Most people get better offers while there and quit, others get let go due to low results. It's business.
- Management / Supervisors usually more scared then cubicle people. They know their success depends on their team (too bad team don't realize that) and due to lack of knowledge of the IT itself, the most they lack is leadership, people skills. So they end up sitting and praying for team to pass the metrics so the bigger guy won't come to have a conversation. 
- Apart just a gray cubicle desk job the whole feel of the surroundings is horrible, the tension so high, you can literally see the fear in peoples eyes which blown me away. The fake smiles (for 0.5 second) from upper management, the HR's question ""how are you"" which never follows with name since they have no idea is just a recipe 8 hours of horrible time for employees who already not making much in those gray cubicles...
Advice to Management
- Come up with your own tactics how to make team more successful, do your own research on how can that be achieved, don't just follow companies suggestions from your training book. If it works, talk to HR, maybe few other teams will take some notice what you came up with.
- Don't be afraid of going to ""bigger"" guys and push for your team. Find the most IT savvy guy on your team and work with him, make him your right hand, this way you can help with software (like BAT file to start all that junk for the whole team) and you will have more info about how your team feels, what's they concern and how you can help. Be a leader

","Company is not well-liked. Prepare to get yelled at any time you meet someone and they ask where you work.

Rotating 24-hour on call duties for if applications or servers go down. Not too bad, but it's not for everyone. Some DevOps responsibilities without the technologies to make our resumes look good.

Culture is very much ""figure it out like I did"" instead of making things better for those to come. 

From a SDLC perspective, almost everything is outdated: tech stack, deployment process, etc - which means you'll have to hustle outside of work to stay current if you ever want to work elsewhere. New tech was seen as slowing down team velocity.

Having to support legacy software (I scoured the web to find an old Oracle driver to support this one system). Management only sees capital expenses, so the time expense of developers putting in excessive hours to keep creaky legacy stuff running isn't considered an issue. 

Have to integrate apps with internal (read: un-Googleable) APIs that are not well documented, supported by uncommunicative offshore teams.

Sun Dec 20 2020, Customer Account Executive,"Portland, OR",Current Employee ,Great work environment - but too bureaucratic,0,"Comcast provides you with every opportunity to succeed and has amazing lower and mid level management. As a sales person they make it very hard to fail. Working in the call center you have a lot of structure which is great if you are new to sales. They are very transparent about goals and the supervisor do their best to give you insight to the bigger picture. I have been working here for about 3 and a half years and the work environment as well as pay and benefits are the main reason I have stuck around. If you really put work in you have the opportunity to make a lot of money. Also, they have very frequent incentives which helps a lot with motivation.
","While the structure is great as a new sales rep it can be a little limiting as a more experienced representative. Typical to any call center, there are things you must say and and a sales process that you must follow even if it is not the right presentation for the call/customer. The job itself is pretty repetitive and not very exciting. After a few years it gets pretty boring, but I don't believe this is Comcast's fault but just the nature of a call center. I would like to put one caveat to that statement that I do have coworkers that still love the job after 10+ years, I am just not one of them.

","Filled will back stabbing talentless people who would otherwise be unemployed if it were not for comcast. Make no mistake comcast is a fake technology company that has no idea how innovation works. They have made all of the money by buying vendor solutions, duck taping them together, and selling them to people that have no other option but to buy them. Don’t expect to work your way to the top in this company, save youself the time and resort to kissing rumo and playing politics. It is really all that matters in this company

Mon Dec 14 2020, Indirect Account Executive,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Wanted: Employee 12345XYZ Unwanted: Critical thinking and analysis,0,"Fair Pay....in the beginning, They arbitrarily changed commission and salary pay without warning or notice, demanding you sign a contract with no negotiation or conversation at all. Felt like a bait and switch due to high performance of the team in the beginning of the program.
The team was awesome. Very friendly and helpful team full of potential leaders. They were the bright-side of my tenure with the company. 
Benefits package was excellent.
Severance package.
Autonomy
","-They arbitrarily changed commission and salary pay without warning or notice. 
-They had no concrete game plan for the targeted market.
-They unilaterally changed sales targets without any actual data showing the increase in goals. To put it in perspective, I exceeded goal my first 5 months or so into the position, only to have it increased THREE FOLD. When questioned by the team, management responded with a Chinese arithmetic formula to explain why goals increased. Anyone that had previously questioned those goals and how the program was run (on my team) were excused after the company decided to ""restructure"" and have us interview....for our own jobs. 
-Company pride is one thing, but for the market we were tasked with selling to that pride looked like arrogance to the independent business owners we dealt with. Humility goes a long way within certain communities. 
-Mixed messages and inconsistent standards in the field. Expectations changed as the wind blows. After being a territory manager for the last 6 years I've never seen a company change their stance on expectations so sharply so frequently. The real issue is that none of those changes were reflective of the actual field team reports. They were decided by management that never set foot in the actual territories to see the similarities and differences within each market. My direct manager was awesome. He went to my glorious territory and saw the challenges and opportunities. That's not the issue. His direct management, the decision makers, didn't seem to value that feedback at all. It showed in the overall cohesion of the to teams, who scrambled and did their best with what they were handed on a day to day, and week to week basis. 

In closing, the initiative was hastily put together, with little consistency or clear vision, and as the old saying goes, it rolls downhill. I watched tenured members of the team lose their livelihood with no explanation whatsoever. The ""why"". Covid seems to be an excuse for these unregulated, monolithic companies to take full advantage of hard working, honest, caring American workers, and if nothing else shows you to become your own business in some regard. The lesson? Any company that goes out of their way to show ""they care"" is masking something more insidious underneath. Be humble. Work hard. Do not voice any critique or even suggest changes. The crony system is in full effect in corporate America. Hope this helps someone. Peace and blessings to you all.
Advice to Management
Don't be afraid of critique. The only way to grow and LEARN is to have honest conversations about the business. Believe it or not, someone of a lower title may have better insights into certain areas of the business than you! Especially if you've never set foot into the market. The yessuh massa, robotic, cheerleader, crony approach may save your self security in the short term, but it will lose you valuable insights....and more importantly good people in the long run.

","Comcast, like most larger corporations, has to please shareholders, which means change often happen at risk of alienating customers, and making the roles of its employees even more challenging. Local politics within the company often way down the effectiveness of managers and directors, and they will not win awards for the quality of the overall compensation plan. Comcast spends far too much on outsourcing its customer service duties and often puts surface level thought into major changes that impact the way employees perform day-to-day tasks. The metrics can often be antiquated or not in line with what’s obtainable in a given space of time. Furthermore, the company will turn you off with an ongoing “pat myself on the back” message that it circulates internally, almost as if it’s trying to overcompensate for the misgivings and errors in execution in other areas.

Thu Nov 26 2020, Billing Customer Account Executive,"Saint Paul, MN",Former Employee ,Xfinity/ComcastUniversal,0,"Recognition of hard work, they made you feel valued as an employee no matter your position. They kept employees of all levels well informed about things going on within the company. The benefits were above that of other comparable career rolls. Their training process was the best learning experience I’ve ever encountered in the workplace.
","Compensation outside of non-monetary benefits was lower than average in the career field. Career advancement was a lengthy process, which could not be accelerated, or modified. There was also very little room for advancing career at all, which I found particularly disappointing for a corporation of this size. Every employee has the same pay rate starting out. An almost completely compartmentalized department work environment. Each department worked on a singular subtype of tasks and were unaware what other departments were doing unless they worked directly with those departments and then employees only knew what those departments could do for your department.
Advice to Management
Provide more advancement opportunities, provide competitive pay for more experienced workers. Make the advancement training modifiable, or have the ability to make an accelerated training program. Provide more “remote employee positions” for those who would have more success working from a home environment, rather than a large office setting. Also, provide more cross-department training, most departments were so compartmentalized that the department was completely unaware of the purposes of the other departments outside of their own and the ones they directly worked with on a more regular basis.

","This was a very good job about 5 years ago. Over the past few years, upper management has slowly turned this job into the most unbearable hellscape of micro management I have ever witnessed. They suddenly tripled the amount of forms, paperwork, and meter scans they want, and offered us no extra money for this increased workload. I spent 6 years at this company, and was only making $18.44 an hour by the end. They give you raises based upon how good your metrics are, but the raises are an absolute joke. I had near-perfect metrics, and got a measly 3% raise. It was an absolute joke. There is no point in pushing yourself as hard as you have to in order to get good metrics, because the raise you get is inconsequential. Management is horribly dislocated from the technicians, and does not understand in the slightest what they go through on a day-to-day basis, and creates new policies every month to find new, creative ways to pay us less and less. It’s a complete joke of a company, don’t waste your time with them, you’ll never make any real money here. Management does not listen to your ideas on how to improve the company, and they do not respect their employees in the slightest.
Advice to Management
You need to pay your technicians more. Because of the low pay and repeated disrespect, your technicians are absolutely not on board with helping carry out your goals for the company. Why should they, when you don’t respect them enough to pay them a decent wage? 

Everybody in management should be required to spend a week running a route, every single year, so that you can understand what we go through.

Communicate more effectively with the sales reps about changes that are being made. We received changes without notice in one day. People had lost sales because no one notified us that some deal was changing. Contracts would have to be negotiated with even less trust in you because they couldn’t earn their customer that they needed to sign before it changes. It gives the reps a better chance of closing.

Throughout the entire time I worked here it was quite apparent that appearances and profit are everything. Managers instructed us to lie to government regulators and destroy documents relating to regulated activities. I witnessed immigration status being used as leverage to get immigrants to do unethical and/or illegal things. I experienced retaliation for reporting ethical concerns. Don't get me wrong ... there are good people at Comcast, including some really good managers.

This place is a joke. I know human resources is meant to protect the company, but at what cost? Until a suit lands in your bucket? The fact that this place continues to elevate and protect the narcissistic managers that pathologically lie about employees is going to be their end.

If you want to get an offer at Comast, stick to Residential. CB is a joke. Run by terrible white males who lie and harass females including males who refuse to be controlled by these crazies. They will fire you or drive you out if you call them out on their bs and their zero-tolerance policy on harassment and retaliation is just for show. They tolerate all kinds of harassment and really should be investigated by third parties. 

Forget career opportunities at CB if you're actually smart. You have to be dumb and like being controlled by the boss to get any opportunities. And if you're a female, RUN the other way. One of the managers will try to get with you.

Advice to Management
STOP hiring external Managers with little to no experience leading people! Stop allowing managers to lie about their employees performance. It’s BS that you can get away with making an employee come up with performance and then put him on a final warning when there was no official verbal or written with HR. 



Also watch out for Senior Female Directors that love to travel and are a bit to social with their team. These are the ones that play favorites and say and do very inappropriate things when at company after parties.

If you distance yourself from this high school social club you will slowly start to be retaliated against and once they want you gone will do and say anything they want and build a paper trail to have you fired for so called “poor performance”.

I’ve had some amazing leaders with Comcast and this does not transcribe to all leaders and departments but you know who you are and you have a family and kids and you gross me out.

You can have your arrogant jerkoff manager that you went thru hoops and hurdles to bring on full time. 

He is only damaging your reputation by being arrogant and rude to stakeholders and treating his employees like crap.

What goes around comes around.

Starting off with company you get 15 days PTO, 8 Flex days, 3 floating holidays. Working in the HQ buildings are great except waiting for the elevators takes forever. The discounted cable service is a plus.
Cons
You have to wait one year before you can apply for a new position. Depending on the department, your yearly raises are between 3-5 percent. Also, if you get a job offer into another department, you actually get less than someone who would be hired externally.

With the exception of a select few, the management and supervisors either need to be fired or retrained on how to treat the employees. Certain individuals abuse their power in such a way that I'm surprised they even still have a job. There's no compassion, and the behavior of many of the supervisors I've interacted with go completely against the values Comcast prides itself on having.

","Management is very aggressive when it comes to meeting quotas. They use fear tactics and threaten your job security constantly if you aren’t meeting your metrics. The metrics that they have in place can be difficult to achieve. Especially during Covid-19.

The work / home life flexibility is pretty rough too. They give you an adequate amount of time off but micromanage how and when you can use it. You must adhere to a strict schedule that literally plans out every minute of your day. Also, they only do schedule changes once per year. So if you get stuck with something you don’t like, there is no way out of it.

The pay structure is a joke too. They basically give you a fixed payout regardless on what you sell. They call it a “guarantee”. It used to be whatever you sold was what you earned. Now they give the guarantee so that they don’t have to pay out too much. Even if you perform it’s very difficult to surpass the guarantee. Feels like they are forcing you to leave money on the table. 

The biggest negative I got from the company was how poorly they treat their top performers. Instead of giving them a pat on the back and a thank you, they start investigating you and look for any flaw or inconsistencies in your sales method to get you fired. Simply because they don’t wanna pay high salaries to top earners.
I have seen many great sales reps leave the company because of how poorly they were treated.

","The were always being adjusted to make it harder to meet monthly goal. This creates burnout and it’s hard to maintain after a while. 70% of the floor had FMLA for intermittent use and the other 30% were new and oblivious to the trick to meeting metrics. For example, the veterans work as many hours as possible and take as many calls as possible the first 2 to 3 weeks and then mysteriously become ill the last week by using their FMLA they don’t incur points because of attendance. In doing this it increases the numbers, thus inflated performance metrics. It’s a major issue so in my opinion the company forces turnover to weed out most of the veterans. By having an ever revolving door of new employees, the company can mold them As though they are minions but eventually the new employees catch on to the tricks and become veterans and so on and so forth.

","Queue is never accurate, you're always taking other departments calls and don't typically have the tools to resolve other departments issues so then you end up transferring which reflects on your scores.

There's other supervisors in Mobile micromanaging or drinking on the job. Your stats are always a pain point because they make it impossible to keep them at a good score. This company has done so much damage to my life mentally and physically and I can't wait till I can escape.

All expenses paid training downtown Philadelphia. High end hotel, flights, live music every day in the corporate cafeteria on the top floor of the building. You’ll really fell like you made it. 

Really great training program. Especially if you’re new to cold sales. They’ll teach you from the ground up how to build rapport and gain trust with your clients and best practices for closing the deal and setting expectations.

Free or heavily discounted home Xfinity services.
","Then once it all done you be headed into the office ready to take on the world. Only problem is, half that world hates your guts and the other half are already your customers and they hate your guts too. 

Certain markets are very heavily saturated so drumming up business can be very difficult hence the high turnover rate. Once you start to gain traction they’ll advise you to start getting partners in other industries to start using the referral program. Biggest problem with that is their referral program is incredibly picky about who they will and won’t pay referral money too.

First starting off you’ll be limited on the size of business you can talk to and the products you can sell. So even if you drum up some business there is a good chance you’ll have to pass it off to someone else and only get paid a $150 lead bonus if it closes.
Advice to Management
