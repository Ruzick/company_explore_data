We also only receive a single, small, non-merit based raise per year.

It's probably due to having to bend over and take whatever Amazon dishes out because CBRE is the contractor, but try and convince them, and yourselves, to use logic in what they do. Everything is such of mess of half-planned ideas that are forced upon everyone before they're really proven to be useful. Let people work from home because it will burn less fossil fuels, help to reduce traffic, improve the moral of your employees, improv production for those employees, and it will help to reduce the number of dead bodies being thrown on the pile because of Covid.

-Some great colleagues!

-Great if you want a corporate job.
","-Pay is very low compared to similar jobs in the industry and raises / promotions are hard to come by.

-Not much room for growth unless you want to move out of your field. If you are placed in a property, you are typically the only person on your team so you are stuck in the same role until you leave or change positions.

-No team building opportunities - only the management team has happy hours, outings, social channel interactions. I would've thought that COVID was going to bring our team together and give us more opportunity to work closely, but we have been given no opportunities for any team bonding or relationship building. No gifts for the holidays from CBRE or management, no coffee gift cards or care packages, and no little perks to make our day better while working through a stressful year. These things were VERY common for most other employers to implement this year to show their appreciation for their employees, and CBRE was a huge let down.

I was expecting a better culture from a department thats literal job is to ""deliver unexpected delight"". 

-COVID has been a nightmare at every CBRE property. Honestly there isn't much regard for peoples' health and safety as each site has different protocols. Most property management employees have been forced to go into the office every day in the middle of the pandemic. Not many opportunities to work from home and you are made to feel guilty if you do express your concerns or do come in contact with COVID and report it.

-The training / onboarding process was horrible - not even sure if I got an orientation, and all of my colleagues were equally as confused.

Fri Oct 16 2020, Senior Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,World class real estate company with floundering technology organisation,1,"1. CBRE is the best commercial real estate company in the world. If you are interested in commercial real estate this is the place you want to be.

2. Company has been around for over 100 years, so its easily the most stable big real estate company. Paychecks are reliable. 

3. The companies revenue growth since the Trammell Crow acquisition has been huge. The current CEO Bob and his leadership team have been instrumental in moving the company within striking distance of the Fortune 100. Can't argue with results like that.

4. The Seattle and NYC technology product development teams are easily some of the most capable and talented people I have ever worked with.
","For context I worked in the Digital and Technology / IT division; CBRE is huge so experiences will vary a lot by job role and location.

1. Over the last five years or so the D&T division was globally built up rapidly with limited planning or coordination with the wider company. Many but not all projects started with good intentions but lost focus on our users needs and have extremely low adoption as a result. Because of the high cost of investment the rest of the company is not happy with the results and everyone knows it. This has created a culture in D&T of extreme top down micromanagement that make it nearly impossible to make progress on customer outcomes due to constantly shifting priorities. The leadership is now scrambling to adapt and is not willing to take feedback from teams on the ground.

2. My former department was split between New York City and Seattle and collectively built some of the most highly adopted and well liked user centered technology products in the CBRE. In the last year a new set of D&T middle management came in and laid off half the department and outsourced work to a team of contractors in India. This was all before Covid19. Over the next nine months another 25% of the team left voluntarily (including me), because the new middle management team has been making decisions about product direction and team staffing that are so far in the wrong direction that our best option was to find new jobs during a pandemic induced recession. Now the team is wildly understaffed and the same middle management team that made all these decisions are shocked the team is struggling to produce and has low moral. And I felt like they were blaming our department for that outcome.
Advice to Management
I see two paths to making real progress in technology at CBRE:

1. Remove the middle management tiers in D&T and empower product teams to work directly with end users and geographic/LOB leaders . Drop all the products that don't have ~50% of the possible user base or more in the product at least once a month.

2. Buy a few start-ups and let them do their jobs uninterpreted. I recommend to the CEO that the company buy VTS and Reonomy regardless of the high cost and further invest in their products to transform the company and the industry.

Regardless focus on the core needs of our internal and external users. Ask them what they need to be more effective and give it to them. The rest is a distraction.

","GWS sector needs to integrate more with other areas of the business. The amount of times I interacted outside of GWS/PE team and people asked what we do or didn't know anyone I worked with, etc. was astounding. Heard the comment ""GWS is from a different breed"" and they were not wrong.

I also didn't love how they handled lay-offs with COVID. I was let go one morning after being told ""we have nothing to worry about, the company has been preparing"". At 10pm that night was when they sent out an email saying to expect lay-offs - after it had already happened. And my manager and HR person called me and essentially read from a script. It was highly impersonal compared to what they could have done with a zoom call.

My training was next to nothing and, despite being up front about my experience in the industry, I was almost expected to learn everything overnight.

I had two 1:1 conversations with my boss across the country (which I initiated), though in our interview she said she sets up monthly 1:1s.

","The work that’s bid on is drudgery. Management who bids on the work don’t understand what it takes to get the job done so tasks are underbid and we are always understaffed but the workers are directed to brainstorm ways for us to get more done. Management has little to no leadership experience/skills and create chaos with their lack of organization and inability to provide direction because they don’t know how to do the job themselves. Pay is low compared to same job titles in the region. The office environment is oppressive and we’re micromanaged and treated like children. Job descriptions are generic so management can assign you any task they want, regardless of your job title. Leadership is exploitive and readily accepts accolades for the accomplishments of others.
Advice to Management
Don’t hire people who have worked anywhere else, that way the won’t have any expectations of their leadership or the tasks assigned to them. Too many promoted beyond their capabilities - leadership roles should not be given to those who have simply endured. Mandate professional management training to those promoted rather than leaving the employees under them to “suffer”. The “anonymous” questions that are sent out weekly are ineffective - nothing changes, nothing improves.

Tue Jul 28 2020, Financial Analyst,,Former Employee ,Avoid the Affordable Housing Group (LIHTC) at all costs,4,"None. I’m not writing none as an exaggeration. I’m writing none because there is absolutely no reason any normal, decent, and capable human being should choose to work at a place like this.
","I don’t quite know where to begin. Let’s just say the Affordable Housing (LIHTC) group is the most dysfunctional group of people you will ever encounter in your life. I’m sure the rest of CBRE corporation is fine but this group that got acquired by CBRE a few years back has its own toxic culture that in any normal company would have been reported as illegal.

- toxic, gossipy, immature coworkers: I have never worked at a place that feels more like middle school than actual middle school such as this group. People have nothing better to do so rather they talk about each other and spread rumors behind people’s back. The most soul-sucking place ever because even if you don’t want drama, drama just comes to you. This stems from the fact that there is no diversity in this group. They hire a bunch of frat boys and former college athletes with the most close-minded minds and like to act superior who, chances are, were bullies back in the day and never grew up from that. Then there’s also the underdog that try way too hard to fit in and are willing to feed into the gossip so they can feel included. Literally a bunch of followers. 

- everyone is overworked and underpaid without knowing that they are. When they first give you the job offer, they’d lowball you as much as possible and quote “you won’t add any value in the first year.” As soon as you start, they hold you to impossible standards and start making you feel like you underperform, pressuring you to ramp up at a pace that’s not what you expected. This way they can keep you at the same level forever and not have to promote you. This stems from bad hiring methods. During the hiring process, they don’t have clear processes to identify good candidates because they completely hire people based on stereotypes and bias.

- absolutely no advancement: there will be a ceiling and not just in terms of titles, but also in terms of learning and growth. As an analyst, you practically do the same thing you do 10 years later no matter what your title is now. Your peers elsewhere already make managers and have direct reports. You still are, not to be harsh, an analyst no matter what they call you.

- the work is absolutely irrelevant: do not be fooled by the title “financial analyst”. These guys and girls aren’t doing traditional corporate finance or fp&a or anything like that. It’s purely LIHTC underwriting which is the most niche area even within the real estate world. Folks who work there for too long get stuck aka “pigeonholed” and can’t find jobs elsewhere. Even if you get out early, it’s still hard to find another job having background in this random field. Avoid at all costs if you care about your career potential.

- this is the type of place that attracts lawsuits because of however many workplace rules it breaks everyday (sexual harassment, hostile environment, racial discrimination, etc.). If you are a normal human being, please do not involve yourself here. This place is hidden by the CBRE name so you won’t ever see reviews about it unless you dig up reviews from before it was acquired (read reviews for “tax credit group of marcus and milichap”). Do yourself a favor, save yourself time and mental energy by not even considering to work here. CBRE itself even hired management consultants to help try salvage the culture and morale of this group but don’t bother. If they want the culture to change, they might as well fire all the people that are working there right now.
Advice to Management
The management for this LIHTC group is lost cause, so my advice to CBRE management is: sell off this group. They are incapable of being a seemingly normal place to work at. If you care about your ratings and rankings, SELL OFF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUP.

I was completely fooled during the interview process. The leaders of the marketing team promised multiple things that never came to fruition during the interview.

The team structure was completely unorganized, the process of the workflow was repetitive/unnecessary, and worst of all my manager had no experience in the specialty she was managing.

","CBRE is the absolute WORST company you can work for. You are not valued here through hard work, but by favoritism. If you work overtime and past your regular 40 hours a week, your work ethic is not acknowledged and praised. Regardless of the networking and connections you make throughout the office and across regional and various divisions, all decisions are solely based on your boss, even when unethical. 

I have seen hard work get overlooked by favoritism of an employee who barely works, has minimal skills fit for the title of their role, and is not a team player. This person who was not fit for the role was promoted many times within a short time frame. 

The benefits are terrible. Health insurance is absurdly overpriced.

Budget cuts occur too often.

Too much power is left in the hands of clients and does not show the Company caring for employees.

You can be terminated at any time if your executive decides they want you gone, even if your performance is exceptional. They very much stand behind the ""employment at will"" clause that says you can be let go for no reason. I saw amazing assistants get fired left and right - it creates a terrible sense of paranoia that you're next and you should basically have your resume ready to go at any time. 

The performance expectations are unrealistic and not attainable - you basically need to be a psychic mind reader and dedicate your entire life 24/7 to the job. It is completely normal to work 12-14 hour days, 6 days a week for the entire team and only go home to sleep and change clothes. You will eat all of your meals here, you will have zero work life balance and your health will absolutely decline. Its a running joke among the admins on what ailments will happen to any new assistants hired because it is a real thing. 

The pay is excellent, mostly because of all the overtime but don't expect a large bonus, certainly no where near the level the other team members get even though you do most of the actual work on deals. 

Its a thankless job that will drain the life out of you and leave you with no time to date, see friends or family, exercise, travel or ANYTHING that you enjoy because when you do get rare time away from the office you are so exhausted that you basically go into a coma. 

Also, CBRE instituted a new communication hierarchy where instead of your boss discussing things with you directly, they now will tell an HR rep who then has a meeting with you to relay the information. You then go back and forth a hundred times because you aren't allowed to receive corrective conversations directly from your superior. However, because of this - your opinions are never really taken into consideration and explanations don't make sense because the HR rep isn't aware of what actually happened. You're basically just told to improve this or that but in very vague terms like ""be more proactive"", improve your ""ability to anticipate any future scheduling needs that may arise in real time"" and ""personal assistance to an executive should now also extend to their family, staff and others deemed as VIP"". 

It's the worst place I've ever worked in 20 years and leaving there was by far the best decision of my life.
Advice to Management
Understand that employees need to feel valued and actually be valued. Executive's success is in a large part due to the person at their right hand side, so assistant's needs and concerns should be listed to. If you demand that they dedicate their lives to your company then at least provide some on-site perks like a yoga studio or fitness area, nap pods, meal stipends, etc. Assistant's should get a generous bonus based in part on their Executive's sales - if a broker is making $21 BILLION a year in sales, then yeah their EA absolutely deserves a bonus of .000002 % of that. Also, if you have the same role constantly having turnover, then recognize that the problem isn't the 20 assistants that were in that position, its the executive. 

It's 2019 - why do you still only have 5 women in leadership roles when you have over 90,000 employees? Stop being part of the problem.

Tue Aug 20 2019, Occupancy Planner,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee ,"CBRE is a real estate advisory firm, a vendor to its client",5,"This review is specially for global workplace services on the Microsoft account. Not all accounts are the same. 

Microsoft relies heavily on CBRE to carry out their real estate services and the partnership is strong and positive. As a vendor, you get immense exposure to perhaps one of the greatest companies of the world; learning best practices in the industry. The pure scale of the account is fascinating and the experience will be invaluable to your career. Nice people on the account are great, and they will care for your growth. Once you get into the account, there are many different teams and options. 

Work-life balance is good for the most part because management is extremely flexible. Many people leave in the afternoon to pick up their kids from school or whatnot, and finish up emails at home. There is no WFH policy, so it is very acceptable as long as you get your work done.
","Structurally, they operate from the typical, old-fashion, top-down approach where ""senior"" positions have all of the authority and avoids 2-way communication. In short, managers talk down to you because they're not incentivized to be nice. 

The benefits are crappy, to say the least. I opted out of health insurance because the contributions are unusually high for such a large company. Sick days & PTO are the same, and they must be accrued. You begin with zero. Unless you make over $100k, then you are granted more leeway with PTO. 

Employees privately discuss how low their compensation is compared to industry standards in the same city. You must look after yourself and what your starting compensation is as it will dictate your long term comp over time, even with vertical movement. 

If they promise you movement during the interview, take it with a grain of salt. If you do well in your position, they would rather have you stay there because finding a backfill is more work for them. Be proactive and be intentional about movement if that's what you want.
Advice to Management
There needs to be an overhaul with employee evaluation. Not providing the opportunity for reportees to also evaluate their managers creates restlessness and eliminates morale that a strong team needs to succeed. It feels like stakeholders do not prioritize employee input on decisions that should be collaborative. Not really sure why the turnover rate is not a wake-up call to the organization?

- Depending upon on your team, you may get a reasonable manager (I've had over 5 managers in the 5+ years I've been here)
","- Upper management (includes directors and above) lack transparency
- Upper management will not fire bad managers or employees for that matter. They prefer to put you somewhere you don't like, dog you to death and then hope you quit.
- High employee turnover
- Lack of diversity. Having lots of employees from India is not diversity. The two biggest minorities in the DFW area are Blacks and Hispanics and I've only seen a handful (I can count them on my hands...literally less than 10) in IT. 
- Lots of movement (between floors, buildings and even cities lately) so where you get hired to work may not be the same in a year or two. Management also does NOT take employee input into consideration when it comes to location.
- Capital One employees hired at senior levels. That's where CTO is from so she has hired in her puppets that do her bidding (read: they don't represent YOU; they represent HER)
- A bias among upper managers for Amazon's Cloud over Azure despite the fact that we WERE mostly a .NET shop before they arrived. It's the hammer they know from their Capital One days and its the business that suffers with all the chaotic movement (very few features...just a lot of technology changes from their prospective).
Advice to Management
- Fire the CTO and all her upper staff. 
- You need to be concerned about the culture that you are fostering by hiring in folks rather than training and promoting from within. Hiring outside kills culture (ask Merrill Lynch). Every time we get a new CTO, things are flipped on their head and most of them are concerned about making a mark for themselves rather than taking care of the needs of the businesses we support. 
- If you have special initiatives you want to push (security, DR, etc.), you should hire people that go around to help teams meet those demands.
- Set incentives for managers to support existing applications. This could be based on keeping the software at the latest version (upgrading npm packages and software frameworks) and/or all Docker images with latest OS installed or even upgrading the look and feel to be more modern. Whatever it takes to keep the lights on rather than being solely focused on new capital projects.
- Learn how to fire abusive managers that are toxic to groups. How many employees have to leave before you understand that a manager needs to be fired?
- Do exit interviews with employees and contractors that leave abruptly. 
- Fire managers that have a notoriously bad reputation among multiple employees.

","Not a real maintenance job. Your job will entail carrying out BS tasks for Amazon operations that are either completely ridiculous, or something that they can complete themselves, but would rather put it on maintenance... like cleaning their grill for a 4th of July cookout (yes, that really happened). CBRE management has no backbone and lets Amazon walk all over us with these mindless tasks by saying “yes” to EVERYTHING. The job consists of probably less than 10% real maintenance that entails repairing equipment, less that 1% actually troubleshooting and solving problems, and the rest consists of, moving desks, cleaning grills, cutting legs on tables because they’re too tall?, and attempting to baby-proof the facility because Amazon will not hold their own employees accountable for behavioral issues. This is where careers come to die. Also, on top of all that... the health insurance is extremely expensive and absolutely terrible.

-Easiest job I've ever had
-Great team of coworkers and leadership.
-Lots of opportunities to grow within CBRE
","-Pay is not equal between all receptionists. If you do extra projects you are not paid more so there is no incentive to do extra work. Leadership will not let you negotiate for a raise. You get a raise once a year if you do well on your review, but at most you'll see a $0.60 raise.
-Leadership does not communicate well at all. There are about 10 supervisors, and they do not seem to communicate with each other. You ask them all the same question and you get a million different answers. Upper leadership seems to be out of touch with what we actually do at reception, and they don't communicate well to the supervisors who report to them. Some supervisors do not communicate well with their direct reports too. They try to check in once a week, but sometimes you won't see them for weeks and can't get a hold of them.
-Leadership does not ask for receptionists' opinions ever, but especially before making decisions/changes, so sometimes they'll change a policy/procedure and it won't make sense.
Advice to Management
-Get the opinions/feedback from receptionists more often. A lot of them don't feel heard. Explain reasoning for decisions that are made, and welcome feedback.
-Work on communication between upper leadership, supervisors, and receptionists. If there is a policy/procedure change, upper leadership should send out a mass communication...because when they rely on the supervisors to pass info along it becomes a game of telephone and everyone hears something different or interprets it differently.

","1. Nonexistent employee startup/ramp-in/training - you're on your own buddy - bring your own computer, monitors, peripherals, etc., as it will take them months to purchase your company hardware.
2. Some of the poorest employee management I have seen in my 30+ years managing people - from the managing Director up several levels to the executive ranks. Children playing with a toy...
4. No leadership in sight, and they didn't want me (former VP of several large companies) to provide any recommendations or comment - they know it all...
5. No management of client. Whatever client wants, we provide, regardless of time, money, impacts, etc.
6. Poor treatment of employees. My staff and I, all seasoned and successful professionals, were viewed as lowly beings, and just needed to do as we were told, regardless how ridiculous or infantile the request/demand was.
7. NO communication. No standardized meetings to coordinate/organize staff, projects, processes, etc. What meetings existed were often not attended, cancelled, or cut short.
8. Micromanagement - Unbelievable. My staff and I are all in our mid fifties or older and extremely capable, particularly if left alone to work. If I need my hand held, I'll visit my mom.
8. Work/Life balance - what's that ???

","One of the downsides to working for CBRE from my personal experience is as a Black woman I have had challenges when applying for Management positions. Me like some other Black women in the company - I can only speak for Digital and Technology Department quite often find ourselves having to file complaints through HR to be treated fairly. Although CBRE considers themselves to be a Diverse company, it seems to not be evenly dispersed when it comes to Blacks vs other minority races. Promotions are usually based on the buddy system.

I would suggest that some sort of regulation be put in place with regard to commission splits. It should be consistent across the entire marketing department.

Also, some steps should be taken to reduce the need for overtime work on a regular basis - whether that be hiring an additional marketing specialist to lighten the workload, set some boundaries with regard to what the teams can request of their marketing specialist, etc.

","Lack of corporate oversight into how new employees are hired and on-boarded has led to high turnover and team dissatisfaction. 

Intra-team infighting, stemming from leadership, and leadership's inability to manage its human capital is causing the project deliverables to fall short. 

Awful in-house e-learning and online training offerings.

Non-existent on-boarding is ridiculous. 

Favoritism and 'old-boy' network at play. Lack of transparency between management and line works. They keep so much to themselves - old school management technique is antiquated in this day and age. 

Lack for respect in diversity of thought and experience on the part of management causes good ideas to get lost or dismissed outright. Gender bias is also at play.
