Wed Jan 13 2021, Project Manager,,Current Employee ,Great Place to Work,0,"Competitive salary and benefits, sincere desire for and openness too improvements of all kinds, whether it's systems, processes, or solutions. 

Great place to grow if you are motivated and willing to exert effort. Company owns a lot of other operating companies, so room to move to those organizations as opportunities occur. There is a lot of promotion and movement within. 

There are some incredibly smart, interesting and kind people working here. I've found it easy to build rapport. 
Job security is good, but you must be prepared for changes to staff around you - it can sometimes feel like someone is always leaving/arriving. 
Like the new CEO so far. 
Lots of progress has been made on Diversity and Inclusion and plans for more.
","Some people feel overworked, so for some life/work balance could be an issue. There is use of contractors, and those folks get paid less and have significantly less in terms of benefits, time off, etc. Headcount is kept tight, so it can be hard to convert unless 1. your boss fights for you and 2. they have justification to add a headcount. 
Not a con, but like every organization, your boss matters a lot in terms of your experience. Make sure you communicate early on working style and make sure it's a good match for your career and personality.
Advice to Management
Include more work balance conversations with leaders around the organization. Continue to push D&I so people will feel welcome and included. 

Try to improve offerings for contractors - yes, it's expensive but they are part of our success as an organization too. Please put some Black and brown people on the Board.

No supervisor or management available during these hours. Management didn't care about the employees. They allowed an employee who was not scheduled to work come on the property and come inside the plant to start a fight with a lead person who quit because they were written up because of the confrontation which they avoided and brushed off. I have never worked for a company that allowed someone to come on company property and not scheduled to work to start a fight and not get fired! Only a write up!!! Management only cares about their well being and numbers and nothing else! Company awarded a grant and instead of giving company raises they remodeled bathrooms and built a gym!!! Why????

The DBSO representatives are sent out from East Coast and Europe. Their interactions demotivate employee idea generation and squash internal innovation. They do not take the time to understand the culture of motivation factors a the Opco's but demoralize the existing management views. The formal training programs have some useful tools but do not use relative examples that apply to the Opco's. The instructors read from prepared scripts and are not able to fulfill the training with relevant or applicable advice. When I asked why - that was ""By design"" - just communicate the message dont worry about relevancy. The office is stretched thin, they provide a few training classes and do not follow up on effectiveness of the training. Only a select elite amount of people are able to attend.

","Losers: The employees at other facilities at Pall as the massive layoffs began.

Losers: Most of the employees at the former Global headquarters at Port Washington 
, NY Most are or already have been laid off.

Losers: The talented lab personnel that all lost their jobs at PW as the jobs and the lab talent did not move to other facilities. The lab talent was managed out the front door to the unemployment line.

Losers: The customers who now will have to wait for newly hired trainee lab personnel from other facilities to come up to speed for the testing protocols they are now just learning (usually a 6 month process at best) and These newly trained personnel are dealing with a heavy back log of tests to perform as they are replacing many labs and the work load those labs performed.

Losers: LI as when the final person exits the PW facility the area will have lost in total hundreds of jobs, And the money these people will have spent on LI as well as the tax base Pall corp has brought to LI for over 70 years.

Losers: Any LI person who might have landed a job at Pall if the Acquisition had not gone through.
Advice to Management
Be more honest during acquisition. When asked if there would be lay-offs and if the facility would be closing be honest. Treat the employees with respect and give them the time line. Then everyone is on the same page and the transition of work will go very smooth to the other sites where the work will now be done. This would have given everyone a 6 month heads up and a chance to find suitable employment over a 6 month period maybe even within the company itself and pay out an extra bonus for people who stay the 6 months, this will say the company money over the long haul. This helps both the employer with a smooth transition between work load and work site and does not flood the market with former employees now all scrambling to find suitable employment. Stop, Act and Speak up upper management walk the talk. Do what you say and say what you do.

Also China did not cause Good paying jobs to be lost. It is American companies through Acquisition of other companies that eliminate good paying jobs to squeeze more profit out of already profitable companies that have caused and continue to cause the fading middle class as the rich get richer and the good jobs evaporate. Corporate Greed has all but eliminated the middle class

- Can be quite competitive; not always a bad thing.
- For tech companies (like Fluke, TekComms, Arbor, VSS, Teletrac or even radically consider all OpCos) DHR really should consider granting equity as part of the overall comp and retention package to all fulltime exempt employees.

A modicum of competence and a nod to the DBS quality system is all you need if you know how to play the game and are willing to burn your bridges as you go.
","I worked for many years for a foreign owned company that was purchased by Dananher. They let us operate as per past practices for a while, and we continued to be highly successful, but eventually their management insisted on imposing their will. After 18 months of their serious meddling, it’s a wonder the company is still in business.

Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours sum up most of Danaher’s real culture. Generally speaking, it is a pressure cooker and all communication is one directional – top down. Any attempt to streamline, impact change, or even discuss a better way to do anything is strictly frowned upon when it comes from the bottom. Work longer/harder, don't complain or try to fix any of the myriad broken systems or processes, and don't forget that there are 10 people lined up outside to take your spot (your manager certainly won't forget). 

The DBS quality system is a joke. Don’t get me wrong, theoretically it has many outstanding qualities. Unfortunately, the company is operated by ruthless, ladder climbing, management-by-spreadsheet types who have neither the time nor the inclination to learn let alone properly apply the myriad processes. “Whatever worked once will work again” is the prevailing attitude, and a one-size-fits-all solution is forced on everything.

All of the talk about growth, best practices, and competition is just that… idle talk. Ultimately, the Danaher business model is not one of retain and reinvest. It is the same old downsize and distribute, cut your way to profitability, do anything to meet/beat analysts’ expectations on your stock price management style that pervades the entire venture capital culture.

None to date. Complete downgrade compared to most companies. I guess you could say ""its better than nothing, then again, maybe not.

Weeks after the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, they announced an 8% reduction of all employees. Even departments that are already low on personnel are losing bodies. Our benefits were cut nearly in half and the Danaher prefered medical plan is outright an insult. United Health Care, for those of you familiar with United, I dont have to explain any more. 

Its obvious that Danahers intent is to squeeze Beckman Coulter for every drop its worth and do it in a very unappreciated manner. It s just a matter of time before they weed out the best employees and are left with people of the lowest morale. Within a few years the superb quality of Beckman Coulter products will be an old memory, and so will the family atmospere that filled most of our offices.

Experts at manufacturing and optimization of manufacturing space. Danaher is very process driven company. Employees with MBA's from prestigious programs (e.g. Harvard MBA programs) are highly sought after and usually move up in the corporate ladder very rapidly. It is common to see MBA new hires move to a executive positions within 24 months.
","If one is hired by Danaher and does not have a prestigious MBA, the employees rarely go anywhere. Promotions are exceptionally rare, regardless of accomplishment. Only executive staff receives promotions and / or bonuses. This company in Loveland was acquired by Danaher approximately 10 years ago and Danaher has consistently stripped company assets and benefits to meet the most recent numbers short term. The profit/revenue numbers are the bottom line for everything, and the treatment of employees is of trivial importance. Over the past 10 years since the Danaher acquisition, employees have lost vacation time, lost performance bonuses, have had their retirement plans stripped by 75%, pay more in medical premiums and co-pays, have been required to take numerous furloughs, eliminated corporate sponsored education programs and rarely if ever reward for good work. Please refer to a recent Business Week article that rates the Danaher retirement plans as the worst in the industry. When compensation increases are given, they are never to the level of the cost of living. It is truly a team effort to make the numbers, but there is no incentive to stay. Employee moral is very poor and it gets worse every year.

","If you are reading this because your company was recently acquired by Danaher, that's unfortunate. The next step is basically to strip you down as far as possible in order to achieve higher profits. Expect any ""above-average"" benefits your previous employer had to diminish over time. This includes pay raises (none with the current economy, minimal otherwise), bonuses (formulas to calculate will likely change to lower payout) , ESPP programs (non-existent) , restricted stock grants (only for *very* select individuals), etc. Basically any non-essential compensation should be removed.

Danaher has an unparalleled ability to transform a good likable company into one that's despised by the majority of its employees. ""Associates"" are treated as expensive liabilities instead of valued assets. Unfortunately this model works very well for increasing operating profit, at the expense of the underlying individuals making it happen.

","The company cares most the stock price. No career development unless you are managers. Employees are used as cheap labour, no matter how skilled you are. Don't believe what they say. They're trying to squeeze out the last drop from you. All they care about is to have a good looking bottom line and rise their stock price. They should change their business to stock trading. I don't buy a sing share of this company, even though it won't affect them at all, because I don't believe a high-tech company who don't value innovation and its employees and customers. The company changes its organisation structure frequently, makes people feel insecure. They love inorganic growth. If one business is not doing good, just sell it and buy a new one. They believe so much in that management, not hard-working people, can create new technologies.

Wed Apr 02 2014,,"Toronto, ON",Current Employee ,"Huge potential. Too much short term focus on sales, no true organic growth",9,"If you want to learn business systems, this is the place to be. Danaher is very effective at what I call the firm processes such as manufacturing. procurement, quality, and even sales to some extent. 

The people are great (but moral is poor)
","Danaher does poorly with, excuse the term, fuzzier processes such as innovation and organic product development. My belief is that there are flaws with some of the concepts behind the DBS system. One of the concepts appears to be that anyone or any team can be made to fit a role with the appropriate DBS tool and training. To some extent, that is true. Virtually anyone can be taught to swim, or to play a musical instrument. So, while anyone can be taught the tools, you get mediocre performance from mediocre skill. There is little or no attempt to highlight and assist the people that are excellent in their roles, at least at the innovation level. Managers of these people may get noticed, but they are not the innovators. 

Danaher is not, in my experience, a company where skills and contribution are valued more than being a manager. There is no balance re specialists, SME's, etc. If you are not a manager it is hard to get your voice heard. Your viewpoint may be heard if you are fortunate enough to have a boss who brings your voice forward and does not take credit for it. , A boss that does this though does it sometimes at their own peril. 

Danaher managers are not 'people' managers, even the better ones. They tend to try to project and micro manage. Who is managing the people? There is no real career path planning, no training for new roles, no mentoring (again unless you are lucky). A wise person once told me ""good managers give their people the tools knowledge and resources to get the job done, and then let them do their job"". No micromanagement in that.

Danaher focuses much too closely on maximizing profit to shareholders. This myopic view has the effect of having everyone lose sight of the other aspects of growing the company, i.e. innovation, organic growth, etc.. Forget about suggesting 2 year or longer projects even if you have the very lucrative business cases to back them up. Managers like the idea of doing these projects, however they are being driven very hard by their managers to increase weekly and quarterly profits.
Advice to Management
1) Examine truly successful innovation driven companies that grow primarily through internal organic growth. Buying companies is not organic growth. 
2) Determine who your key non-management people are, you have a lot of them that are underutlized, bored and frustrated
3) take your learning's from 1) and 2) and implement action plans based on what you have learned.
4)Yes, sales are important, but they are to any company. Focus more on the rest of the business and sales will go up as a result.

The above would be a good start

The reviewer from 10/12/2011 hit the nail on the head. Managers make false promises of hope to employees and rules with fear. As managers we're trained to exaggerate these elements to milk every last ounce of energy from employees without paying for it. Title ""raises"" are common way to evade pay rewards. When managers have an issue with a direct report, even if trivial, they'll likely go on a witch hunt and build their case against that employee (e.g. 15min late twice becomes ""perpetual tardiness"" and unable to finish an arduous assignment given only a day prior becomes ""unwilling and unable to perform essential responsibilities"") so that HR can take over and apply the coup de grace. Mind you, this applies to managers as well, so your living motto becomes ""to kill or be killed.""

These are some elements that really turned my stomach, and made me rethink who I want to be in an environment where I am required to spend most of my waking hours. I have come to the realization that this isn't normal or temporary, and that it's something that I'll eventually look back on with profound regret. The reviews here have inspired me to come forward, as their examples are striking in their accuracy and resonance, considering how many Danaher companies there are throughout the world.

Questionable practices
Unfair discipline among employees

Advice to Management
You cannot build a successful business when there is a crack in the foundation. Danaher is inherently flawed and it starts with the executive team and trickles down. There is such a huge focus on profit while sacrificing and ignoring the needs of the people. Human capital is the greatest resources any company could have.
