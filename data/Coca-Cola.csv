Good healthcare options and good severance benefits (that second part may be changing however in 2021)

The company always maintains an excellent focus on diversity and inclusion just through it's company culture without needing to have endless internal meetings or trainings about diversity and inclusion.
","Upper level leadership can be very inconsistent in supporting initiatives and ensuring funding is available.
The company has undergone two major restructurings in the past 3 years theoretically to reduce job redundancies though often breaking up lines of communication and leaving some responsibilities unaccounted for.
Developmental opportunities for trying new job roles are inconsistent on whether they are actually developmental or just a department getting some cheap help without the intention of offering permanent roles for successful developmental employees.
Advice to Management
Trying too hard to follow a Silicon valley type ""fail faster"" approach leads to abandoned projects or work that is done too quickly or sloppily to really pay off just to avoid getting cut. Don't go for fad approaches to management but instead be more deliberate about both what gets initial support (including considering the possibility of expanded costs over time) and what gets cut (focusing on finding evidence of whether something is a real dead end or just hitting speed bumps).

I have been working at The Coca-Cola Company full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Co-workers are great. Flexibility is also very good if you have the right manager.
Cons
Too much change. I get a new manager on average every 6 months. Can’t establish any continuity or get any momentum. It’s kind of insane, actually. Changing again now. They just fired my manager after 1 year on the job when everything is going very well. No explanation — and looking externally. Again, no explanation. It’s very disheartening. I was very positive on James Q until recently. I think he’s grasping at straws due to COVID.
Advice to Management
Give people a chance to be successful! Constantly changing every 6 months is not helping.

The Atlanta campus has a lot of great amenities including an onsite doctor, pharmacy, dry cleaner, stores, and coffee shops.
","Compensation has never been amazing, but recent changes have made it even harder for employees to reach long term incentives like stock options which are common at similar companies like The Home Depot. Also receiving a raise even for a promotion leaves you with a cap of 15% increase which is not great if you were already low on the comp chart. Also 401k contributions have recently been reduced. The constant restructuring is also very disruptive and stressful.
Advice to Management
Compensate talent competitively at all levels, not just senior management. Stock options motivate employees to care about the long term well being of the company. Our business is a top 50, so its important we benchmark against companies such as Google and Facebook, not only lower performing manufacturing companies like P&G, especially when our business is primarily marketing in North America.

-Decent job experience if you know how to seek it out
-Free Coke products (duh)
-Very nice facilities, including on-site gym, pharmacy, and medical office
","-Aggressively competitive company culture, to the point where junior members are obviously trying to undercut each other even within teams, rather than trying to work together for the team's better good
- Cliquey culture which is encouraged by senior leadership as it keeps teams from sharing information and keep information silos necessary for senior leadership to maintain control
-Junior members are expected to work overtime and long hours, etc to show ""dedication"" to company while senior members get constant work from home/PTO/breaks, etc.
-Senior leadership constantly changing (I went through 3 managers in a two year period) and therefore, priorities constantly changing, projects constantly starting then stopping, initiatives are proposed and then quickly abandoned.
-It's about how long you've been there and whether you've sucked up to the people in charge that month.
-Zero loyalty to employees. Even people with 25+ years of experience will get the boot with zero regard to their contributions, as long as it'll help the bottom line and the senior management get a bigger paycheck. 
-As a junior member, you're expected to suck up and work yourself to the bone and be happy with the measly paycheck and zero recognition. They also leave you out of the loop constantly without regard.
-With all the resources at their disposal, these are put towards initiatives like mimicking other companies' formulas, instead of developing innovative products and business models to save an outdated business model and product. It's a sinking ship and they know it and are scrambling to try to fix it, to little avail.
-Zero upward mobility for junior members unless someone quits, dies, or gets laid off. They rarely promote internally and if they do, it's a ""lateral move"" (i.e.- more responsibility for a 0% raise).
Advice to Management
Value all members of your team and actually reward and recognize team members. Also, actually PAY people well and there won't be constant turnover at the junior levels.

","Where to begin? Morale has been absolutely decimated by the number and frequency of restructurings. So a LOT of company engagement and deep internal knowledge is being lost not just via layoffs, but then again via the demoralized/overworked/under-recognized people left behind who as a result then head out the door themselves. Benefits have been reduced subtly (no cost-of-living salary increases, etc.) and don't compete well with the market. Similarly, salaries are lower than they should be. You are absolutely just a figure contributing to the bottom line. Growth opportunities are limited unless you are very precisely politically aligned with the right people -- and that's fickle.

There’s no true plan of action to address the ongoing problems in this area. The company does a poor job at hiring long term talent.. mostly because they look at it as a revolving door perspective they expect loyalty and commitment but that is not returned.. although salary is somewhat competitive they are not realistic with local cost of living increases and your performance reviews are not based on a individual target but rather a larger scale which may include other department results. Same goes for bonuses. Example if sales or distribution hit a certain number or miss it, this will affect the warehouse bonus..

","They stopped caring about their employees, it is all about the revenue. At least 10 yearly small lay off. They get rid off employees over 40 years old and hire college grads.

Beautiful, shiny campus with free Coke products. Lots of events and swag, if that's important to you. 

If you play politics correctly, you can move around and up quickly. You can learn a lot and make great connections if you work smart (not hard). Looking back at the opportunity I had and the things I learned, a lot of the complaints I had upon leaving are truly not that bad in comparison to other companies.
","If you are promoted quickly, your pay raises are minimal and you end up making a lot less than market/your peers, in spite of being seen as a top performer. 

Traffic can be horrible if you live in the 'burbs, but if your manager is understanding, that can be worked around. 

EXTREMELY political; you absolutely want to know who the power movers actually are (you may be surprised) and get on their good side quickly, otherwise you could find your team/role eliminated without the support you need to find another role internally. 

In the past, mediocrity was tolerated, so people could have long careers in the same role and not feel pressure to learn, move around/up, and stagnate. With the restructuring, that seems to be less and less the case. But obviously, as with all restructurings, management got it wrong frequently and kept average performers, while letting high potential people walk.

Most people in this company spend 80% of their time working on individual leaders’ push for more power and additional money. That’s the job. 
Face it, it’s not a complex business. The ‘business’ is self promotion (Kevin Spacey style). People don’t have enough actual work to do. 
If you like a petty, mean, manipulative, greedy, shallow environment with a lot of horrible people in charge, this would be your place. 
There were some good leaders with integrity, but they were few and far between. 
My manager’s manager called me in to sit in on a teleconference with him (in silence) and he proceeded to outright lie to the other party on the phone, while looking me in the eye. Some kind of disgusting test, I suppose. His behavior was completely fostered by the Sr Exec he reported to.

","When working on projects, no one really wants to hear a realistic assessment of anything. They only want a ""yes it will be done"", regardless of obstacles or issues.

This is not only my experience and perception, but a widespread, known culture, both inside and outside the company. Hopefully this will change over time.

Some Coworkers are Nice
","1) You better know what you're doing the day you show up because training for your job consists of being told ""do the online exercises"".
2) Be prepared to work 24/7 because you are responsible for everything that happens under you all the time. 
3) Lots of Catch-22s. You have to hold the folks accountable for their mistakes, otherwise you get blamed. If you do hold them accountable for enough mistakes, they're gone and you have to hire someone new. Tough to build team chemistry and move in a positive direction when you're having to constantly C.Y.A.
4) Upper Management will say whatever they have to in order for them to look good. They'll dump on you first chance they get to save their own skins. You will get blamed for circumstances that are out of your control, and when you make suggestions to fix them they will be ignored.
5) It's so much fun getting emails and texts at all hours of the day and night about things that either a) could wait until the next morning or b) the answer is so obvious you wonder why they felt the urgent need to wake you up with a question they should already know the answer to.
6) Multiple Unions who's goal seems to be minimum effort for maximum pay. They file grievances over the smallest slight and are experts at playing the ""past precedent"" game.
7) They have no problem running their workers into the ground in order to boost production and make their numbers.
8) When Near-Misses result from overworked employees, upper management is only concerned with avoiding any Lost-Time Accidents. They will find something else for the worker to do, even if it's sitting at a desk shredding papers, to avoid having a Lost-Time Accident.
9) Definitely a suck-up-to-the-boss-to-keep-your-job culture
10) Quality's fine, as long as it doesn't interfere with getting product out the door.

","Once Coca-Cola North America assumed full control of VEB, it went to hell in a hand-basket, and QUICK. So much talent has been dismissed over a phony assessment process. March 15th is our last day. Really, what they did was retain lower skilled workers and got rid of the hard-working ones who put VEB on the map with their tenacity and knowledge of the bottler system. The senior leadership team is a complete fraud and was not at all transparent about the process in which dozens of people would lose their jobs. The company did these bogus assessments where your manager, their manager and then their manager supposedly assessed your skills and talents. The only problem is, they weighted the four categories so your past performance was only like a 10% factor. Past performance was the only category that isn't subjective. You either hit your plan or you didn't. So, if you hit your plan every year consistently but they want to get rid of you for cheaper talent, they can score you lower on the other portions because those are subjective and also carry more weight. They basically crafted the outcomes of the assessments.

No advice for senior management because they are drones for the mother ship, Coca-Cola. You cannot tell them anything because they will not fight for you because they are gutless. They are just glad they aren't the ones getting screwed over.

This company does not give a damn about their people. They only want people who they know they can push around and over-work and under-pay. Honestly, getting laid off was the best thing that could've happened to me.

They also provide tuition reimbursement that is a positive for those seeking a degree. The VP is very nice, talks with everyone, and provides a positive face for Coca-Cola. There are some really hard workers there and passionate about their jobs, career, and succeeding.
","Most of the managers play sabotage games among their team, it really makes no sense to me to want drama or hostile work environment. It really appears most want to pit each other against each other. There is a lot of confidential information shared from management that eventually spills to other departments and effects people's careers, promotions, and well-being. I witnessed this happening many times and the fear of speaking up you become on the list of no further advancement. The expectation of work load is greater than one can complete in a typical workday, majority of salary workers do greater than 10 hours a day and work weekends. Most people advance because they are chosen before the role is posted, and even though others are qualified and meet all requirements including a degree if they have someone in mind there is no changing it even when it states a Manager is required to have a degree. It used to be the place I wanted to retire, the people were united and really had passion because it was a great place to work years ago. I would say if you can deal with working in an unstable hectic corporate environment this could be a great place to work. About every 5 to 6 months they let people go due to the strategy of becoming leaner with less employees.

Great pay if you're a grade 9 or above, and overall good benefits
","Most people think of KO as a beverage company. It's really a marketing/advertising company. Thus the financial investment in updating the public areas of HQ (most of the employee office space is outdated). The bottlers (of which KO has jerked around for YEARS - google the lawsuit) get all of the capital intensive labor and assets associated with bottling and distribution. KO basically sells the concentrate to the bottlers and gets to maximize profit by re-franchising. That was the model before CCE was spun off in the late 80s, and that's what the company has returned to in an effort to return to profitability. The company's cash flow is in serious peril, so the re-franchising and annual layoffs are the company's way of cost-cutting to improved cash flow. And recently, the company changed its comp structure so that most employees will not receive annual merit raises (regardless of performance). KO has coasted on its brand recognition for years, along with Warren Buffett's endorsement (curiously, his son, Howard Buffett, retired from the BOD last year). The stock price is way overvalued, and new CEO Quincey has the arduous task of feigning a company turnaround after Muhtar Kent's poor leadership. KO waited too long to invest and market more of its other brands that would be pleasing to the health-obsessed consumer, and ill-advisedly doubled down on soda, particularly Coke. Quincey is trying to change that, but is probably about 10 years too late. The iceberg beneath the surface has done its damage. Even if it the ship can remain above water, KO can only coast for so long. Godspeed to anyone who doesn't work in sales/marketing or product development - every other department is and will continue to be chess pieces in the on-going saga to keep the company solvent.

","The internal workings can be rather political, so it could depend on who you know, rather than what you know, if you want to get ahead, or get to where you want to be. This could vary based on where you are geographically, as well as functionally. As a large and storied company, when restructuring is undertaken, it is often big and impactful, even if it means negatively impacting ongoing functions. The company is trying hard to diversify its strategic priorities, but there is still a reliance on the success and profitability of its core namesake brand, even in the face of headwinds. In general, the culture is 'do more with less', so it can be long hours and a lot of work.
