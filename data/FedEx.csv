Advice to Management
When choosing who to promote, try to make decisions based on that employee's work ethic, and efficiency, not by how buddy-buddy you are with them. And train your managers to actually help employees when needed, instead of telling them that they are not supposed to touch boxes, and to let packages handlers do everything by themselves. Package handlers could also use breaks, considering how badly they are worked.

Mindless work.
","When working the line, you are required to work at a very fast pace, you need to scan every package that flys by you to find packages for your line. When working in peak season for example, the load of packages every night is immense- working at the pace they do, and the accuracy they demand is not human. Managers constantly walk the line, scanning packages to see which ones weren’t pulled off so they can yell at the person responsible. Other managers also walk on catwalks above the warehouse and yell at you down below, if they notice you slowing down. Peak season is crazy, and FedEx at the location I worked at genuinely did not care if you threw the boxes, regardless if they are fragile. The warehouse I worked at, closed later the next year- no wonder!
Advice to Management
Don’t treat or expect your employees to work like a computer, especially during peak season.

Disapproves of CEO
I have been working at FedEx full-time
Pros
The job can be fun and allows you to be creative at times. 

Teaches you management skills. 

Decent benefits for insurance and PTO
Cons
Work Grueling hours for the Christmas Holiday and get hours cut the rest of the year.

Opportunities for advancement are high but don't expect to get much of a raise for your promotion. 

Expect do the same work as your superiors without a promotion or increased pay. 

Hire in new employees at a higher starting salary than you are currently making, especially if you've been with the company for several years, but won't give you a raise to compensate. 

Basically on call at any time. 

It's very hard to get a decent shift, unless you like to work evenings. 

Shared as an employee with other FedEx Offices all over the district.
Advice to Management
Give your senior staff raises to compete with the rising market. If you keep bumping up the pay for new hires but leave your loyal, long-term, employees in the dust, you're going to lose a lot of talent that you could have kept if you'd just treated them better and made pay more fair.

Advice to Management
Train incoming employees to stack boxes correctly, which will help the flow of the process. 
Find another route for drivers to gather their product because it is a safety matter and dangerous for them to continue driving through the building in the package handlers work area. They drive over merchandise and hit carts as there is no room for trucks in that small space.

Sun Nov 01 2020, Strategic Development Account Executive,"Stamford, CT",Former Employee ,FedEx is a great corporation but has drifted away from their core principles of PSP,3,"FedEx was founded on the principles of People-Service-Profit (PSP). PSP means that if you take care of your people and provide a great service you will make a profit. It's great to work for a company that values their people. FedEx has great people. FedEx's lives by ""the Purple Promise"": I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. The Purple Promise is an Excellent Mantra and business ""Golden Rule"". Working sales at FedEx because you provide great value to client corporations. As a result the relationships become very close. Clients value AE's as ""Trusted Partners"". This is a great way to sell.
","FedEx has lost a step. Technology is the main area where FedEx is behind. Many times FedEx is not up to speed with customer needs and is unable to keep pace with smaller more current nimble competetitive companies in the marketplace. With margins thin, FedEx seems to need to streamline their operation but is unable to do so without hurting the reliability that they're known for. Instead of being their own worst critic the company has listened to Wall Street type critics who have caused them to move from PSP to shareholder gains as their main purpose.

","They train you one way and when you get on the floor its completely different and they scorn you for it. 

The pay is extremely low and the raises even lower. You start at $9.00/hr and receive a .25 cent raise once a year.

They are constantly changing their mind on how they want you to handle different situations. I would say that even after all this time we have been in this Covid19 mess they are still VERY unresponsive, unprepared and incapable of handling the situation with efficiency, dedication and some level of moral humanity, which brings me to my next point....

They do not care about you, you mental health and stability or family life. Its almost IMPOSSIBLE to get FMLA. If you are forced to take leave before FMLA is approved (say an emergency c-section or complication) you are pointed the entire time you are out and then fired with no regard to FMLA.

Hours are difficult if you have a family. No time off except Thanksgiving and Christmas. You WILL work all other holidays.

","Very heavy lifting. I deliver a lot of furniture, dog food, cat litter, and Walmart/sams club/target products. The latter all pack there boxes way to much often weighing about 80-100lbs. The furniture is often 125-149lbs. Keep in mind you are alone to deliver these items as your contractor isn’t going to pay two people to run one route. And if you have a light day and think you will get home early, think again. You will be asked to go help someone else.

Pros
Global company, management track, good healthcare
Cons
Salary, tenured people, rose colored lens
Advice to Management
FedEx attracts you to the company by showing you all the things they ""could"" offer. It sounds good because they tell you at every turn that it's a ""great company"". The longer you stay around the more you'll notice people celebrating 20+ years with FedEx.

For the role itself, you'll notice how glaring that it is that it is primarily white men. Many people on the team are seasoned professionals who can't wait to tell you about the greatness of the company while conveniently forgetting to tell you how long it takes people to get promoted, how you'll start off with a decent salary even though their salary caps show that they can offer much more, and the software which could be much better. 

Their retirement benefit could use a lot of improvement. They'll match half up to the first 6%. They could definitely match the whole thing if they wanted to. Their bonus structure depends on how well the company does but the company pulled millions last year and they didn't do good enough to award a bonus.

The directors are nice people who are out of touch with the people doing the work at the bottom. Managers are busy trying to push initiatives from the top which could have been thought out much better. There's a TON of red tape. It takes a good amount of time for anything to be approved.

Vacation time is about 2-3 weeks but good luck taking it when you want to. You'll need to find coverage for your time off. That's not to say you don't have team members who'll do it, but looking for one every time you want time off is a haggle.

You work with Sales primarily but Sales is often out of touch with what you do. So be prepared to get work that should have never came to you and could have gone to a more appropriate channel. Also be prepared to walk around what you want to say because there's a way to ""speak to Sales"".

If you're lucky, you'll end up with a good manager who really is rooting for you. But the bottom line is managing your territory ""how you like"" while accounting for the way they want you to do it, how they want you to manage your caseload, enter your time, and do your job.

No room for advancement, as in you're a driver and that is all they will ever let you be.
Absolutely no concern for your safety or well being, You're just a warm body to them.
The contractor system is setup to give Fedex a way to never take responsibility and always put everything on drivers.
No accountability for their own employees, they are not required to take drug tests, don't get reprimanded for throwing packages, etc..
No health insurance, no paid time off or vacation days, 
A driver once stepped off her truck and broke her ankle while at the terminal and did not receive any kind of workmans comp .
We're constantly advised to lie about log in and drive times, which is a DOT violation.
In summary, they don't care about you and this should only be a temporary job so you have a chance at getting an ok paycheck until you find a better job.

Tue May 12 2020, Business Sales Inside Account Executive,"Dallas, TX",Current Employee ,Entry-level Sales,5,"The health benefits are very good.

For low-level business sales, the hourly pay rate (about $23/hour) is actually livable. It's not a comfortable living, but you can pay your bills on the base pay, which is nice.

If you want a career in sales and are willing to move, this is a good starting point. Most inside sales reps can promote to field sales in a different city after 15 months, and the pay starts to get more comfortable at that level.

If you enjoy fast-paced, relentless sales, you'll like the job.

Once global travel resumes, you do get to fly standby at decent prices.

When you clock off for the day, you're done. No overtime, no staying late... just carry the stress home with you and let it bubble overnight.
","Career opportunities outside of sales are nearly nonexistent, despite what management will say in your interview. People can move out of sales if they're creative in finding ways to network, which management in the sales office will not be very helpful with.
The path to move up is through field sales. If you're unable to move, or don't want to stay in sales, the best of luck to you.

While the hourly pay is livable, you're unlikely to receive the bonus checks you hear about in the offer letter. 80% of the Dallas office does not bonus for the quarter. It's not a question of work ethic. FedEx is struggling as a company, and it's a very difficult market to be competitive in. Whether or not your territory has potential is luck of the draw.

Since FedEx is doing so poorly right now globally, upper management has put all of its efforts into straining the sales team to do more, constantly. The difficulty of this is exacerbated by the antiquated internal systems that take minutes to hours to struggle through for things like pricing proposals.

The number of sales calls you're expected to make continues to grow to ever more unrealistic levels. While it's possible to make all the calls, emails, and sales opportunities that are expected of you each day, it's unsustainable. I've cycled through my list of customers, some more than once over, in the last month because I'm constantly trying to reach the daily call metric.

If dialing the phone were your only responsibility, it might make sense, but you're also expected to draft pricing proposals and present them to close business. If you spend an hour researching and drafting pricing, and then you spend another hour presenting it, this counts as one sales call in your daily metrics.
According to management, at this point, you've had an extremely unproductive day with your one measly call. Whether or not your time is spent growing revenue is irrelevant.

With such an emphasis on arbitrary daily metrics, there isn't much opportunity to actually do the job you're hired to do, which would be closing business.
All this said, I haven't mentioned how much time it can take to help resolve customer issues. You're constantly told by management to let customer service handle complaints and issues- your job is to sell. Fair enough, but customer service seems to be trained to send customers to their account executive when they aren't sure how to handle something. 

This means that any time you spend not working toward your daily metrics counts as not working. If you're fixing something for a customer, working to create revenue for a company by making proposals, or doing something as important as assisting a teammate with a problem, you are wasting your time in the eyes of management.

There's not enough time in a work day, and there's not enough resources to do the job. All of the complaints I've listed have been discussed with varying levels of management, and are consistently discarded as a personal problem with time management.

TLDR: you're expected to constantly do more, your efforts are hardly appreciated, and when you try to make suggestions for improvement, you're ignored. You feel undervalued as a FedEx employee during these times. The company is struggling, and is trying to get every bit of mileage out of you it can.

I would only recommend this job to someone who lives and breathes selling. Otherwise, this job is not worth the stress.
Advice to Management
Have faith in your employees. Listen to some of the complaints and take them to heart. Less micromanagement and arbitrary metrics will lead to happier, more productive employees.

Oh, and free pro tip: The employees recording 30+ sales calls per day while finishing all their administrative tasks are lying.

","Where to start. Severely delayed COVID-19 response. No hazard pay incentive - literally a t-shirt and a pin is what we’ve received. Inconsistent schedule - some days are 12 hours, some days you have literally nothing to do and are told to not come in. Poor communication from management. Inability to progress into management unless you are willing to relocate, and training is unpaid. Availability of trucks is a constant issue. Express packages now being handled by Ground for last mile optimization (less packages = less work). Inconsistent raises - supposed to be a step progression but nah, you’ll get 2% instead because corporate decided to dump tons of money into GPS and turn-by-turn directions on android tablets that don't work right (or at all) because they’re running off of maps from 2013. New employees given better vacation benefits and faster advancement, older employees don’t get any more vacation. Insurance is somewhat decent. Flight benefits aren’t worth it - you are literally last on the standby priority order. No a/c in some trucks during summer months and mechanics won’t fix it - same with heat in the winter.

Forget it they will hound u to a point that the lack of financial improvement is no longer tolerable. Also, sent my director an email how I made another operating company at the company another 100k that I don’t get credit for and he ignored me. As a woman u r treated less than because u r not part of the boys club. Now this is just my region. Everywhere else I feel woman r respected.

Advice to Management
Overall, I have loved working for this company. However, I no longer feel that upper management is acting in the best interests of the employees. Integrity. This seems to be a forgotten word at FedEx Logistics. First issue - requiring hundreds of employees to move to the new HQ in Memphis if they want to keep their jobs. Second issue - you retract the initial agreement on the final date of employment for some of these employees and move it up by 6 months. Even those not directly impacted are appalled. How is this an example of the Purple Promise and PSP? You want employees to use these principles at work, but somehow that does not apply to upper management, Listen to your employees - the Listen-Learn-Act survey is not a very clear gauge of how employees really feel. The questions are not clear and there is no room to add text responses. I think that if you really took time to listen, you would not hear many favorable responses to recent changes that have been taking place.

I would have loved to hear the flip-side here. If the supporting roles were told a similar story so that the mindset was ""let these people sell!"". When customers utilized customer service- they rarely got the issues resolved and then AE's are putting out fires.
