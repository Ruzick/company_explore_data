Sun Jan 31 2021, Solution Architect,"Maplewood, MN",Current Employee ,Solution Architect,1,"One of a handful of vertically integrated manufacturing companies left in US. Loyal to MN, has it roots here and will probably never leave. A significant portion of 3Mers are lifers (15+ years or more) switching roles every couple years internally. If you're a mildly risk averse millennial who values stability and the chance for lifelong employment like the days of old, there is no better place. Incentive structure is very generous in this regard, promotes employment longevity and cross-training.
","Insular isolationist culture, does not look outwards enough for new ideas, technologies, processes. ""We are 3M and do things different"" prevents a lot of technology adoption that would be considered common place. This goes hand in hand with a tendency to recreate applications/solutions using local IT resources.

Fri Jan 22 2021, Senior Automation Engineer,"Silver Spring, MD",Current Employee ,"Brilliant People, Antiquated Corporate Policies",1,"- Some of the most amazing and intelligent Engineers I've ever had the pleasure of working with have been on my team and sister teams
- HIS Division functions a bit like a start-up : laid back, able to control your own sprint items/research items, lots of freedom with AWS/tech stacks (although that can be from team to team)
- Decent Healthcare
- Time off is lackluster unless you get a boost because of where you live, then it's awesome
- Sick time is pretty stellar
- 401K Match is decent + StockOptions are a nice perk
- Most of the functional teams who lack the software/cloud knowledge are really trying to come up to speed; there are lot of good people working really hard to grow/be better in the software cloud space. (But, lots of managers who aren't want to put down others and get defensive).
","- Still a pretty heavy white Boys club, especially in upper management. There are some female/non-white/non-binary faces, but not enough throughout the org, ESPECIALLY in engineering
- The Job function structure is opaque, I've interviewed people who were to be in a grade above me with less experience in my skill set
- A lot of the brilliant engineers I've worked with are actually Contractors/employees of Stelligent, so they don't stick around
- 3M HIS seems to have trouble hiring/finding talent for some reason--HR I think doesn't know how to recruit Software Engineering folks, so a lot of Managers and team leads are doing double duty finding people. Hiring process is SUppppppper slow/drawn out/unorganized so we lose candidates before we can even interview them
- Definite disconnect between the actual engineers and management who controls our destiny (I get the sense that no one read my resume/I've gotten silo-ed/forgotten)
- Corporate policies are still not quite there with functioning like a software company
- There's no on-call : the reason this is a negative is because they haven't designed it yet. The teams are really advanced/accelerated in some aspects and in the dark ages in others. (Advance CICD/IaC, yet no ops support, and the cloud security team is completely lost).I can see this coming back to bite 3M when the SLAs/apps get more attention by users. Some managers are trying to fix this. . . 
- whenever corporate networking has to get involved, it's a power struggle. They don't understand cloud and generally behave like the 1990s with IP space requests; there's a definite sense of some teams feeling threatened outside our little engineering/devops bubble
- education reimbursement is pint-sized compared to company size
Advice to Management
- Take care of the talent you already have, ensure they are happy/well cared for
- Get a better recruitment team
- Corporate is getting there with adopting cloud/software company mindset, but it's slow going, need more of a company educational adoption some employees can get there too!
- pay scale needs an adjustment
- make the position/pay grade structure less opaque to ensure fairness/mobility
- Promotion structure is also somewhat vague/opaque and needs clarity

Mon Jan 04 2021, Design Engineer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Good Company,0,"3M has a great company culture. Everyone seems to uphold the companies values and in my two years working there I have not met anyone I wouldn't want to work with again. It is a large company so there is some ""Bureaucracy"" but I have never found it to hinder my job. The thing I like most about 3M is their flexibility in working and their willingness to do what is best for the employees and company rather than just the shareholders like many other companies in todays world. They are very ""conservative"" in their approach so don't expect crazy high salaries and crazy new world perks(like unlimited PTO, drinking at work, constant parties) but I have found everything about my job and its benefits to be fair or better than average. The most surprising thing to me about 3M is how many employees have been there 20, 25, 30+ years and still love their job, I think that is a testament to how well 3M treats their people.
","I really cant think of very many cons. As mentioned before it is a large company so somethings are slower to move and you are usually defined by your role so if you want to do a lot of random unrelated things it might be tough too. Vacation is probably very industry appropriate but can feel like less compared to some other companies.

You need a total overhaul. Your company culture is toxic and driving talent out the door. Remove the bad players who aren't team players, remove the flag in HR that managers can set to prevent their employees from switching teams, burn it all down.

Mon Nov 02 2020, Inside Sales Representative,"Saint Paul, MN",Former Employee ,No ISR makes “Plan”-Commissions are BS,3,"Decent culture in the company at large. Almost cult like the positivity people exhibit about being there. The company does a good job of making you proud of being a 3mer.
","Before I start, let’s start with a simple presumption, “Sales people want to make money. The harder they work, and more success they have, the more money they should make.” 

This is NOT the premise the entire Inside Sales Dept. follows. If you are looking for the premise above, look elsewhere.

If you are fine putting in a decent amount of hard work, keep your head down, have no drive to make 6 figures, and instead are cool with a annual 2% raise in your base salary to have a shot in 3 years of a 10-15% raise into a higher level ISR. Sign up for this “sales” job...which really is a glorified order taker or account manager. It is a high base salary 65-75k account manager role. This is not a professional ISR role in whatever dept you end up in. The commission plans are inept.

No one “makes plan” the commission plan changed 6 times in 12 months. Most of the time we were on guarantee as management had no clue what they were doing. 
If you want to receive commission, and excel into higher yearly gross...That is NOT the path 3M takes. The Inside Sales department is valued by the company at large and is receiving lots of investment, BUT it doesn’t translate into common sense. 
No one exceeds plan, no one. That means the plan is BS. It is simply a salaried position and is an embarrassment for a Fortune 100 to state otherwise. 

But that’s what you get when you have a national inside sales director with no sales experience. See, 3M promotes only from within so they have the same silly po-dunk, middle of the road, conservative ideas that the C-level scientist leaders above then think are sensible. Not one ISR makes above 100k with commissions. Several make 90k as a base salary, but that’s it...there’s no commission happening, maybe 5k annually...is that a sales role? You tell me.

Lastly- if you’re a woman or a minority-beware of the grade level they hire you in at...no matter how qualified you are for other roles in the company they have a strict HR rule that limits upward promotion. 

Dumbest thing I saw was a co-worker, who had more qualifications than most of the competition, was not allowed to sit for interviews with hiring managers that were interested in her, because as a minority she was initially hired in at such an entry level ranking, (way below what she was worth on the open market to save money) and therefore, even though she exceeded the qualifications on the job listing and the managers wanted to interview her, she was denied the change to interview because it beyond 2 steps from her ranking. Total BS for a company that prides itself on diversity. 
She would have had to leave the company and apply for the job (unlikely to get a call because they prioritize promoting from within), or wait 10 yrs before she is able to interview for the dream position that she is qualified for now...talk about a bunch of middle aged HR/c level white guys golfing on the company course thinking up policies. “But don’t worry we’ll send gobs of promotional emails and team newsletters swearing that we prioritize and appreciate our female and minority colleagues...HAHAHA!”
Advice to Management
Look at your high performers...does anyone make commission? Look at your low performers...do they make the same as your high performers while doing wayyy less work? That means your comp structure is broke. “Your annual rating will be different,” is not a good incentive. Salespeople want to make money for what they sell, NOT a silly 2% annual increase.

2. Opportunity for advancement - all my managers supported me enthusiastically and I rose through the ranks. 
3. Try to be ethical and for the most part they succeed.
4. Environmentally conscious.
","1. Slow & more bureaucratic than you could ever imagine. I have worked for a company 2X as big that was twice as fast and had 1/2 less red tape
2. Endless forecasting & report outs with IT systems from the 90's.
3. Most policies are geared toward HQ rather than satellite locations, i.e. plants and distribution centers. They work OK with salaried people in administrative positions but not out in the field.
4. Endless corporate programs developed by bureaucrats for bureaucrats pushed out with no prioritization or ever taking something off the plate.
5. St. Paul mgt. acts line they do not trust anyone not in St. Paul. Endless, incompetent efforts at micromanagement. Many functions under central control.
6. It used to be fun, not anymore.
7. No real growth drivers - if the economy grows 3M does. If it contracts 3M contracts. Poor return on R&D.
8. Current CEO seems lost and out of place.
Advice to Management
1. Learn how to prioritize. Kill legacy, poor performing product lines.

Wed Jul 08 2020, Marketing Manager,"Saint Paul, MN",Current Employee ,Fantastic company for those who mean serious business,8,"What I like the most about working at 3M is all the incredibly smart, hard-working people you get to meet and work with. 
There's not a lot of time or money spent in frivolities here, so if you want silly perks, huge admerch budgets and a lot of fun & games, this is definitely NOT the place for you. 
On the other hand, if you're not intimidated by science, you want to learn a lot, get your hands dirty and handle very complex products often harshly challenged by cheaper, crappier versions of them, this is the place for you.
People in general are very nice and you can make friends here however.
If you're smart and work hard, you will find a lot of opportunities to grow, but they seldom come to knock at your door. You have to network and sell yourself, which is very hard for some of us and very easy for those who often deserve less.
Overall, a great company, more diverse than most because it's Global, but with work to do in the diversity department still.
","2 things:
- I wish 3M tried harder to detect and recognize work truly well done and good employees. In general (there are exceptions), if you're not as talented a self-promoter as you are an employee, don't play the squeaky wheel game wisely or have an Ivy League education, you might be eternally overlooked for promotions or sexier assignments (my boat is more rocked by increasing responsibilities than increasing pay, but that's me), no matter what your successes and accomplishments are. This can be especially true with women and minority employees. In the company there are still big pockets with a total old boys' club mentality
- I wish creativity and thinking outside the box was rewarded and encouraged beyond the R&D functions. Considering our budgets, it is very important to be creative in all functions, especially Marketing. We need more doers and more people willing to think and do things differently.
Advice to Management
- Find and reward good performance properly.
- BEWARE the sociopath of the species: One would be too many, but in reality there are many people in leadership positions who are downright sociopaths. They thrive by ""managing up"" but they are often incompetent at anything else but manipulation, and wreak havoc down below to the point that great employees get their spirit broken and leave the company or end up with PTSD. Believe me, whatever the cost of detecting them and getting rid of them is, it is absolutely worth it, based on the destruction and chaos they cause in entire organizations.

Sat Aug 29 2020, Operator,"Springfield, MO",Former Employee ,Forces political beliefs on workers,0,"A job that pays money
","3M is your typical corporation, and for those who have seen the documentary, “The Corporation,” you'll know what I mean. In addition to that, the Springfield plant is no different than any other workplace, especially large factories - favoritism, discrimination, unfairness, backbiting, the good-ole-boy network, good workers are punished, slackers are rewarded, silly rules, rules that are just made up when convenient, wasted time and money, the blame game, and the common mismanagement pretty much sums it up. Compensation needs to be improved, about $5-$10hr more plus profit sharing, since the workers are dealing with deadly chemicals and therefore endangering themselves, their co-workers, and the community. Mandatory overtime can be a problem and you will be expected to work 19 12-hour days straight to meet “business needs.” But they will give you 2 days off only to repeat the 19 days if necessary, because they care about you and your family, so they say.

With that said, after nearly 4 years of service I was terminated for not conforming to the political beliefs of 3M that were being forced upon the workers. For the last 5 months of my employment I put up with the new policies, the signs, the emails, and verbal communications regarding so-called “COVID-19” and didn't dare question any of it, since questioning the Narrative is strictly forbidden. Despite the absurdities, the lies, the insults, the guilt-tripping, and all of us being treated like children, I remained quiet and said nothing. Even when some mystery dude came around spraying everything and everybody in the break room while we were trying to eat, I just fled the scene and allowed him to continue. As the mask ritual became the latest brainwashing campaign, 3M Springfield brought this charade into the plant and distributed masks for voluntary use, twice, which I simply ignored as did everyone else. At this point I became concerned because I knew the Plan was calling for mandatory participation, so my dignity line was drawn. Being forced to wear some dehumanizing mask that marks my acceptance of an immoral agenda and implies I am contaminated and that my co-workers are contaminated crosses that line, and I refuse to be disrespected and degraded by selfish, unloving people who simultaneously puff themselves up to be virtuous, be it 3M or anywhere else.

After the mandatory mask announcement I requested a personal leave of absence with 3M Springfield HR due to religious objections to wearing a mask for this purpose. After supposedly discussing with “the team” for over a week, the HR manager and whoever is on this team, as expected, did not approve the leave, did not offer an accommodation, and would not let me in the plant without a mask even though I was willing and able to work, so the official termination is blamed on absenteeism.

Most people are aware that this mask agenda has nothing to do with health and safety, no matter how much the order-followers lie and chant their mantra, but rather compliance, conditioning, symbolism, ritual, and superstition. If anyone desires to work with 3M, or any other large corporation, be prepared to be treated like a dumb animal because the mask is only the beginning, so it may be best to just avoid the trap and not even give these seared-conscience people the satisfaction of forcing their inhumane beliefs upon you.

Fri Aug 07 2020, Warehouse Worker,"DeKalb, IL",Current Employee ,A Cesspool of corruption and revolving door,4,"The pay and benefits are greater than other places in the area...not really saying much..
","Forced Overtime is a major problem here, especially during the summer. They do not know how to staff correctly to obtain a good work/life balance. Warehouse workers are forced to endure long hours, short breaks and lunch periods, favoritism, awful treatment from unqualified leads, terrible supervisors, unbelievably complacent HR, an awful and inaccurate productivity system. They don't listen to any ideas or improvements, and constantly blame warehouse workers for their ineptitude in the office and poor warehouse management systems. All decisions are made by those who have never worked in the warehouse, and frankly, do not care about us at all. When the pandemic hit, we were declared essential workers and forced into ridiculous safety protocols, but no haz pay. They don't even care if we die. There is no recognition at all. Those who try to work hard are not rewarded. Most of the people who don't work get better positions and higher pay. It is all about kissing butt. It is a dead end job really. Communication is pretty much non-existent. Upper management all the way down to lead operators all need basic communication classes, psycho therapy, and taught how to treat people in a decent manner. The warehouse management systems they use are slow and buggy. They also use outdated equipment that is used 24 hours a day/7 days a week. All in all... Stay away from here...
Advice to Management
Warehouse workers are human beings and deserve to be treated like it.. If we are in a Pandemic, we are in danger. No Haz pay and no recognition is a slap in the face as well as despicable. Evaluate your management more often, and listen to your employees on the front line.

There are many resources (people and operations) available to provide expertise and support for overcoming hurdles.
","The culture of 3M has become bureaucratic and rigid, with a greater focus on cost reduction. At least this was my experience in the division I worked in. I have heard there are cultural differences across divisions. Micro-management via daily tier board meetings are not conducive to a positive work environment. There are black belts distributed throughout the company serving a 2 year assignment with the expectation of delivering a given cost savings. This generally creates competitive friction across the division.

Thank you for your review. We are very sorry to hear that you feel as though 3M is not military friendly. One resource we have available specifically for 3Mers who are service members or veterans is our Military Support Network (MSN). The MSN provides active support and outreach to veterans, service members and their families, including scholarships, professional development, military speaker series and networking opportunities. If you aren't already involved in the MSN, we would recommend considering joining, as it is a really great resource for 3Mers in the military. We also provide up to four weeks of paid military leave for military training each calendar year to support eligible 3Mers in the U.S. National Guard or Reserve units. We’d recommend sitting down with your HR partner to make sure you are taking advantage of all of the benefits you should have access to and talk through the rest of the concerns you've listed here. Thank you again for your review. We appreciate you sharing this with us and hope this helps","If you want to retain young engineers/professionals, put some more efforts

Advice to Management
As a company that seems to preach diversity to its investors, and fund many diversity related functions, the initiatives within the company to promote diversity where its most needed are lacking at best. 3M often puts a large sum of money into conferences such as SWE, but doesn't always have the funds to send their own employees to these events, leaving a disconnect between what they appear to value and how they demonstrate their values. 

In my area of engineering, around 90% of employees are white men. There is a large initiative to hire more diverse candidates, but the company fails to realize that hiring diverse candidates into a non diverse work culture leads to high turnover. The company needs to roll out mandatory diversity and inclusion discussions and training for all engineering employees if they want to retain any diverse candidates they hire. I have brought this up to HR and I was encouraged to lead this effort on my own, but such a response is putting the burden of change on employees who don't have the bandwidth to lead an additional effort, rather than making a proactive choice and hiring or appointing a team to focus on this issue.

With that being said, 3M does do a good job at promoting job flexibility. I do have the option to work from home on days when roads are bad or other reasons prevent me from easily making it into the office. Management is often approachable and people are generally willing to help when asked.

Sun Jan 26 2020, Supply Chain Analyst,"Saint Paul, MN",Former Employee ,Decent Place to Work for Engineers - Stay Far Away From Supply Chain,2,"-Decent compensation and benefits
-Strong brand on your resume (for now)
-Potential exposure to multiple business models/markets/geographies
-Good place to work if you're in sales or a technical function
","I can only speak for my experience in Supply Chain within certain businesses over several years. 3M only values technical skill sets, and sales to a lesser extent. Supply Chain at 3M is viewed as a transactional, non-professional support function, and is not viewed as part of the business in any division. Supply Chain Analysts in most divisions and plants spend 80% + of their time doing non-value added transactional activities to keep the business running due to 3M's horrifically antiquated IT systems. Seriously, it's like stepping into a time machine back to the 1970s. SAP implementation has gone horribly (to the surprise of no one). The Supply Chain Manager of most businesses reports to the Manufacturing Director; Supply Chain is not it's own vertical like it is at most peer companies that aren't stuck in the 1970s. Most Supply Chain leaders at 3M have no education and minimal experience in the function. Two out of the last three SVPs of Supply Chain had ZERO prior Supply Chain experience. One of them had an MBA from Harvard, so that made him qualified to run the Supply Chain function of a $30B+ organization with zero experience, I guess.

As far as the actual work environment goes, culture can vary by a lot by division but is mostly very old-school and non professional. There is no actual performance review process or development planning. If you work in Supply Chain (and don't have an engineering background) the best you can hope for in terms of career development is jumping from division to division and hope you can get promoted to Supervisor after 15+ years. I can say that in the last division I worked in verbal abuse/beratement by managers and people in other functions was a daily occurrence. Plenty of incompetent people in all functions counting down the days until they can collect their pension (and will not be replaced, 9 times out of 10). 3M is trying hard to make it look like this is a hip place to work. The reality is they have an extremely hard time keeping millennials who will leave for better compensation, time off, advancement potential, etc.

As others have mentioned, you start out with 10 vacation days and this does not increase to 15 until four years of service. They try to make it sound like it's better than it is because they give you 4 floating holidays, except these are Federal holidays that 3M doesn't recognize but you would get off at most other companies anyways.

Mon Dec 23 2019, Research Engineer,"Minneapolis, MN",Current Employee ,"Great job, but benefits feel behind the times.",0,"Everyday is exciting with lots of amazing, cutting-edge technology and freedom to pursue new ideas. The people I work with are also great.
","Overall the benefits don't feel like they compete well with the other companies where I have peers. They feel like they are the bare minimum to get people to come to the company and stay. 

Starting with just 2 weeks of vacation and having to wait 4 years to get more just doesn't feel like enough in today's market where I have friends who start with 4 weeks or more. Most of the 2 weeks is quickly used to visit family over holidays if you don't live within driving distance so you spend the entire year getting burned out, or if you don't save vacation for around the holidays you are one of only a few who have to be working over the holidays, which in the team environment makes it difficult to get anything done. 

The rest of the benefits feel like they are just good enough to make you consider 3M or stay. None lead the industry and it feels like 3M is just barley keeping up with competitors. 

I would love to see 3M make some changes to lead the industry and be more attractive to newer employees. Something like giving employees one more week of vacation or closing sites the week of Christmas feels like a small sacrifice for the extra satisfaction and appeal the company would have for both new and old employees. I think overall it would make for more productive times at work.

Wed Dec 04 2019, Supply Chain Analyst,,Former Employee ,Great Experience and Company,5,"I absolutely loved working for 3M. There is this pride that I would say most employees have working for them because it is such a good company and you get to work on some really cool products that are used every day all over the world. In my personal experience, I always knew my management team had my back and they were excellent coaches and mentors, which can be hard to come by. I was able to work autonomously and create projects I wanted to work on and It was easy to get the resources you needed whether it was in the plant, through sister plants, or though their intracompany website (which is the only company I’ve worked for that I would say had a useful one). In my plant, the systems rarely made intuitive sense, but they worked and we did quite well as far as OTIF and Customer Service levels were concerned, so you could only make things better and more efficient, which is a great position to be in. Lastly, my coworkers were just down to earth. While you always will have the negative folks in any workplace, most people I worked with knew what their goals were and just wanted to achieve them with as little mellow drama as possible and get paid (which 3M also does well).
","3M is a baby boomer dressed in millennial's clothing. On the outside they seem really hip and trendy, but you soon learn the inner workings of the company are still that of a behemoth Fortune 500 company; change is hard to push and there is a lot of red tape to get some things approved.

My main complaint would be the lack of vacation days provided from the start. I've worked for a lot of different multinational corporations; the ones that are competitive for great employees give at least 3 weeks’ vacation to start with. But, I actually had to give up a week of my vacation time when I joined 3M as they would not negotiate this outdated norm that new employees should only have 2 weeks to start with. This was actually one of my main reasons for leaving the company, as I live across the country from where my family is and I did not get to see them as much as I had before because travel times were just too long to get back home within a 2-3 day weekend. I worked for 3M for over 2 years, and I would have had to wait another 2 just to get that 3rd week. I did get a month of sick days, but I was not allowed to use them for medical appointments, which in 2019 I happened to have a lot of. So, I had to use my vacation time for these. The one time I got to go home in 2019 was for my grandmother's funeral, and I had to beg for 2 days of bereavement leave instead of the allowed 1 to compensate for the travel. 

I’m not looking for sympathy, I just find it perplexing that a company that says it is as socially responsible as they say they are has not kept up with the times on this policy. I left for a similar sized, well respected company that gave me 3 weeks right off the bat with an additional week of flex holidays. If it weren’t for this con, I would have loved to stay with 3M.

Sat Nov 23 2019, Analyst,"Albany, NY",Current Employee ,"Good compensation package, low/non-competitive salary, no opportunity for growth",2,"Flexible work arrangements--many people take WFH days or essentially work remotely. Match is 5% on 401k and company gives an additional 3% so it's 8% on 401k. Health is good, get $600 (for individual; family is higher) toward HSA if you take high deductible plan. The work is exceedingly simple and there is minor stress given the lack of challenge. If you work with your ""manager"" (many are really not managers at all...), you can ensure a good work balance and never work more than 40 hours per week. I know people who get their work done in under 40 every single week. If you want to settle for low salary but great benefits and essentially a mindless job that is impossible to get fired from, then sign up. Maternity and paternity leave are good and so many people have a few kids then leave once they don't need/can't use that benefit anymore.
","The pay is non-competitive and everyone is guaranteed a 3 (on a 1 to 5 Likert scale) on their performance reviews (which are a complete joke and if they mean nothing, then management should really just get rid of them). This means you can plan on 2% increases forever...until it's ""your turn"" to get a 4 and then you might get 4%. Promotions are rare and people end up leaving after a few years because if you stay here you lose money and become non-competitive in the work force. The people that stay are the lifers who have never had a job outside of Treo/3M (and frankly don't have the skills to be competitive on the market). Do not take a job with 3M thinking you can quickly move up because it's such a big company with tons of opportunity--I see PhDs who are not moving up and are clearly qualified. How is someone with only a college degree supposed to move up?

","1. Potential for promotion within a group is almost non existence. You have to switch jobs to get a promotion. For example, a Division supply chain analyst for IATD @ level 10 and can be promoted to a level 11 when you switch jobs to a different division. If a different division is willing to give you a job grade promotion why can't your current division do so. There is no consistency within division when it comes to promotion for the same function.
Advice to Management
Look at the the way job promotion occurs at the company. There should be some guidelines and consistency across division to remove the stigma of having to move to a different division to get a job grade promotion. Brain drain can be minimize.

Don't expect the 30, 40 year careers from your employees that you used to see, particularly from the Millennials, if you don't give them a reason to stay.

Mon Sep 09 2019, Manufacturing Engineer,,Current Employee ,Great Place to Expand Your Career,0,"Being in the 3M system, you can take your career anywhere you want to go. There are so many options within the company. Working in Red Wing, MN makes commuting very easy as you do not have to deal with the city traffic. The products manufactured (fall protection equipment) is very meaningful and gives you a great ""why"" to the job. This site is a great representation of Minnesota Nice as everyone is kind and friendly.
","Red Wing is an acquisition site and there are definite growing pains between leadership and legacy employees. This causes some tension on the production floor. The need to ""3M-inize"" is real but not well accepted.

Mon Mar 18 2019, Project Manager,"Maplewood, MN",Current Employee ,19 years strong and going....,20,"There's a reason I've been here 19 years. I can assure you that this company cares about it's employees. And whether or not it's apparent, cares tremendously about the environment, community and products it offers.
The pay is competitive, the flexibility is a tremendous perk and it's fun and exciting. (And ever-changing right now!) 
The different types of jobs you can have are equally as amazing. Administrative assistant, production line assembly, project manager, software tester, project manager, Scrum master, security guard, quality assurance (testing of the products or programs), sales rep....the list goes on and on. If you find you don't like what you do - stick it out for 2 years and transfer to something else. All of my supervisors- with the exception of 1 - have ALWAYS worked with me to get me to my next step at the company. 
This is the place to have inspiration and aspirations - and be safe in knowing your work is appreciated.
They encourage you to volunteer. They encourage you to get up out of your cube to take a walk. They encourage you to seek a mentor to get you through your professional career. Everyone I have encountered is more than happy to sit down with you and discuss your professional life and give you advice.
","I'm a big believer that not all people can work at all companies. To work at 3M, you have to be flexible. Like - really flexible. And you have to work in ambiguous circumstances at times. If you're the type of person who always needs clear direction, probably not the best place for you. 
You have to NOT require constant supervision to get your job done. If you're in a leadership position, you have to have confidence in what you're doing and the ability to speak up and step out in a crowd when you have an opinion, yet know when to sit back and listen (and take some advice too!)
You *will* have difficulties throughout your professional life - no matter what job you are in. From a manager who doesn't manage you the right way, to not being recognized on a project that you worked hard at, to arrogant people, etc. It's YOUR choice how you handle these things. Step up! Speak out! It's welcome at 3M - and with a bit of work (managing up!) - you can train your boss for what you need as well :)
It's a big company - if you like small companies, this is not the place to work. You will more than likely have to walk over 100 feet to get to your desk.
There are some that are still working in the ""old"" way - The ""good ol boys club"" - where you get promoted because you know them personally, etc. My advice - speak up when you feel shunned, do your part, and find another job in 2 years if it's not working out where you are. These are not deal breakers, but I can totally understand and appreciate difficulties through period of time.

Keep listening to us worker bees! Get rid of the remaining ""good ol boys club"" members. Keep standing up for what's right.

Long term career path if you work hard and build a network.
","This is specific to inside sales and the current management in place. Management has never been in sales before. yet are in charge of sales. Lack of understanding about sales process and how a sales cycle even works. It has changed from sales performance to metric based ""calls"" and ""correct contacts"" rather than the customer focused top line. Many employees are calling it their call center job because that's where the current manager came from and runs it like that. Micromanagement and low morale haunts pieces of the personal safety division. If you apply go for some area outside of inside sales and you'll be much happier. If you apply for a job outside of the area they will block you from moving on stating its ""a business necessity"" looking at not a personal career move but you are costing them money because they have to hire someone new.

","-Swing shift is the worst thing about this company. They talk about safety but yet don't seem to care about our health regarding whether we got enough sleep the previous night or day. Having to work 12 hrs after only getting 4 hours of sleep is not fun. You're either a day shift person or a night shift person, there is no in between. Your body will sleep better on one of those shifts.

We could easily go to just 1st, 2nd, or 3rd shift. I understand that the machines have to run 24/7 to make money but this is wear and tear on our body. The people in the office don't understand because they don't have to work it. There are people that have worked here 30+ years and look worn down. I'm not trying to be that person if these hours continue. 

-Also we are encouraged to put in ideas for improvement but do not get compensated for it. The office gets bonuses for implementing these ideas but we just get a ""Good job"". We are a important piece in this process.

Wed Apr 17 2019, Manager,"Saint Paul, MN",Current Employee ,"Pay Well, Old Culture, Poor Leadership",13,"Overall, they do pay well with good benefits. The overall base pay is strong, they match 401(k) at varying percentages based on level, offer an employee stock purchase program with a 15% discount and have the standard yearly pay increases
","The company is clearly focused on and centered around B2B. They do not understand consumer driven businesses and do not adopt their business models and practices accordingly. If you come from a consumer based company, you will be very disappointed. Marketing budgets are consistently the first area to be cut and the company spends at approximately 1/3 of what other traditional CPG companies spend on marketing. They very much adopt the mindset of 'if you build a better mousetrap'. 

The company freely moves people in to roles where they have no experience or expertise. While I can appreciate the willingness to allow people to move freely within the company, they assign people to roles based on tenure, not experience or expertise. People with supply chain backgrounds run marketing, customer service backgrounds run sales departments and operations experts work in finance. Without a doubt, the core of this company is built around technical (R&D) and operations. They do not understand nor care about marketing, strategy or sales. While the company claims to be focused on 'growth', all internal indications and behaviors clearly demonstrate they are focused on their historical nature of being a 'dividend' company. 

The company as a whole is terrible at prioritizing: every project, tactic and strategy is a priority. If you ask what is priority, the most common response will be 'all of them'. This lack of decisions making is consistent up and down leadership levels throughout the company. Very little, if any, decision making and prioritization is driven down in to the organization and employees are not empowered nor entrusted to make key decisions. 

Because of the historical pension program, the motivation is low among more tenured employees. Many are due to retire in the near future, with those that are near retirement uninterested in new ideas, business strategies or breakthrough innovation. The overall goal is to get to retirement without any significant change. Those with longer tenures do not value outside experience. Their is an unspoken understanding that those with outside experience are known for having 'A3' and 'B3' experience (i.e A.D. and B.C.). 
Only experience gained with 3M tends to be valued by other 3M'ers who have been with the company for most of their careers. The overall culture focuses on 'checking the box' and 'falling in line with your boss'. While titles appear to show a flat organization, make no mistake, decision making is very much hierarchical. The company needs a complete cultural reset to have a strong chance of succeeding in the future.

Benefits should be competitive across the board to obtain and retain top level talent. There should also be a more concentrated effort to change the ""stuffy"" culture.

","Avoid this place! 3M is a good company but management in the DC office doesn't understand what it takes to be a successful Business Development manager. They constantly micromanage you. You'll spend 75% of your day sitting in meetings, half of which are irrelevant to your BD portfolio. Every piece of work that you turn in will be scrutinized to the tenth degree. There is very little budget to go to conferences or meetings. If you are ""allowed"" to go, you've gotta provide a detailed explanation on why you need to go, an agenda, who you plan on talking with, a back brief etc. Management thinks that conferences, etc are a waste of time and money. They don't like you talking to other departments or senior Execs in the company without getting ""approval"" first. If you take a vacation, they'll make you feel guilty about it. Avoid this place at all cost. It sounds appealing and attractive but once you get there, you'll quickly realize it wasn't what you thought it would be.

The Benefits, especially Medical, have been awesome.
","I worked in a warehouse, in the beginning we were encouraged to want to advance. But as management changed, they made lead positions fixed and unless they left that position, there was never a chance to do more. They also didn't want ideas from the workers that did the same job everyday, they preferred to hire new engineers to do that. It was emphasized that a warehouse worker's thoughts were useless.
The biggest Con, beware of being put on LTD. The facility i worked at, I could have worked in the office instead of permanent disability, but management for that facility preferred a separation of Office & Warehouse. While it's great still getting medical benefits, the 60% pay of when you were put on LTD is rough. And there is no adjustment or pay increase if you are out for years. You will be quickly forgotten. As the Doctors have told me, it's the way of big business; they'd rather stick you in the system and forget than help you be beneficial to them. 
I truly love the company, the products are the absolute Best, but being forgotten on LTD is a road that leads to depression and self doubt.

Hold your managers up to a higher bar. Your lead operators should not be gossiping about what is going on with employees about situations they are not privy to regarding other co-workers.

Benefits etc are at least as good (sometimes better) as other local opportunities.
3M club offers solid extracurricular activities, either company-sponsored or at an attractive discount
Excellent coworkers. They screen out the jerks and mentally deficient.
Paid time off policy is in line with what you'd get anywhere else, but they require only 24 hours notice if you want a day off. All your vacation is allowed up front.
","Usual ups and downs for factories. Right now we're in a slow period so no overtime or new hires. Temps are treated as temps.
Pay scales make no sense and are not based on department rather than technical skill. Depending on what department you're assigned to at the beginning your starting pay could be mediocre (for mentally demanding work) or excellent (for easy work).
Attendance policy is ultra-aggressive. If you're late, even 1 minute, 3 times in your first 6 months you're fired. With this company it's essential to have amazing transportation.
No sick pay - you call in, you get a point. No ifs, ands, or buts.
If you quit or get fired at some point during the year you have to pay back any vacation you've used but haven't ""earned"".
Advice to Management
Take a closer look at pay scales across departments. If an advanced operator with excellent technical skills and 5+ years ijn their department is making the exact same wage as someone that literally just started (with no previous experience) in a different department, there's something wrong - especially when the latter operator is going to be making more than the advanced operator in 6 months.

Wed Aug 22 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Great Company, But IT needs to change",5,"3M management is trying hard to reinvent and innovate.
Management and HR are trying hard to retain IT talent and going through business transformation with new SAP implementation.
People at 3M are nice and professional. 
It provides work and life balance.
3M is making a great effort in moving forward with new IT culture.
","Most people work at 3M IT full time do not have latest solid software development skills. That caused a lot of money being wasted.

3M relies on contracting firms ( most Indian firms) to deliver IT results. When things are not done on time, management has no clue as to why, because a lot of low level IT managers do not have any insights to evaluate, estimate and execute the project properly.

Most IT managers do not have latest IT tech skills, instead, they have so called 'leadership skills"". If you are not a professional painter or have been a professional painter, it is harder for you to evaluate a professional painting job. How do you know that you get your money worth for such a job?

Hardcore technical skills are not valued as much as soft 'Leadership"" skill. That resulted in a culture of promoting incompetent IT folks, these people then hire folks just like them, with no real hardcore software skills. It is a bad feedback loop. It wastes 3M's money.

3M has has an archaic HR structure, your manager is your key to success or failure at 3M. That does not fit in today's fast paced, democratic, meritocratic work culture. If your evaluation is deemed not satisfactory, your career at 3M is pretty much dead. That's why if you walk around 3M campus, you do not feel the vibrancy.

3M culture seems to promote niceness, niceness is great, but it does not help company's bottom line.
Advice to Management
Promote IT employees with real hardcore skills to management positions, 

Create a culture which allows IT employee to move without current manager's approval. Because if you do not allow them to move within the company, they will move outside. That's a loss for 3M.

Layoff all the talkers and keep the doers.

I've been here about 10 years and I stay because I feel appreciated. And honestly, there are so many job opportunities within 3M I can try new things or completely new careers while still keeping my professional network and leveraging resources across platforms.

The organization is highly matrixed and there is a lot of collaborative, cross-functional work. The teams are good and everyone pulls their weight

Also, benefits are great. Pay is competitive. Being outside the city, the St. Paul campus is easy to reach, traffic is good and the parking is reasonable at the HCBG site.
","Some things are slow and deliberate. Getting people hired and getting projects funded can take longer than I would like, but they always get there in the end.

Department Heads and Supervisors should be held to a high expectation and should be held accountable for their departments performance. They should be expected to ""Lead by Example"". The moral on a production floor reflects it's leadership above them. To promote caring and obligated production workers you must have caring and obligated supervision. Every once in a while production needs to see that upper management is not getting big bonuses when the working guy is not getting a very good raise. We're all in this together.

","Based off my own personal experience (may not be the same for others), they fully expect you to be available to answer questions/ask for assistance outside your working hours, even if you're paid hourly.

I feel like they should provide much better computer software for every employee. For example, the system they use to enter/submit time is very out of date and not user friendly. The employee website is very disorganized, which makes it hard to find a lot of the information you're looking for. There isn't a specific point of contact for you to go to with any HR type questions, just a general number to call, which doesn't always provide you with reliable/accurate information. And their off-campus/leased buildings aren't the greatest quality for an office space.

","Many employees have a positive view of 3M if they work at the company headquarters. If you work at a manufacturing location you probably have a very different view. Many of the perks available at the headquarters are non existent at a plant location. Cost cutting measures generally impact the plant locations to a greater extent than corporate. 3M is quick to impose headcount and overtime restrictions at plants that cause significant pain for our customers when business is down across the company, even though it is still busy at the plant. The are also quick to require excessive overtime when busy. Plant managers are typically former engineers who have very little people skills and typically practice an authoritarian style of leadership. 3M has a very good overall reputation but there is a large disparity between working at the headquarters and working at a plant. 3M has a history of taking away benefits every year or increasing the cost of your benefits more than what the market is increasing. At manufacturing locations raises are typically very small and don't keep up with inflation. In many communities 3M plants have historically been the desired place to work but that is no longer the case. Opportunities for advancement only occur in manufacturing if you are willing to move every 2 to 3 years.

The project is interesting and the benefits are top notch. 401k is above and beyond. 5% match plus 3%. I contribute 5% and am getting 13% into my IRA. Also I think the vacation is just what it needs to be. It starts a little low but grows over the time you are there. The unlimited vacation that gets tossed around in the tech world now is a big trap. It just allows them to pile more work on you, even though it feels nice to think you have unlimited vacation, you end up getting less than if you had a fixed amount.
","AIP program is a joke. They hold a part of your salary and then in March they tell you that the division only hit 80% of it’s goal and then only give you 80% of what they held. Just call it a bonus guys and don’t try to tell me my salary includes that. Also the production staff is so far removed from sales that it makes it really difficult for us to feel like we have any sort of control over the performance of the division.

Politics and red tape is a little out of hand.

Security seems to exist to slow down development and cause them grief.
Advice to Management
Restructure the AIP. Make incentives that work for the individual or teams. Trying to blanket the whole division with a plan doesn’t have the affect you want and ends up just making everyone feel like the company is robbing from them.

","-Work culture is weird. Unnecessary drama and talking behind backs is common. It's high school for people with PhD's
-No opportunities to go to meetings, interact with managers, or have a lot of interaction with other departments
-Your experience is highly dependent on your boss(es) and building you work in. Many office spaces are depressing and many bosses are not a good fit for their interns. There are dozens of tech aide opportunities at 3M. Ask your future manager questions during your interview and make sure you want to commit to their projects.
-The actual work you do is menial. Tech Aide input on experimental design is limited. You will inevitably run tests, prep samples, and do the dirty work for the majority of your time at 3M. The pain of your workload is 100% dependent on your manager.
-3M hires tech aides because experimental tasks need to be completed. Instead of having Engineers run these tests, this work if off loaded to other employees if an engineer wants to more efficiently spend their time in meetings. Some choose to take this path, while others do their testing themselves. A lab technician would cost 3M too much money, so they choose high school and college students willing to work for poor wages. The pay is not really work the worth you have to do. Take a 3M tech aide job if you are a freshman/sophomore in need of a part time job and initial experience. If you can, work at another company that offers internships with strong pay and work load that will actually show you what being an engineer is all about

The management is more knowledgeable on the “procedures and policy” than they are of the actual job. Writing people up and wasting their employees time for things that could be talked about and moved on from. They sure know how to micromanage people that have been doing the job for years, while talking to them like they’re idiots. Value? They don’t value their employees at all. It doesn’t matter if you consistently meet goals you’re lucky to get an “attaboy.” The management follows rules and enforced rules as it’s convenient to them.

Hello, thank you so much for your feedback. As you probably know, because 3M continues to expand, your plant is going through a lot of changes, with the addition of over 100 people and a facility expansion finishing up soon. We sincerely appreciate the extra time you and your fellow employees are dedicating to 3M as your facility goes through these growing pains. Our goal is that once the new facility opens in June, employees’ hours should stabilize, and you will be able to return to having a more normal work schedule. In the meantime, we would encourage you to talk to your plant HR manager, who would be happy to meet with you to further discuss your concerns one on one. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention, and we hope you are able to return to a more balanced lifestyle soon","Realize your employees have families.

","Seriously over-priced products make it difficult to win against many competitors who love taking business away from 3M; frequently had to do price deviations to gain business; far too many non-revenue producing ""managers"" that looooove to come to this warmer climate during the long Minnesota winters under the premise of ""I want to work with you"" (meaning they will make 2-3 sales calls, then get dropped off at a golf course to meet a friend or relative, and you won't hear from again ... until next year).

For years, 3M billed itself as being ""innovative"", but they really are not innovative anymore and haven't been for many years. They don't really develop new products any more, they just find new ways to spin their old products and sell them into different markets. And they just buy up their competition and take over their management with 3M zombies.

3M also likes to tell new hires that they can expect to be employed with 3M for their entire career ... and then lay people off when the economy starts to go through the down cycle ... only to replace them a few months later with someone 20 years younger with no work ethic, no knowledge of the workplace.

I made over 90k a year in the last three years I worked for them, but you had to be willing to work overtime to make it. I was a union employee. My base pay was 60k my co-worker from the first shift made over 125k in the last three years so you could imagine how much o.t. he worked. we had mandatory o.t. in some parts of the plant, but most of it was volunteer.
","In my 32 years about 7 of it was hell for me and most of us do to very unforgiving management. But after the plant did a plant wide survey, union and non union, 240 surveys were handed in and ""ALL"" surveys were VERY negative, 3M st Paul was shocked by the survey and the work got back to us that it was the worst survey they ever received. But! I give them credit 3M(st paul) within one year all five plant leadership team were gone, two fired three other moved to other plants. I also give credit to the worker's both union and nonunion for standing up to them, that is what got me in trouble,I was always a few years ahead in my opinion of management and they did not like it. So i paid for that when we had the bad managers. When I left 5 months ago the management was ok, no bad eggs. There are not many cons because when you get hired you know what your in for has far as over time and other things that bother some employee's. BUT THE ONE CON I CAN'T LEAVE OUT, IS THERE IS NO PENSION, THEY STOPPED IT TEN YEARS AGO. THEY DO HAVE 401K AND A LITTLE EXTRA MATCH ON SAVINGS FOR new hires. So if you could find a job with a pension and a 401k and same pay,go for it. 3M doesn't make any promises when it comes to money.

","Very very poor middle management; performance reviews are a joke (sadly) and there is a forced distribution such that everyone essentially gets a 3 (on a scale from 1 to 5); nearly impossible to get rid of people who are worthless (they end up quitting or stay forever).
Advice to Management
Titles mean very little; degrees mean essentially nothing; cut the fat and promote career development by having performance plans that mean something (right now they are arbitrary in a forced distribution and everyone gets a 2% increase, nothing is merit based). There are also many positions that just dead end and have no further career path. Middle managers (e.g., anyone with ``supervisor'', ``manager'', or ``director'' in his/her title) should be evaluated for ability; many are incompetent and this is completely inconsistent with those that they manage and that manage them; this layer of the company needs to be seriously reviewed. The sales team is positively miserable and some people that are in sales (e.g., Engagement Leads), are not even commission based but pull well into 6-figures with no ding to salary when they consistently fail to meet expectations. The sales unit is truly bringing down the entire division.

Middle managers (e.g., anyone with ``supervisor'', ``manager'', or ``director'' in his/her title) should be evaluated for ability; many are incompetent and this is completely inconsistent with those that they manage and that manage them; this layer of the company needs to be seriously reviewed. The sales team is positively miserable and some people that are in sales (e.g., Engagement Leads), are not even commission based but pull well into 6-figures with no ding to salary when they consistently fail to meet expectations. The sales unit is truly bringing down the entire division.

Hold people accountable for their actions, or lack of action. 

Improve the processes to eliminate down time. My jaw hit the floor when I first saw your asset downtimes. The same repetitive problems that never get resolved, have the engineering team follow through to eliminate theses nuisance issues.

Stop undervaluing your contract workers. These employees are doing the same job as the 3M'ers at a lower salary and no benefits. Your decision not to renew contracts is causing you to lose talented employees. 3M needs to show loyality to their country and not eliminate American jobs by outsourcing them to Costa Rico. Shame on you! 3M also needs to stop overworking their employees and recognize when they have unreasonable expectations, workloads are not attainable and recognizing when more employees are necessary. Stop waisting money with the contract worker revolving door. Your practices are putting a strain on 3M'ers to continually train new employees over and over again and keep them from completing their jobs.

","Management is ""Superior"" to all, as in they are holier than art thou. Hated working under the plant manager who was present during my employment in 2012-2015 and HR went to crap. They will walk you out of the plant/fire you over the dumbest things (even for so much as uttering a curse word), they've taken away profit sharing, forced 401K of 6% or you can't have it, and it felt like they quit fighting for decent priced insurance. Also, no pension. You put into your 401K or nothing when you retire. 3M has scaled way back on bonuses offered to employees and hires/shuffles around horrible management. You can almost guarantee whoever your supervisor is has no clue what the actual job is of those they are supervising, as in they've never done the job so you could lie and say something takes you twice the time to screw around or you could say it takes half the time and do a really crappy job. If you don't do your work, management will more than likely just force one of your co-workers to do it (one of the grunt workers) because none of them have a spine to speak to those who defy them. You must also have a certain last name to gain any recognition to move up. If your nose isn't brown, you can stay the low man on the totem pole. Also HR isn't there for employees; they're there for ""the company"" so they do no wrong because it's the ""employees"".
Advice to Management
Hire better management including more effective HR, enforce fair practices, stop showing favoritism, and make group leaders more accountable. Also, give the employees back their pensions, stop the forced 6% of the 401K (let them put it 3% if they want), and for God's sake, let them smoke.
