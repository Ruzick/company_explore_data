","They laid off the vast majority of employees in their IT department who dedicated decades of their lives working for the company. The employees were replaced with a bottom of the barrel, offshore, consulting company. Before employees received severance packages they were required to train their replacements. It became a miserable environment to work in, with constant turnover. The consultants don’t have the knowledge needed to do their jobs. As a result the consultants look to blame others and seek excuses to get out of work. It’s terrible to see the quality of this company crumble, and disappointing they cast American jobs aside to cut costs. I can’t recommend avoiding it enough.

Only way one will succeed here is if you can sell the poo out of life insurance or you have a market that really wants/needs life insurance...even then there are much cheaper companies out there
","Definition of ""throw you into the fire and see if you survive"", very little to no actual help (claim to have an amazing training program but not true), they teach you how to sell their products and how they can be a solution to every single problem out there. Really just not a good business model. It's a glorified pyramid scheme. Bring in as many people as they possibly can, have them sell to all their friends and family, then once they burn through that market if they're not able survive on their own then they have to leave and they'll bring in the next wave of college graduates and the whole process just keeps starting over again.

Benefits are absolute poo, only good thing is they offer a Roth 401k. Zero match on it tho and health insurance is insanely expensive. 

The whole culture is all about selling and how to make the most money possible as opposed to what is necessarily the best thing for the client. Life insurance can only solve so many problems and isn't a solution for every person/situation out there. 

If you're goal is to be a Financial Advisor one day, there are much better routes to go and I would not recommend this job AT ALL. They also do not allow you to do AUM unless you've worked there for over 3 years and have sold ""x"" amount of life insurance

They have the most successful agents and advisors in the industry based on Million Dollar Roundtable Qualifiers. They might not have the upfront compensation, but their residuals and retirement plan set your future up to be great. When analyzing compensation at any company, you should look at the short term, mid term, and long term. New York Life is good to great in all 3. The opportunity to move up and laterally is what really attracted me along with having control of my career as it's based on performance. So if you hit the metrics that's set for a position, you can move into that position without any barriers to entry from management because you qualified based on metrics. Lastly, the company does what's right for the clients as long as the agent/advisor helps the client out because the client doesn't know what to do within the NYL system.
","It's not for everybody. You have to be self motivated and passionate about success. It's easy to say you want success, but it's harder to put that into action. It's heavy commission based with monthly bonuses, so if you don't have the drive for success you'll be better off making minimum wage. If you do have the drive, then it's a 6 figure income and more.

The way New York Life structures their agents as employees works great for the company. If you have a vast natural market to begin with, you can succeed. If you come from a previous career with a database of people you can tap into, you can succeed. Otherwise, your chances are extremely low. Nobody is going to build a book of business cold calling. This is B2C, not B2B. Benefits are subpar, no perks. Restructure compensation.

Managers talk badly about team members to others in the dept, there is no trust in a company built on relationships. There is no coaching from managers, we are expected to learn on our own without guidance nor understanding what is expected from us. Marketing leaders lack real leadership skills, lack the ability to prioritize work/projects, everyone is running around trying to put out fires.

I worked at New York Life full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
It is a 175 year old company with many people at various levels who have worked there for many years, decades. Conservative in nature. Risk adverse. Financial strength.

Actuaries seem to do well here, as it is an insurance company.
Cons
Conservative in nature. Risk adverse. Many approvals needed. Top down approach.

If diversity is important to you, look at the diversity of senior leaders or lack thereof to make an informed decision.

Technology has improved but there is still much room for improvement.

I was not an actuary and found getting promoted to be challenging.

We understand that starting out in this career is not always easy. That’s why we offer new agents continuous training and support, to give them the advantages they need to succeed. Training is an important part of how we prepare our agents to meet the challenging demands of a career in insurance and financial services. New agents participate in a rigorous training program, often recognized as one of the best in the industry. Throughout the course of their career, agents receive ongoing education, allowing them to expand their skills and serve our customers to the very best of their ability.

• Our agents are compensated for the work through commissions. Being commission based puts you in control of how much you make, which can be both exciting and challenging. In addition, we offer competitive benefits, as well as a defined benefit pension plan that makes our compensation package one of the best in the industry.

","Just know going in the door that you are being sold a bill of good. They will entice you by showing you these charts displaying your earning potential selling life insurance. 

In the first 3 years, you're given a ""training allowance subsidy"" that's going to subsidize your salary and expenses whilst you build your book of business. Of course, you have to meet a monthly quota to get it...so you could literally go months with expenses and no earnings. Your first ""clients"" will likely be your friends, family, and former colleagues. You'll start by listing out 200 names of people you can potentially talk to about your new career. Note: Be careful about entering your folks' information into Salesforce because once you leave, they own the data and will contact them long after you've left the company.

I had to pay for EVERYTHING including software, office supplies and staff that I didn't use. The chargebacks are onerous as well. For example, if a policy lapses or cancels anytime in the first 12 months, you must pay the commission back to the company (even though they've collected premiums, your commissions are not prorated).

6. District agent contract is with New York Life is hands down the best employment contract in the entire industry
","1. You HAVE TO PRODUCE! The compensation is commission dependent with no base salary. There is a production based bonus of up to 80% of commission plus addition to other production bonuses for the first 36 months with the company to supplement new agents while they build a book of business. That said, if you expect to get paid for showing up then perhaps this isn't the career for you. Building your financial services practice is no different than starting a business from the ground up! You need to be completely self motivated and have an alternate income (such as spouse income, investments, or pension from previous career) or 6 - 12 months of savings while you are building your practice. If you come into this expecting to be profitable from day one then you probably need to find a different career.
2. You must have a thick skin! If you can't deal with hearing the word ""no"" then this is probably not the career for you. You are going to hear it all the time. This is a sales position and ""no"" is simply part of the customer/client psychology.
3. You can't be a know it all. I've seen too many people fail in this career because they walked in thinking they had a better way and didn't follow through on what they were trained to do. You can't do that. I hate to say it but if you're going to be successful in a career with New York Life, you have to drink the Kool-aid. There's a reason this company has the top advisors and agents in the industry and completely dominates membership at MDRT. Its because the systems work...as long as you do!

The management team works together to help every agent grow both professionally and personally. 
2. Teamwork: You can be put on a team or work individually. There are senior agents and advisors that will mentor you along with a management team and product consultants. 
3. Options: Within two years of working with the company you have the opportunity to learn the management side, become a full financial advisor, learn about positions in the home office, or continue to enjoy the agent role. 
4. Training: The training for out industry is absolutely outstanding. I have worked at other financial firms and have many family members in the business and what New York Life has is truly special. 
5. Uncapped Income: You truly have the opportunity to earn as much income as you work for. My first year did not make six figures, but my second year I did and I make about 145% every single year compared to the last. There are many people in our company (and office) making a seven figure income.

New York Life offers many third party programs to help their employees learn this and become who they want to become (both professionally and personally). 
7. Pension: How many companies still have a pension!? Not many, New York Life does. 
8. You can choose your work hours and vacation time
9. The management team works with you when you have personal situations and does not let you go during times of uncertainty. In fact, they give you more attention and help. Trust me, I've been there.
","1. Starting Off: Like any business when you first start, it takes hard work and determination to succeed. To build a strong base of income, you will need to work diligently and have a positive mindset. Use the resources the company gives you to make it easier. You do not need to go to school for 8 years to work at this company, but you do need to be patient and trust the process. 
2. Small 401K match based on profit sharing (but pension makes up for it by far!)

In the end, you're in the business of selling insurance: an Insurance Salesman. You're expected to go out and prospect anyone and everyone around you, including your family, friends, neighbors, ex-coworkers, ex-anything. 

First we were asked to draft a list of all the potential prospects of people in our lives, no matter how distance the relation. Then we're told to call them and just act naturally while using some script to sell them on our insurance plans. We're constantly hammered with the idea that we're doing something truly selfless and magnanimous, simply helping people to protect their loved ones, and perhaps the ones who believe that the most are those who succeed. For me, this whole business model is based on some Wall Street narrative meant to entice prospects who are just being extracted for their relationships.

","When I returned from maternity leave, I was not provided a safe space to express my breast milk. I requested for a lock to be installed on my door to ensure that I will not have any intruders. That was quickly declined, and the response I got was because of budgeting reasons. I was made to feel discouraged like this is the way things are. I was told others before me have tried going to HR, but that did not help them. I knew what my rights were as a working mother, but I decided to just leave the company instead of fighting with people I will have to work with on a daily basis. Even if I won the battle of getting a secure place to pump, I would be in a losing position as I'm surrounded by people who have shown that they do not respect mine and my child's needs.

Management style is more on the micromanaging side. Managers cared most about making themselves look good in front of their leaders, and not so much about the mental and physical wellbeing of their team members. At least, this is the case in the area I worked in.
Advice to Management
HR needs to make sure each office has a designated pumping area where mothers feel comfortable using. Also, training managers on how to have an open line of communication about these topics. That way, mothers returning to work don't feel like they are a burden on the company and instead feel welcomed to come back to work.

Supposedly best training in business for newcomers in the industry.
Making council agent status is the key to opening doors for growth, and NYL has great council agent fully paid parties and conferences. 
In the years I have been there I saw folks move into several different positions from an agent position. So really opportunities are there but only if you reach Council Agent status. Which is REALLY hard!
","The hours of effort put into a sale are not typically going to be enough to make up for the hours of effort put into all the sales that didnt happen. It is 100%commission, and they TAKE THE COMMISSION BACK if the client changes thier mind or misses a payment. That leads to unstable income and again, the hours of effort in sales and then the effort to make up,for a sale doesnt always equate to income you deserve. Most people fail because of this back and forth of income. PLUS, they have all these charges they take off your ledger like rent, copies, etc. And you never seem to really get the income they say you will. The Partners do thier best but it is a numbers game and at the end if the day it feels like a MLM or network marketing business and not at all genuine. If you arent doing well or the ""top performer"" in the office you are basically exhiled, and ridiculed for not being able to make huge ticket sales or double digit sales per month. When you are in interview stages and considering this as a career, you are courted and told how simple it is and they paint a picture that people want and need what we are selling and will be tripping over themselves to give us referrals and sign up for more insurance or move investment dollars to our #1rated company. But that isnt the case otherwise the retention goals would be MUCH higher and NYL would be able to offer real base salaries. It is quite the good scam for them; we basically work for free singing how great NYL is and trying to recruiting people (because you earn off their commission too as recruiter) but at the end of the day NYL gets a hell of a good labor force without having to pay for advertising or recruiting efforts. 
I worked for NYL for over 3 years before I woke up and realized it would always be a scam for the employees.They flaunt ""high income earners and residual earners"" as speakers to motivate us. But eventually they all devolge that they had to puchase so many policies on themselves at peak times to make some of the goals and recognition points, and after so many years it is like they basically have to earn $xx, in commission to pay for thier own policies...(well that is just money recycled Back into NYL's pocket.) So again, good job NYL, you are clever in your business model. 
All this does make it so they are rated #1in the industry and able to make claims and do right by the client though... So thats good. 
I notice that the partners are pivotal too, not for really helping the agents but for helping themselves, they will find clients and basically run the meeting themselves and then just assign the commission to an agent on thier team. So they manipulate to keep thier # and retention good to promote themselves in the view of other partners and move up to run thier own office. While I was there I saw people get promoted to that had no right recruiting others into this business and being a mentor because without thier contacts list, past connection or timely family member's retirement or passing they NEVER would have been able to close a deal. They were basically shells for other partners to manipulate for own gain. The Back office staff does the best they can, but with such a turn key business and they have to do so much hand holding for the newbies it seems they are underpaid and understaffed. 
Final comment: there was a legacy agent who I worked with and he said to me, in regards to recruiting others into this business "" I wouldnt wish this career onto my worst enemy.""

Develop your people into competent professionals, don't just ask them to sell to people they know. Invest in leads, do targeted campaigns. It's 2019 the Internet exists. You can target prospects, based on income, demographics, geographic area. You are setting up 95% of your new agents for failure, most people don't have extensive warm markets.

A successful career as an agent requires dedication and commitment and, for many, the financial and professional rewards are worth it. We understand that starting out in this career is not always easy. That’s why we offer new agents continuous training and support, to give them the advantages they need to succeed.

Training is an important part of how we prepare our agents to meet the challenging demands of a career in insurance and financial services. New agents participate in a rigorous training program, often recognized as one of the best in the industry. Throughout the course of their career, agents receive ongoing education, allowing them to expand their skills and serve our customers to the very best of their ability","Develop your people into competent professionals, don't just ask them to sell to people they know.

It takes courage to be successful as a business owner and what New York Life offers you as an agent is an opportunity to be in business for yourself under the umbrella of a Fortune 65 company with lots of resources. If you are willing to try, fail and adjust then continue doing what you’ve been coached to do, what the company coaches/teaches you to do works. New York Life is a meritocracy-there are people of all types succeeding because of that.
","Business ownership requires responsibility, and a willingness to do what is required and uncomfortable. The common denominator of successful people is not only are they willing to do what others don’t want to do, they force themselves to do what they don’t want to do. If you are not self disciplined, New York Life is not for you.

","Still very much male dominated in manangement ranks, particularly the more senior ranks. Talented women still have a long way to go to be heard and taken seriously in this company. Managers spend their time protecting themselves in various ways rather than developing talent which is a primary responsibility. Many managers don’t have the necessary skills to develop talent. Management training is weak - no follow up or follow through with managers who are sent to training. They are simply just checking a box in many cases. Senior managers need to do more to break down barriers and get to know people several grades below them and not simply rely on what they are told by their direct reports who are likely trying to protect themselves. Hierarchy is very much alive and well in this company. Collaboration has a long way to go as well.

Advice to Management
First, start by being upfront about what the role of a new agent is. The New Org is a CAT or Client Acquisition Tool. Also, be selective about who you are bringing into the business. Agents without at least 10k in savings are unlikely to succeed. Charging new agents for infrastructure while taking 30 to 60% hair cuts is a bit excessive. Plus, most agents should not be at a cubicle wasting time calling unqualified ""leads"". Instead, they should be out building relationships with referral sources or splitting cases with experienced agents/brokers. They can only pursue this if they are aware of the activity (Your Job is to Educate Them)

 Keep in mind that many might learn the basics from NY Life but will move on after being exposed to the full potential of the insurance industry/space. 

My experience at NY Life was obviously not positive which doesn't define the career opportunity. I just wish my Senior Partner/Recruiter was transparent and honest about what we were trying to do. That is, Sell Life Insurance products like Whole Life, CWL, Guaranteed UL & some Term while also earning the Series/Certs needed to sell VUL, Variable and Also Fixed/Index Annuities. After 3 years, NY Life will take anywhere between 35 & 65% of street level commissions. The justification is for the many hours of coaching, training and Belief System Development. 

I hope this helps.

Sun Dec 09 2018, Associate,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Associate,21,"Pay 170/month up to $10,200 for employees under management level for student loans, 37.5 work weeks, diversity in the office, cheers for charity, company match on 401k up to 4%, free gym, medical center on site and generally kind people. Educational subsidies are available too.
","It’s meant to be a 37.5 hour workweek but you’ll likely work more, maybe 50? You won’t get paid overtime if you’re salaried. There’s a culture of not taking sick days in this office, people come in to work, will vomit and should clearly be at home, then continue on with their day being contagious and spreading infections because they’re so afraid to take sick days. People boast about having worked between 8 to 30 years here without ever having taken a sick day, not something to be proud of, people should use their sick days but NYL has a policy in place that basically penalizes you if you take them. What else? For associates you get ten days of vacation, since you’re discouraged from taking your paltry 7 days of sick days, heaven forbid you ever get really sick or have a health condition, you will likely be screwed. There are no kitchens in the home office north building so no free coffee, there are tiny dirty mini fridges (like the ones you have in college) on floors but they’re never cleaned by the custodial staff so it’s probably rife with bacteria. Not to mention they’re so tiny that you can’t fit anything in, much less for a floor of 200 people? So you’re a fortune 66 company but you cannot afford free coffee, a kitchen, a proper fridge or a microwave? I think personally it’s a ploy to get people to go eat in the canteen downstairs which is supplied by Aramark. When you get hired NYL shamelessly tries to get new hires to buy life insurance or their products, really tacky. Everyone is 40+ and a lot of processes are slow. For example, people don’t know pivot tables, macros, v-lookups, so processes are manual and subject to error. They can’t retain younger talent because they don’t know how to automate or innovate. They still function as older companies do with people wearing suits to work. You have to buy the privilege of wearing jeans to work on Friday. Most companies nowadays are changing their work environment to attract and retain the next generation of talent. NYL utterly fails at this, what will they do when their 30+ year veterans retire? They make work from home a huge deal and cap it at 12 days a year when companies nowadays offer flexible working. Their paltry sick days that you aren’t allowed to use even when you are projectile vomiting is a huge con. The tiny amount of vacation days is a huge con. A fortune 66 company valued at 52 billion that doesn’t offer free coffee, have microwaves or fridges? Come on, don’t tell us you’ll clean the carpets to give your home office a refresh but not give your employees basic access to water and coffee or a microwave to warm up their lunches. There are CVPs that do nothing all day, come in at 930 and leave at 330, citing their suburban homes and lengthy commutes as a valid excuse for their crap attendance but managers and associates who come in at 8am and leave at 8pm, seems to be an uneven distribution of labor and accountability. And yes, dress code is horrible. Old fashioned dinosaur company, nobody makes employees wear clunky suits and charges them to wear jeans in Friday. Seriously? The real innovative companies like the tech industry or even competitive hedge funds let their employees dress comforably. Get with the program NYL, everything is obsolete, no wonder you can’t retain talent under 40 for more than 1 year. If you want to work in a tech role, this is where you come
when you want to start a family and your career goes to die. This place does not innovate and you will not learn anything here. They force you to attend town halls and learning workshops but there’s a ton of bias in the allocation of work. For example, they’ll give an Indian person technical duties even if said person isn’t a tech guru, racial unconscious bias? Yes. This is the type of place you go to when you have kids and want a 37.5 work week and your career goes to die. If you’re older and don’t really care, please come here and wait it out for 20 years before you retire.
Advice to Management
Offer flex time, don’t bully your employees into refusing to take sick leave, offer better work from home, offer more vacation days, don’t offer your employees an expensive crappy insurance plan that costs them 600/month, stop enforcing suits and 1950s dress codes when most of your departments are NOT client facing, get kitchens installed so your employees have a place to store their lunches, heat them up and wash their utensils, provide basic amenities, water and coffee. Get your act in order. Stop investing all your money for facilities in tech. They aren’t the only ones that deserve water, coffee and kitchens. Stop giving people roles because of stereotypical assumptions based on one’s ethnic or racial background. Bias works both ways.

Weeks later, I received a letter (not signed or on company letterhead) advising me my former manager admitted they did send the video and they ""considered the matter closed"". 
They transferred me to a different team in the same department but refused to transfer me to a different department (saying there was no room. Total LIE) had me sitting near that manager so everyday, whenever they walked to or from their desk, they passed right by me. This person has been reported to HR AGAIN for the same behaviour is still employed at NYL in the main office.

Fri Dec 07 2018, Agent/Financial Service Professional,"San Antonio, TX",Current Employee ,I love my job.,0,"I have never worked for a company that from day one made me feel like I belonged. Every face I see in the office is smiling, every voice is friendly and encouraging. I work in the San Antonio office so I can’t speak for other places, but I love everyone here. The motivation, constant encouragement and training I receive everyday in the office keeps me inspired. The fact that I get to be my own boss and rely completely on my performance instead of others for my pay is amazing. If you are someone passionate about helping others and good at self management this job is the greatest. I’ve read some of these other reviews and it saddens me to read about other people’s failed experiences. I have to believe that there are many others out there like myself who are just incredibly thankful and feel blessed to have been given such an opportunity. I haven’t been working for the company long, but in my first month as a contracted agent I made more in one paycheck than I ever made in a month at any other job I’ve ever had. I feel I quickly established a working routine and so far have had consistent success for several months. Getting paid weekly is another great thing. If you make it a goal to go out in the world and meet new people every week you will succeed. You are your own boss! You make the hours! You determine your income!
","You need to have a nest egg coming in! The amount of time it takes to get contracted can be long. You do not get paid until you contract. That means 1. Getting your licenses from the state which can take several weeks. 2. Passing a pretty difficult exam. 3. Completing all training courses. 4. Having enough clients with a monthly commitment to meet the minimum up front commissions. 

It’s hard if you have nothing or do not have a significant other who can help.

You do not get paid on the work you put in, you get paid on the results you bring in! Not a con for everyone, but for some it’s tough.

","100% commission, must produce consistently by 6 months (they don't tell you this); required classes/meetings 20+ hours per week, including weekends; management concern is more with development of new agents - while management does not actively sell insurance (in some companies managers have their own book of business), they are recruiters and paid on their level and retention of recruits. As a result, many managers are more concerned with their recruits getting a ""big"" case right when they start, then training and development drops off for that agent and is re-focused on a newer agent until they submit a ""big"" case, and so on. Primary initial focus is entirely on getting as much money from family, friends, past co-workers, etc. ; Company charges about $200/month in fees for printer, internet, paper, materials, etc.; once registered (you must pay for all testing if do not pass, this is close to $500), your Errors and Omissions insurance is $1000 annually; the company will talk about how it is easy to make $100K per year in your first year and break it down by appointments set and average commissions, but in reality, usually 1 agent out of 100 in the New Org (agents 5 years or less) will make this amount of money - average is closer to $12,000 first year to a maximum of $50,000 over the next 4 years.

Since the transition to a larger market, Tom has showed extreme leadership, excitement and a sense of understanding for the new culture that he is creating in the Seattle area. Not only are the agents that are working with him excited about the future, but so is the entire team. The Training has stepped up their game from something that was already thorough, but is now showing extreme consistent growth. The honestly understand what it takes to make a successful agent. Yes being an agent takes someone who is driven, motivated and who has a strong work ethic, however the NYL team is amazing at supporting agents with this transformation. Their knowledge, resources, training , and support are unparalleled. Their passion for who they help and why they help is clear. As for their compensation plan, yes it is commission based in addition to a training allowance the provides consistent monthly income. That is the wonderful part about it. I believe it is all about perspective and with this type of income plan, you we get to decide what we earn. How hard we work determines our profit. At any other hourly position, it doesn't matter how hard I work, my income stays the same. Here I get to choose. Overall, I think this company gives people an opportunity to really take care of our families...long term!

The office environment is very professional and people are generally friendly. If you are a team player and have a great attitude than you will have plenty of growth opportunities. Work life balance is great. The company will start you with 2 weeks vacation, and an additional week of summer days (not guaranteed but was approved every year), 7 sick days, 3 personal days. After 5 years you get an extra week vacation. Management is flexible on doctor's appts and other life events as long as communicated properly. I left New York Life because I was looking for a job closer to home with less hours and more flexibility, but other than that I would most likely be the type of person that would retire there. If there is ever a work from home position, I would most likely drop what I am doing and go back to work for NYL.
","Start pay is not great, but yearly increases and bonuses makes a big difference. Performance will take you far if you are able to see the big picture. Hiring new people takes a while probably because the jobs are only posted within the company's career website.

Wed Aug 22 2018, Agent,,Former Employee ,One of the Best Opportunities at One of the Best Insurance Companies,1,"- Straight forward compensation plan which is probably the most fair in the industry. I know of other companies in the industry which use a draw compensation plan which can lead to debts. It's great New York Life makes their compensation plan as simple and transparent as possible. Also, this might not be your experience, but I saw a paycheck for someone who made $250,000 in 2017. This was after many years of hard work, but it shows the potential which is there.
- Extra pay in first three years for just starting out
- Comprehensive, interactive training for three years (New York Life is one of the top rated companies by Training Magazine)
- Partners do not take a cut of commission when they go out with agents
- NY Life offers one of the top life insurance products in the industry and pays billions (with a B) in dividends each year
- NY Life portal is top notch and features a daily beneficiary payout counter, regional resources, sales materials, production dashboard, online training, and more
- NY Life is a very well-respected company in the financial services industry overall. If you're lucky enough to get in, do not let temporary setbacks in the beginning make you leave the company. WORK THROUGH THEM!!
- You will want to buy a separate work computer - but this should be a pro because who doesn't want another computer?
","- Company structure means being assigned to one partner without mobility to other teams. This can lead to feeling like you might not have the best one. TRY TO FIGHT THIS FEELING!! Partners are partners for a reason. Even if they might not do everything the way you might have pictured, they are still management AND WILL STILL HELP. 
- Partners compete with each other for recognition - which means the partner you're assigned might prefer you to not work with certain other people.
- Offices in different regions are connected - which means difficulty getting hired in one region might make it difficult to be hired in another region.
Advice to Management
The fact partners can be so competitive lead to one of the top-ranked partners in my office persuading me to leave my partner and the company and rejoin her team in a month or two. This lead to my career being ruined and my hopes being shattered because the managing partner of the entire region would not allow me to come back - despite 4-5 attempts over the span of a year and even though the partner I left would have taken me back on her team. I guess my advice about this would be for partners and managing partners to be more open to second chances - especially when former agents didn't commit any policy violations.

Fri Aug 31 2018, New York Life Agent,"Philadelphia, PA",Former Employee ,Highly advanced multi-level-marketing pyramid scheme.,35,"You get a discount on your life accident & health course.
","Exactly what the title says, like any MLM scheme, you are sold on the idea of owning and building your own business, this is so they can make you pay for everything under the sun and get away with it, the issue here is that you are paid as a W2 employee and not even as a 1099-so forget the tax write offs you could have had if you were actually running your own business. Anytime a company tells you that you're going to be running your own business but they don't issue you your own tax ID and help you form a business through the state, its likely a MLM scheme. Not to mention, try writing up a real business plan and getting a loan from a bank to fund this ""business"" (you cant) and I don't mean the fake business plan they make you write up, thats not a business plan at all, don't be fooled by that. Now, for a company that makes you pay for everything all the way down to automatic monthly emails to your clients, surely the pay is good right? Wrong, not only are you paid zero if you don't sell anything, you actually cough up 45% of your commission on every sale, thats a lot for a company that is going to charge you for everything including printing out contracts to clients you sold policies to. Where does that 45% go you may ask? Well, like any MLM scheme, to the people above you slamming you every day to harass your friends and family into buying things they don't want or need at the time. Granted, life insurance is something everyone should have, but not everyone believes in that, since many have some form of it through their work, so baselessly calling people over and over trying to convince them further just comes off as harassment. They also try to tell you that you should buy their product so that you ""believe"" in the product more, further slamming home the typical MLM scheme where they say you should own products to actually sell them, ridiculous... Training is ridiculous too, 5 days a week and unpaid, you can easily call in-as they have the option, but no, they make you show up in person which is a waste of gas and wear and tear on your car. Then they have boiler room Mondays where they play a cheesy motivational video that usually is in the wrong context of what the message was about, then make you blow up your friends and family more unless you went on an event and held a fake raffle where you had the opportunity to scam people into giving their name and phone number in the hopes that they could win a prize form you (spoiler, the raffles don't have any winners.) Further, the trainers aren't really bright on a lot of subjects, its all about being as harassing and scammy as you can, when someone asked that they were being too harassing and got blocked from calling, I was hoping to hear a good response on how come off less harassing, instead they were told to call from different phones because ""everyone needs our product."" Yeah, right. They preach this ""everything a numbers game, the more people you call and talk to the more likely you'll make a sale."" So when you get caught calling everyone you can in the phone book because ""its a numbers game,"" you get chastised for not calling your friends and family because they are ""warm"" contacts... No, warm contacts are people interested in life insurance, not because I hung out with them last week.. So yeah, if you come across this company, run. You don't own your own business, you just pay money like you do, you're an employee under a company that has been sued numerous times due to their shady employee pay structure and they don't even care. I would assume the only reason why this company is a private company and not a publicly traded company is so they can hide their shady business practices from the public, not because they care about the customer. Feel free to look into their long history and see the many lawsuits brought against them.
Advice to Management
MLM is garbage, if you're going to steal 45% in commissions, you better at least have some incentives and not charge for everything. Even a first year salary would help lower that 90% fail rate that your company brags so much about. Even without the salary, a higher commission rate would offset the mountain of costs you burden people with, but hey, I get it, all those managers in the pyramid need to get their cut; can't be a proper pyramid scheme without everyones hand in the cookie jar.

","They basically know it’s a revolving door. The company makes money one people coming in, getting their friends and family as clients. The agent leaves because they cannot find success, but the company keeps the few dozen clients they bring in along the way. Then occasionally, an agent will succeed, and they will be the bait for every new hire. It’s a trick, and I can’t believe I fell for it. Everyone tries to swallow the lie that they are “advisors” or “wealth managers,” but in reality they create salesmen, usually poor salesmen.

For reference I actually had great success, made lots of money, but upon some deep analysis realized that the products were BS, the lies I had been fed were prodigious, and I had been lured in by the promise of big money and the opportunity to solve complex problems. In reality, the money was good because I became good at being disingenuous, dishonest, willfully blind to the immorality of the sales tactics taught, and corrupted by the notion of fortune. If you can live with that, then go for it, but get far away from me.

-Management is evidently above company regulations.
Advice to Management
This company is a great start that in the long run has competitive benefits you will not see anywhere else. That being said, they do very little to support you in the beginning, so you will have to band together with your fellow newbies and hope to not get exploited by more experienced agents (which will happen if you're not diligent). My office had several people's careers ruined when I first got there from a couple bad apples, but since they made the company a lot of money they didn't receive so much as a slap on the wrist.

The managing partner was excellent and cares about the well-being of the agents, but was apparently powerless when bringing overwhelming evidence supporting sexual harassment and client sabotage from the junior partner of the office. Nothing has been done to bring this person to justice. This job would truly be incredible if it did not attract and promote megalomania and narcissism. Office culture is generally maximizing revenue instead of treating it as a human-oriented business that helps people first and makes money from doing so.

Mon Jun 18 2018, Financial Advisor,"Denver, CO",Current Employee ,Prepare to have your spirit broken,8,"- pay for licensing (but not past a 63) - training (only for insurance) -generally friendly co-workers
","1. You will pay for everything under the idea that this is your business. However, you have no choice on your numbers or goals (but will be buying printer paper)
2. Mandatory awards breakfasts, punishment/trainings if your numbers are not what management wants to see
3. Flat refusal to transfer you from a partner who lies to you. 
4. Partners who care more about their bonuses than your personal goals/mental health
5. Cult-like atmosphere of NYL being best company ever, and if you fail it's your fault
6. Managing partners who refuse to take ""no"" for an answer - instead you're just not a good team player
7. In order to survive, expect that you will have to make life insurance sales to people who don't need them, or don't need them as large as you do. Also expect to not be the best advisor to your clients because they won't let you learn about the larger investment markets until you've hit something called council twice. Everything is geared towards council - a few days ""vacation"" for you, while you mostly sit in meetings all day.
8. You know that office friend you like? Expect them to be gone in less than a year. Also expect everyone to say that it was somehow their fault. 
9. Maternity leave, sick pay, FMLA is ridiculously hard to apply for or get approved. 
10. Don't expect anyone to actually have the answer you want - either they don't know or don't have the time, so expect to spend a long of time on the phone with the service centers. 
11. Reversals - if your client changes their mind, you will be paying the company back out of your own pocket.
Advice to Management
Treat your people as individuals instead of numbers. Pay attention to everyone, regardless of how much you're making off them. Allow people to learn what they want, when they want to. Be honest with your agents and advisors. Eliminate or lower hiring numbers - it leads to cutting people with good potential and hiring people who wouldn't know ethics if it involved their own mother.

Thank you for taking the time to share you feedback, a successful career as an agent requires dedication and commitment. We understand that starting out in this career is not always easy and our continuous training and support is often recognized as one of the best in the industry. An important part of an agent’s success is the ability to engage consumers, network and develop relationships which is why we offer extensive coaching on prospecting and selling. Our agents are compensated for the work through commissions. Being commission based puts you in control of how much you make, which can be both exciting and challenging. In addition to commissions, we offer competitive benefits as well as a defined benefit pension plan. During the hiring process, we are sure to provide specific detail on how our commission based structure works. We take your concerns seriously and encourage you to email us at helpusimprove@newyorklife.com if you would like to share specific details about your experience","Treat your people as individuals instead of numbers.

Depending on the department you are in, there are friendly coworkers and managers.
","Jesus...more Cons than Pros......So Please think twice 

1) All employees get paid for 37.5 hours not 40 hours. You don’t get paid for lunch 
2)Promotions are very slow in certain departments. You have to switch to get promoted most of the time.
3)Company uses very olddddddd systems that are not even utilized at other companies (literally adds no value to your resume)
4)Management has a tendency to ask employees to “streamline” work but the work never gets streamlined. They add additional unnecessary work which then makes it twice as hard to get the work done
5)Some managers are very incompetent and create toxic work environments 
6)Work can be redundant, overdone, and not valuable for a future job opportunity 
7)I have met lazy people who dump work on others real quickly or find a way to “not work too hard”
8)They ask you to submit goals every year ( annoying)
Please don’t apply or join if you are expecting to learn so much. Company rarely changes processes or systems.

Thu Jan 11 2018, Agent,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Agent,12,"Awesome training and management. Everyone is very nice and management is supportive. Unlimited income potential.
","There is zero base salary. If you are new to sales and do not have an extensive network to sell to, it is very difficult to get off you feet. Everyone is out for themselves and can actually be quite ruthless because of the competitive nature of not having a salary. 
I was told that because I did not succeed in sales that I was not allowed to be transferred or be recommended for a back end position which my education and background is more suited for.
The position lacked a teamwork mentality which was why I applied, and only management cared about you becoming successful partially because your success is their bonus.
 No development or teaching on how to do the most important aspect of sales which is prospecting. They teach you how to regurgitate corporate lingo to persuade prospects but finding the prospects is totally on you. There are many successful people because they learned how to prospect and do it effectively, but as a college graduate with 0 sales experience I did not know how to do that and I was dazzled with the unlimited upside income potential. 

Be careful of the agent position and make sure that you are suitable for it. They will take in and hire almost anyone that fits the criteria. There is a reason that out of 10 people that get hired only 3 or 4 become full time agents.

Fri Oct 06 2017, Sales Agent,"Detroit, MI",Current Employee ,Sales Agent Review,36,"This is a position where you get what you put in - period! This is not a job, but a business. If you see this as a job, then you will not be upset when you have to come out of pocket to pay for things to help you grow your business. I have been with the company now for a year. If you listen to the management team and follow the training program, you can be successful. There is a networking system that you will learn - follow it. The company offers university type training, benefits like group health, dental, vision, and 401K, and management support. In the first year, you get a lot of bonuses to help you build your business. But you must first write a certain amount of business each month to get the extra bonus money. If you do, it helps you survive when money gets low and bills need to be paid. You can get several awards that you must get in your first year. I find that the people who do not hit the ground running, tend to fail. Stay consistent, win awards, and study to find success. This is a great company to build a career but it will not be an easy journey. Find great mentors and stay positive. Do not do this business just to make money because you will fail. I love the industry and I know no matter where I go, putting in the hard work the first 3 to 5 years is crucial. So, because NYL has great products, name recognition, and is a mutual company, I have an advantage.
","New York life can do a better job at being transparent in the interview stage of the process. They show you the perks, but do not share that it can be tough if you don't have a savings or significant other to help you financially when you hit rough patches. They don't share all the fees they charge you to work for them life desk, portal, ect.They don't tell you that you lose some important bonuses your second year. They don't tell you your contractual requirements during the interview, only after. They don't talk about reversals and how that can hurt your business. They don't tell quick they will let you go at the end of the year if you did not meet your contractual requirements. Also, depending on the office you work out of, there can be too many meetings that take you away from sales, which is never good.
Advice to Management
Be transparent during interview. Tell the good, the bad, and the ugly of the position. Share the cost you charge us to use your office space, and don't tell people how much they can make in their first year if you know the data doesn't show that too me true. STOP LYING TO PEOPLE!

","The office has too many agents that are all hitting up the same market. There are around 100 agents fighting for the same market not including all the agents from the competition. The established agents are like a bunch of vultures that pretend to be your friend so you can bring them in on your sales because they ran out of their warm markets and they need your sales to help them keep their contract. Also, they do this because there is no field training so your kind of forced to bring them in on your market and split your commission with them. They pressure you to buy policies on yourself and your immediate family and to hit up your family and friends for policies. They require a list of 200 names of people that you know. Once you burn through your warm market you will not make any money. The leads that they sell agents are terrible and your required to purchase their mailers which are very expensive. If you want to work over 50 hours a week, spend a lot of money and make very little then this is the opportunity for you. Your enticed by a training allowance but the policies you write will probably get declined and you will have to work your way out of a negative ledger balance so you will not get the training allowance so you can go months with out any pay after you trigger your contract because those policies will probably get declined. You should ask for a copy of your contract and read it so you will know how much commissions that you will have to make in a month to keep your contract. I do not recommend this type of career for a person who has a family or someone who wants to make a living unless you want to work over 50 hours a week and go months with out money and have a large network of people who you can hit up for policies and sell other services to.

You would have a lower turn over rate and would not have to keep 100 agents on at all times if you trained the agents in the field and were up front in the beginning that they are all on their own and that your really after just their family and friends. You should introduce a salary plus commission pay scale to keep the better agents from leaving in the long run you would save money on training.
