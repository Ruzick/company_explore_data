Sun Jan 31 2021, Strategic Procurement Manager,"Santa Clara, CA",Former Employee ,HPE does not value the HP Way,0,"Some great individual contributors, who only want the best for the company and fellow employees. Many seasoned people are great in sharing their knowledge, while a lot of early career hires are eager to learn and make a difference. Executives have worked hard to align the company values with the old ""HP Way"" which Bill & Dave, (Hewlett & Packard), began the company with, being the employees are the most valuable asset.
","Middle Management and former Compaq values have destroyed the company. After the HP/Compaq merger, much of the Compaq management were put in charge of manufacturing & supply-chain decisions which put HP back 20 years in the streamlined processes, and ethical dealing, (i.e. supply-chain management accepted items which could be construed as 'gifts' which influenced decisions). When HP employees expressed better ways of doing things, they were threated with the jobs and told by the Compaq management, ""We've Always Done Things, This Way"". HP's open door policy was pushed aside, as the Compaq management talked out of both side of their mouths, saying they want to hear new ideas, and got angry when people did not follow, ""The Chain of Command"". Managers, not individual contributors, are rewarded significantly with bonuses when meeting 'metrics' that are mostly made up numbers, while individual contributors are told they must make those metrics or fear loosing their jobs. Little to no opportunity for advancement, as recruiters are compensated for hiring from outside the company, or if an employee does everything, (ethical or not), to make their management look good to get bonuses.
Advice to Management
Not sure if there is a chance to turn things around, even though a lot of middle management has been removed, but think it is a mistake moving the headquarters to Houston, where the values are not the same as Palo Alto had. Take away the bonus structure for management, and bring back the profit sharing program for all employees that is not tied to each business unit.

Stop failing your workforce. There are way too many bumps on the log that have no real skills outside of HPE, so they panic when they hear WFR. Stop making decisions based solely on employee costs. Instead, consider how you can retool the current workforce. The 10-15% pay reduction turned out to be completely unnecessary given the massive WFR in November and December. Stop partaking in political movements that are garbage and subjecting employees to ""sensitivity training"".

","No consistency in corporate vision or culture. Things that should be fundamental and immutable parts of our core were thrown out and replaced with shocking regularity. No one bothered trying to remember the ""core values"" because they kept changing so often. 
The quality of the people in senior leadership positions varied greatly. Some of the VPs were excellent, inspirational leaders but they were the exception rather than the rule. For some reason, the culture at HPE tends to put clueless, empire building ass-kissers into key senior leadership positions. Failures of leadership are clearly to blame for most of HP's big problems over the years. 
I despised the system of forced ratings distributions for performance evaluations. No more than 10% of the people in a team can receive the top rating and at least 7% MUST get the worst rating, regardless of the circumstances, no exceptions. As a manager, this gave me an incentive to tolerate, even encourage, poor performance in some people just so I could have justification for giving the poor performance ratings at the end of the year. Its a stupid, counter-productive and demoralizing policy.

Advice to Management
Management tends to speak in ""corporate speak"" and it is not authentic. In every employee meeting, every Executive talks about how they are ""so excited"" about whatever they are announcing, even if it bombs later. Antonio Neri is outstanding but the next levels on down are weak. They are currently restructuring, and employees have waited months to find out their new role. They use a Voice of the Workforce survey, then do nothing to address the gaps and concerns. They talk about being the kind of company that everyone wants to work for, but do nothing to invest in systems and processes to minimize the administrative burden on employees. I bet it gets better as the market demands efficiency and effectiveness.

Sun Sep 27 2020, Business Planning Manager,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,If you value yourself there are plenty other better companies out there.,2,"They have good benefits like health insurance, wellness programs and paid maternity leave (but beware, you might get laid off upon return or even while pregnant, I know of one employee that got fired at 7 months of pregnant just for workforce reductions impact.
","HP- HPE has been on a transformation journey for decades, and with that thousands of layoffs have been the constant. During almost 11 years I never felt any type of job security. I absorbed at one point 3 people’s jobs as they let them go and I started because I was ridiculously underpaid. 
There is no control over the amount of work or effort that it takes to do a certain role, so some people might be doing nothing while others are being overworked.

There’s no real career path, although they sell you that the sky is the limit, I was never longer than 2-3 years on a role before a new reorganization or transformation would hit and another arbitrary role would be assigned. 
Applying for jobs to try to move or escalate internally is all a lie. 
Roles are pretty much given by who you know, you will get interviews, because obviously there’s an HR process to follow, but they will ask you whatever just to make the “quota” and tell you that they selected someone else, and that you lacked skills that they did not even bother to ask if you had.
They keep bringing people from Dell, Cisco and other competitors hoping that they will provide competitive insight, and these people will start laying off people to bring in their new buddies and cycle starts.
Being a USA employee is really hard, as their location strategy is to send all to low cost countries. So most jobs in US tend to be moved to Mexico, India or Low Cost countries in Europe.
They also love to let go people with long careers in the Company, I am taking with about 20+ years, by forcing them on early retirement, regardless if they are ready or not. I know a bunch of people that went through it and are now trying to look for a job in their late 50’s early 60’s. A pretty bad way to thank loyal employees who invested their whole lives in the Company. 
They did change their benefits being really altruistic by offering 26 weeks of parental leave. All of this happened while I was already pregnant, so I was pretty exited about that! 
I came from maternity just to realize they had hired a replacement in a low cost country , and they laid me off a month an a half after returning from maternity leave.
I would not recommend this company to work for if you value yourself, and or if you are looking for career growth and stability.
Advice to Management
Value the employees that are about to retire instead of getting rid of them.
Workforce reductions will help you with your balance sheet but is it a sustainable strategy? You have let go so many talent that is being taken by the competition and then wonder why you keep struggling to meet you goals.

","Monumentally behind the times and totally in capable of acting efficiently. 
Nothing gets done without an 8-12 month road map and months of documentation. This could in theory be great and lead to better organization but in reality it means there's constant delays and a lack of competition with more modern nimble competitors. 
There's also an enormous and costly reliance on DXC for any technical task and an extreme lack of even slightly technical people outside of IT/engineering. 
The work life balance is nice in some ways but there are very many employees working at half capacity because they can or because no one is encouraged to automate or be productive. Lots of very manual work done very slowly. 
Data is a complete disaster despite using best of breed solutions and reps struggle to find info as basic as order data or even install base. 
Adding to all this management made it a month into the pandemic before cutting pay across the board and laying off many employees. All the while making more large acquisitions of barely competitive companies. If it took weeks to lead to a covid melt down at an enterprise company where everyone worked remote anyway it can't bode well for the future.

Mostly have to self-train, and some PDFs/videos are not enough for technically complex products. Getting approval to cross-train to improve skills is very difficult. I was not officially trained on most of the products I was expected to support at a 3rd level.

","It's a big company with a massive emphasis on only one thing: shareholder value. This is good from an investors point of view, but bad when it comes to investing in anything that will add true value down the road. 

Every chance they get, they attempt to decrease costs in a way the is not transparent. Health benefits seemed acceptable, until I started using them. The (high) deductible is split into 4 groups, in-network/out of network and medical vs pharmacy, and all that costs me (for myself and my husband) around $500/mo. All other benefits tanked after the acquisition as well, and my old company wasn't a big, they just treated people right. 

Work/life balance is reasonable, but most people that have been there long enough seem to just be getting through it. Not much excitement for innovating or doing anything new. It seems like a great place to be a salesman, not a great place to be an engineer, as all the innovation they make is purchased from other companies. 

There's also a massive hierarchy and tons of red tape for almost everything. My manager has been great at keeping it from being my issue, but I can see the toll it's taken on him and others in management.

","I would not recommend this company because the pay and benefits are lower than average and definitely not competitive, the company does not invest in tools for their engineering groups and the type of work you mostly end up doing is cleaning up other people's messes.

* Company is behind on the technology curve with their products, trying to catch up with distributed system design with microservices
* The recent company change laid off almost all their senior engineers and increased the amount of lower paid, less experienced, offshore engineers from 30% to 60%. Now this new group is expected to transform their monolith products to a microservice architecture???
* Engineering groups are asked to develop leading products with poor tools and limited budgets. This is a company that supports business people, not engineers.
* Engineers spend most of their time fixing someone else's defects and rarely get to work on something new.
* Below average pay for what you are asked to do. Benefits (especially insurance) are more expensive and not competitive.
* The company makes it difficult to move positions within the company for career growth.
Advice to Management
* Invest in good tools for your engineers or what you get is ""garbage in, garbage out"".
* Offer competitive pay and benefits are truly reflective of the market versus lowest common denominator 
* Build a culture of software quality (more CI/CD) so engineers are not frustrated with cleaning up other people's messy code with lots of defects.

Sat Feb 29 2020, Senior Software Engineer,,Former Employee ,It's not HP anymore,1,"In its heyday, up until around 2006, HP was THE place to work. ""The HP Way"" was that management's job was to tell their people what the objective was, then ""let them loose"" to accomplish it. And it worked, exceedingly well. Management was there to provide support and enable their people. ""Micro-management"" didn't exist at HP. People felt proud to contribute, to ""break rules"" if needed, and innovation was a ""given."" Bill & Dave treated everyone as a friend or family. This type of managment was unheard of back when HP was just beginning, and at the time other CEOs literally laughed at their business model. They stopped laughing very quickly, but found it difficult to become ""Another HP;"" It takes very unique skills that the founders were blessed with.
","However, eventually Bill & Dave passed on and we brought in a CEO who outright disliked everything HP was. (One example: HP had ""profit sharing"" and we had a good year and the rewards were quite good. The new CEO was angry at ""having"" to spend those monies on people and rushed to make profit sharing a thing of the past.) And we purchased, in an attempt to ""be bigger"" a company that also didn't fit the HP Way model. From there, the company changed almost overnight. And the change took away what was truly a unique company and replaced it with becoming just another cold, even heartless one. I left HP as a result, as did most of my coworkers. The HP I left had promised me my job back, and I followed up only to find they had a ""policy change,"" and once you left you were not welcomed back. Instead they hired new people, people who know nothing about the old HP, and assumed all companies were the same, job security was always a concern, rewards are rare, and you felt ""disposable."" My heart breaks to see such a miracle disappear.

And my title here, ""It's not HP anymore"" was something a friend who stayed. When she heard I was thinking of coming back she said I shouldn't, and she too wished she had left but was getting closer to retiring. But like most of us ""Old timers,"" seeing what happened to HP is, in a word, painful.

Watch (At least) one documentary, I suggest ""HP Origins."" It does a very good job about how HP started, about Bill & Dave, and primarily, what ""The HP Way"" truly is. It's well-worth the 1/2 hour. Good luck to all.

","Our small but mighty tech company was recently acquired by HPe. My position was eliminated in the process. My end date rolled into the first months of them acquiring us, which was odd and didn't seem necessary. We had to enroll in benefits, payroll, IT systems, only to lose them a month later when we ended. Although they provided some career transitional support, it wasnt at all at the level it should have been. Any questions we had around the process we were pushed into a generic ""ask HR"" email address that would get a response 3 weeks later, or not at all. Their never seemed to be anyone who knew answers or could provide help. We were constantly told to ""go to links"" for info. No personable feel at all. It was a terribly disconnected process and the communication was always broken. The right hand never seemed to be talking to the left. You were made to very much feel like just a number during the process and I could feel the growing curve from a small personable company to a cold tech giant company in which no one seemed to care what you did before the acquisition, or know how to help with anything. The culture started to drastically shift, which was sad. The IT onboarding process on our first day was terrible and I have never been treated so rude by IT people. After leaving, I was told my completion bonus would go in on a certain date, and it didnt. I spent hours back and forth with HR trying to get answers as to why that changed and was not communicated to me. On top of that, noone from HPE confirmed with the state the information I submitted for unemployment benefits, so I was left waiting for a response, and finally the state took it in their own hands to confirm the info with me so I could get my eligibility. I was very unimpressed that such a large company like HPe would not have a handle on taking care of the people affected by an acquisition layoff. Once again...they made you feel irrelevant and like a number. I expected more from a company of this size. It has nothing to do with getting laid off. It happens, its the corporate world we live in,but its about ethics, taking care of the people, and making the offboarding experience as easy as possible for those leaving. Didnt happen. It was a circus over there from the second they acquired us, and it was starting to ruin the great culture our company had into place before HPe came in and swallowed us up. I hope they can improve this experience for future situations like this, because I have such a bad taste in my mouth from HPe, I dont think I would ever work there or recommend them to other peers. Whats sad too, is they bought us because they couldn't beat us. I just hope they can carry the legacy and incredible work we did. There is a reason we were number one in our industry. Time will tell if they will carry our flag or sink our ship..

","HPE throws away their entire Q1 by making huge adjustments during the end of the calendar year, they pay their people under market for the roles they hire for, there's a level of ""playing the game"" internally that hinders the true top performers from progressing, the upper management hides behind the smoke and mirrors of executive privilege while they overwork and underpay all positions, there are fundamental alignment issues in sales teams, understanding what sales reps get paid on is more complex than rocket science, supply chain issues compound the already impossible quota attainment issues, and people threatening to leave are being rewarded with raises and roles in order to stay while more tenured folks on the floor are being paid less than those being hired fresh out of college.

This is all in conjunction with every role internally being converted, essentially turning the entire building into a call center.

","HPE has been through a lot of changes since splitting with HP, but all is intended to strengthen and focus the company. This has the side effect of putting employees into positions that are no longer strategic - but HPE gives those employees a lot of support to find other positions if you choose to stay.

","Upper management has too many initiatives that they roll down to ISAMs. 

Directors make unrealistic promises to upper management which leads to management micromanaging sales reps to the nth degree which stops all productivity.
 
Field reps put in zero effort and are paid two and three times as much as inside reps even though they do not contribute to closed business. It’s demoralizing. 

The pay is below industry standard and is inconsistent across the floor.

Territory planning for FY19 was a mess and many reps are stuck with a quota that is too high for the number of accounts they have.
 
Your success is based on which manager you work for.
Advice to Management
Be more selective with the initiatives you want sales reps to focus on. They can do two jobs poorly or one job excellently. 

Do not promise upper management 150% for the segment when the segment was carelessly rearranged. 

Stop glorifying field reps who do not contribute to closing business. 

Quit micromanaging. You hired these reps. Trust them to do their jobs.

Free coffee, Full time hours.
","Often hostile work environment due to angry supervisors, All shifts were constantly pitted against each other for product output
 and caused resentment and complete division amongst shifts instead of a healthy team environment, Lots of lay offs,
 Floor workers were not respected by Office employees, Does not often hire internally and most supervisors know nothing about 
the manufacturing process and often derailed production due to their own misinformation or unwillingness to listen to more
 seasoned employees, Too many pointless meetings, Majority of contract and direct labourers did not care enough to work a minimal 
amount of work and constantly put down the company instead of trying to change the situation and give constructive criticism
 to management but unfortunately management probably wouldn't listen anyway, Employees would break tools, steal, and damage
 products or HP property just because, Blatant favouritism by management, Threats and warnings to fire employees, 
Unfair treatment by supervisors due to untrue rumours or assumptions, Training was basically non existent.
Advice to Management
Supervisors need to focus more on everyone being a team instead of setting up competition with threats of being fired or moving
 areas because of lesser numbers than other lines or shifts. Supervisors need to be more fair and considerate to all employees
 and keep emotions in check and especially stand up for the employees underneath them instead of throwing them under the bus to 
save themselves. Management needs to learn more about products, processes, and areas they're over so they can be better informed 
when making changes and communicating with their employees. Management needs to understand that proper training is crucial to
 solid work output and is a far better than giving minimal training. Focus less on how pretty the buildings look and more on
 functionality and practicality.

Advice to Management
1. Invest in better management. Just because someone is top of the leaderboards doesn't mean they are going to be the best leaders. Managers stop progression and promotions of talented sales reps because they simply ""don't like them."" Hold them to a higher standard.
2. Focus on inclusion. All of my former coworkers who could be deemed unique or different were never fully accepted. When team members brought up the idea of recruiting more minorities and women, the idea was laughed at and brushed off in meetings with leaders. There is literally no plan to include all kinds of people in this company - very rare for a tech company. If you're a person of color or a woman, please think before you work here.
3. Race Issues. There were many incidents that were never addressed and it made the workplace highly uncomfortable. For instance, multiple white employees would use the n word and say problematic things as ""jokes"" in front of managers. Nothing was done. When the n word was written on the walls in the men's bathroom, the news went around the floor but leadership never addressed it. This was a weak and cowardice move.
4. Pay your people!!! You can't expect someone to work for a tech giant like HPE and get paid like they're at a start-up. If someone is being promoted, you have to compensate them fairly, not ignore their pleas. Also, pay people for all of their closed opportunities. It's not my job to calculate my commission check yet I was continuously doing the math and having to be ""rightfully paid"" for checks months late. This is why nobody stays here longer than a year or so here. You just get sick of the mistreatment and lack of progression.
5. Leaders not wanted. They only want submissive leaders here. If you have ideas or are looking to make a difference, they will get rid of you or put you a performance plan or threaten you with a bad territory/leads. Most leaders leave for this reason quickly.

Advice to Management
1) Figure out comp. Continuously screwing people out of their money is one of the main reasons you can’t keep sales people for longer than a year.

2) Hire managers/directors and promote MORE CAREFULLY. Lots of bullying. The SMB team is by far the worst of the inside sales organization. SMB leaders take pride in tearing their employees down. They’re full of empty promises and lies. If you ask the same question a few days apart, you could get different answers. They are incredibly manipulative. If you speak up about concerns or struggles of any sort, they will flip it back on you and make you feel less of a person or guilty. All they want are “yes” men. There are many managers that have no business being managers.

3) Take HR cases more seriously. If a woman comes forward about sexual harassment, DO NOT make her feel like it was her fault. Address the situation and don’t sweep it under the rug.

Advice to Management
Look at the talent right in front of you and stop looking for answers by blinding feeling out new interns that are literally along for a short ride and not the long term haul. You're losing employees that know multiple job positions because of the social club mentality going on here. When you have something that works, don't try to fix it by replacing it with something else that costs millions and usually isn't any better.
