Wed Dec 23 2020,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Great place to work,0,"It is a great job to maintain while in college they work with your schedule and have great benefits
","It can be a bit tiring lots of physical movement but a great place to work.
Helpfu",,5.0,,,,,,,,
Tue Jul 22 2014, Barista,,Former Employee ,Great company if you can handle it,927,"The benefits are out of sight. I was offered Starbucks stock after my first year, as well as 401k through Fidelity, and a superb Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. You can cover your whole family with that plan, and it can include domestic partners. I got a pound of free coffee every week and free coffee all day (although I think that was specific to my store, which bent the rules). There's also an Employee Assistance Hotline which you can call if you're having issues in your personal life. And HR is really responsive--they won't see you as a troublemaker if you're legitimately having an issue. They will handle it.

Also, sexual orientation and gender identity are included in their anti-discrimination policy. None of the gay or lesbian people on my staff got crap for it, even though about half the staff was quietly conservative Christian and Republican.

If you're a people person, you develop relationships with the regulars and it's fun to make their day. I felt it was pretty rewarding to make drinks. I loved the artistic side of it. And again, the free coffee...just awesome. 

They're also usually pretty flexible about scheduling, so it's ideal for if you're working two jobs or are a student. I worked with people in their 50's who had their own careers, but worked part-time at Starbucks for the health insurance. 

The vacation time system is also pretty sweet. I worked with a guy who was there for 10 years and took like a month vacation to his home country. 

The staffs can be really tight...or they can be really vicious. But a spirit of teamwork is definitely encouraged. And exemplary work is recognized.

In an 8-hour shift you get three breaks: one 30-minute clock-out lunch, and two 10-minute on the clock breaks.

You'll also occasionally get those amazing customers and you live for seeing them. We had four customers who every year each put 100 bucks in our tip jar around Christmas. Sometimes those people can make your day with the things they say and do.
","If you work at a store worth their salt they will work you to the bone. Especially in a large or high-volume store there is so much to do, so much to clean. A morning shift person will have the absolutely insanity of a morning rush, but an evening person should be expected to handle evening rushes with a limited staff as WELL as get the place spotless in what I believe is not a reasonable time. We could get the place clean by 10:45, all right--if we broke the health and corporate rules about when to tear things down. And of course if that was ever found out we were in deep. And if we went over 10:45 we were also in trouble. Management sometimes has some very unrealistic ideas about what the job actually entails and what rules and boundaries should go with that.

The pay in my state starts near minimum wage. The ceiling for a barista is $10/hr, which you hit when you've been there about five years. But tips help, and some high-volume affluent stores will have tips up to $4/hr.

There's also a tendency to have fanatical management. Other ""kindly"" corporations like Whole Foods have this too--the managers drink the Kool-Aid and worship the company. I once spoke with my manager because my schedule was being changed with less than 24 hours notice, and that was against state law. She got this crazed look in her eye and spat ""Starbucks law goes above state law!"" But that's only a tendency. There are some pretty cool managers out there. Mine was insane.

The customers are spoiled rotten so they also get kind of unreasonable about their Starbucks. They will stand there and demand that you make a drink five times because there's still foam on that latte and they said NO foam, not LIGHT foam. This is a business model of Starbucks': everyone is special, and we will bend the rules for everybody. And I've had people scream at me and call me a (b) and promise me that they would make me lose my job. I've also had stuff thrown at me. But, that's also just customer service.

These last few years Starbucks has been obsessed with selling, too. There's a lot of pressure on the staff to make sure people go home with $15 bags of coffee and sub-par espresso machines. It's hard to maintain the relationships they want us to maintain while trying to sell stuff.

Overall, if you can put up with the customers and the physical demand, and if benefits are more important than income, do it. It's rewarding in its own way. Wear insoles.

Listen to your baristas more. High volume stores are held at too high a standard with customer connections. We don't always have time to have conversations with customers when our wait time is half an hour. Expanding the bar area in smaller, high volume stores would enable more baristas to work more efficiently.

","Dealing with hundreds of busy people on their way to work before they've had caffeine can be very stressful!

Advice to Management
Listen to your employees. Every month we send in responses to your surveys and it seems as if ALL the feedback is ignored. If corporate has to work from home due to the pandemic, why do you allow your minimum wage employees to get potentially exposed to the virus? And TRUST ME, a lot of us have gotten the virus.

There is room to grow at Starbucks, if you want to move up, my managers have made it very easy and accessible to anyone who has the drive for it.
","Customers have gotten a lot more emotional and demanding since the start of the pandemic, and have no issue pushing your boundaries or walking over you. Often times it feels like you are not respected or appreciated by the public. People are more likely to leave a negative review than to leave a positive one. Starbucks has their 3rd place policy, but no decent person is going to listen to you politely reciting company policies, when all they care about is themselves and their cup of coffee. They expect you to bend over backwards for them to matter how nice and cordial you are, and they take advantage of your hospitality and kindness just to pacify them.
Advice to Management
We all know the customer is not always right. Sometimes baristas are afraid to stand their ground and establish boundaries with rude customers because they are afraid of getting in trouble. More training/support to management would be helpful so that baristas feel comfortable sticking up for themselves.

","I worked on the 34 Street Macy's Starbucks so I feel like my experience wasn't what the typical store would be. Everyday we had a rush of customers and had to deal with a lot of language barriers due to all the tourists. The training I received was adequate which made the job bearable, however no amount of training could prepare you for the volume of customers that visit Starbucks on the regular and the entitlement of some. While there were plenty of opportunities to pick up or change shifts, which made it easier to make money, the output of work in comparison to the checks wasn't worth the daily exhaustion that would seep into the next shift.

","The company expects way too much from you and it's it or miss with store managers. Starbucks wants you to connect with the customer on a personal level but also get drinks out in record time? And then get upset with the baristas when customers do not rate us highly on our customer connection score -- which is scored in an entirely arbitrary way that means nothing at all. I could go on forever about the stupid customer connection score. Anyways, in my 4 years I've had 6 different store managers and they vary greatly. Managers who have worked their way up from barista are the best and truly understand the pain of being a barista. My last manager was an outside hire and only cared about climbing the corporate latter. Very fake attitude and it hard to work with. They spent most of their time spewing fake positivity which just annoyed all the partners and many customers too. Customers and ever our district manager could tell it was all an act. They were very good with scheduling though, I will give them that.
Advice to Management
Stop pushing ""the Starbucks values"" and actually focus on what's working well for your specific store and customer base. Times change and most customers aren't in the mood for mindless smalltalk. And they especially don't want intrusive questions when it's clear it's all to up the customer connection scores.

Our store's top priority was to have better numbers and faster times than the other local stores, rather than taking our time and producing better products. I was in high school when working this position and repeatedly asked for a schedule change as I was unable to work the times they put me down for with my school hours, but they were not changed, and I was reprimanded more than once for coming late to shifts even though I was 17 and still in school.

Advice to Management
Split the managerial workload with an assistant.
Make an assistant manager position a permanent position. I’m a firm believer in this. I’ve always given 150% and I’m certain you’d see a huge improvement on SM turnover, as well as the rest of the staff.

- Management: You may find shift supervisors or store managers who are micromanaging or being dismissive. These issues contribute to partners leaving this store. However, there are a few managers who are good and easy-going (congrats if you find one).
- Customers: Not all of them are rude and aggressive, but there are many cases that you have to deal with them.
- Lots of preparations and cleaning. It's like one person has to do everything during busy hours. So basically, lack of teamwork.
Advice to Management
I understand Starbucks is doing the best to maintain a safe workplace during COVID19, but there are issues to concern. When the managers are using a playbook to run the store, but where is the Customer Support? It is critical when partners need more supplies during busy hours, and it is ridiculous that we don't have the same role. We need more people on the floor to finish the to-do list if you want to keep the store clean. 

None of the store managers or shift supervisors give partners a clear explanation about the mask policy. When customers didn't wear masks (correctly), we need to ask them to have them. However, there are a few people doing it because the same managers remind them not to ""police"" them? This contradicts the store policy and discourages partners to do their jobs. It will be helpful if they demonstrate themselves.

And for the straws, maybe the managers should let customers pick them up at the counter. I saw many customers reaching out to the straws when they need them. I don't understand why we need to keep the straws away from the same customers and let them touch the straws? It contradicts the store rules and defeats the safety purpose.

And, last but not least, raise their wages. People work hard and want to strive for themselves, but $9/hr is not enough to support themselves.

Advice to Management
The manager at my store had been a manager for over 20 years. He wasn't much of a manager any more, although I was told he used to be. I think he was burned out. I can't tell you how many days 3 employees would show up when there were supposed to be 5. This is one of the busiest Starbucks in the city. That resulted in terrible stress as we tried to deliver on all of our objectives while being so short-staffed. Pay your employees a better wage.
