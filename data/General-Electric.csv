The people were nice, we had permissive leave so I took roughly 5 weeks vacation per year and never heard any complaints from the management. It was super corporate, but I attribute that as the reason why they could pamper us so well.
","They closed the office as a whole and laid off the 100 or so employees. This was a result of the long term effects of Covid-19. That said, GE does have a very real philosophy of looking at the numbers and cutting costs in any way possible, even if it's heartless and short sighted. I realize this is standard for any company this large, but as a result of it, any long term employee there is well aware that they need to shift their position regularly to match whatever is the most profitable side of the business at the time. The only thing you can count on at GE is CHANGE.

","GE has an elitist culture. It's part of the reason for their current turmoil. They promote and encourage employees that they believe are from high society or higher socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background.

Finally, there are a lot of layoffs. It's nerve-wracking to work there, never knowing which department they will completely dissolve next.

Reduce the number of managers. When my coworker and I would have team calls for the small hospital we worked in, it would be the 2 of us on a call with up to 6 supervisors/managers. Three of those management positions were completely unnecessary. When it came time to trim costs during Covid they get rid of the workers and keep the higher paid managers.

Wed Feb 26 2020, Accountant,"Cincinnati, OH",Current Employee ,Join a career accelerating program,1,"1. Unlimited PTO, you just have to get it approve by your manager.
2. In most offices (if not all), have a relaxed dress code. Not having to dress in business casual is a bigger deal than you may think. It would be hard for me to work with a company that doesn't have a relaxed dress code now.
3. Great work flexibility
","1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above.
2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 
3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE.
Advice to Management
1. Focus more on employees who aren't in advancement programs. A lot of good employees leave because they feel over looked. 
2. Pay the people in the advancement programs less, allow more people to work remotely, or allow less travel, so you don't have to move so many finance and accounting jobs to India and Mexico. 
3. Help employees with career development like job related certifications.

","No work balance, global teams force required work odd hours, understaffed. US engineers have to cover for lack of knowledge due to constant turn over at global places since GE is not competitive globally. Global places are covered by labor laws by limited hours and guarantied vacation that has to be compensated but US engineers with long unpaid hours as result US salary people also do not take adequate vacation. Very high stress as ""beating continues until moral improves"". Company constantly chipping away benefits. Limited - not competitive 401k investment choices. Matching company contribution is payed at the end of the year another chip of benefits so if somebody leave before end of the year they do not have to pay it. Low chance of promotion in USA as GE moves more and more engineering to global places.

Tue Jul 09 2019, Senior Director,,Former Employee ,Focus,0,"Great location, fantastic people, tackling IIoT problems worth solving.
","Too many strategy pivots -- seems like every day we were pursuing a different set of customers and had different product goals. A highly political, large organization organized in large centralized ""empires"" silos, without a great deal fo urgency or agility. Often slow to complete projects and show forward momentum, preferring over-documentation to delivering business value. Engineering makes all product decisions, while UX is working on cute animations, and Product is busy doing sales.
Advice to Management
FOCUS. Stop having Engineering run (and ruin) everything -- allow Product, SMEs, and UX to do their job. Stop trying to over-design and over-build everything, instead focus on adding immediate business value to IIoT customers quickly in specific use cases (here is where Product, SMEs, and UX -- NOT Engineering -- will help you figure out what you need to build). Leverage existing frameworks instead of (re)building everything in-house. Reorganize using small, cross-functional agile ""Tiger Teams"" with specific deliverables and measures of success. Stop chasing ""whales"" and instead use Product, SME, and UX expertise to discover what market needs then execute to the MVP for smaller and mid-size customers. After the bugs are worked out these solutions can be combined into bundled offerings.

Thu Jun 06 2019, Senior Software Engineer,"New Orleans, LA",Former Employee ,Couldn't care less about their employees,1,"Paychecks are always deposited on time, and affinity groups are many. That's about all I can think of for pros.
","GE in New Orleans claims to have a startup feel despite being a corporate operation, but this couldn't be farther from the truth. Honesty is rare and decisions are motivated by political or individual reasons. Engineers are treated like numbers instead of people. Product work is reassigned often and rarely comes to completion with the same resources it started with, so pride in ones work is virtually impossible to attain. Financial difficulties pushed annual increases off indefinitely. Those selected for layoff and those who are underpaid often have many years of tenure over brand new employees who are kept or compensated better. Loyalty and commitment mean nothing to leadership. Focus on career advancement is non-existent, and there are no roles available for moving up. Medical benefits for family are highly expense yet the annual deductible is ridiculously high.
Advice to Management
Stop worrying about yourselves and put some thought into decisions that impact those you're responsible for. Also, put some energy into challenging antiquated HR policies that prevent you from compensating and valuing your employees.

Clannish toxic environment. Hope to find a trust worthy person because people will smile your face and try to ruin your career. Management looks the other way. Lots of people in position of authority who are incompetent, rude & disrespectful. This type of attitude& behavior is rewarded. 

Top heavy management. Will lay off the people who do the work and add another C- suite position that dies nothing
Advice to Management
Heed the sign of times. The state of the company is a result of the behavior and historical mismanagement.

After 6 months I am being told that I have 22 days vacation time! I feel like being cheated, the company that can not stand by its words speaks volumes about its ethics. 
- It's stressful to work at GE with no benefits as such, to a point that I suffered from stress induced acute anxiety at work and have to be on medications. Even for attending my daughter's event for an hour I was pointed out and told to take PTO while many just loiter at work place for hours or WFH while they work at other places on that day. I complained to the HR but all they did was pacification and no action on my request to change my boss/ relocate to another team.

Two trends that made it a different company than the one I joined in '89. 1) Selection of leaders became waaayyyyy more subjective and based on pedigree and personal relationships than on credibility with the workforce and good leadership skills. 2) The company's values shifted sharply to the left after Jeff I took over, and never moved back to the center, at least while I was there.

","Things changed when Jeff Immelt came and took charge and totally screwed up GE, he did not do what was best for the company, nor did the board of directors. They kept the problem going on for over 16 years. Replacing Immelt and not giving John Flannery enough time to fix a 16 year mess was wrong.
There is still a good ole boys network and not enough women are promoted. GE talks diversity but their actions don't always show that. Obviously the executives don't lead by example, they still spend money and cut everyone else from spending. It should be across the board. Expect to always worry about layoffs and to keep getting more and more work assigned to you as more people are cut.
Advice to Management
After 39 years, this is not the GE I started with. I was embarassed at the end to say I worked for this company. Would I suggest someone go work there, no, I would tell them if they want a work balance, look some where else as GE is not the only game in town. Listen to your employees, they know what needs to be done and they go above and beyond to make things better. Stop being top heavy in the organization as that is what got the business in trouble.

","1. Cut throat culture because of the forced ranking system.

2. GE transportation offices in Erie, Pa are absolutely filthy. There are insect droppings and diesel soot all over the office area.

3. The offices are old and decrepit. There is a shortage of office space. Interns and senior engineers are crammed into tiny cubicles called efficiencies. Overall it reminds me of a Bangladeshi garment factory rather than a modern American Corporation

4. I don't understand how OSHA let's them get away with it.

5. Absolutely no empathy towards employees. I know an injured worker who was recovering after surgery with an injured hand and they would not give him work from home or provide flex time. He had to drive 20 miles to work in the Pennsylvania winter using one hand.

6. He was put on a PIP (performance improvement plan) which was simply unachievable and then fired with no severance.

7. Technologically they are way behind their competitors.

8. Absolutely unethical company. The government agencies protect them for the business they bring in.

9. Company future looks bleak. Just look at their stock price performance compared to their peers such as Caterpillar.

10. You can get a better package overall at Caterpillar with half the stress.

","This office is struggling to create its own culture. There is close to no senior leadership on site and the lack of leadership is palpable. They opened a new facility to be in the biotech hub and are so desperate to fill roles they rush to fill them and don't hire the right talent. This creates an office of unqualified people, bad culture, lack of leadership, extremely high turnover. Turnover is so high, it results in you are either always doing 2 jobs, or cross-training a new higher... it's exhausting. It's the blind leading the blind there. During recruiting, they will try to spin it like this: ""great opportunity to be in Life Sciences industry, be part of biotech"", but I would not recommend anyone I like to work there. GE likes to hire cheap, so most people are under 30, inexperienced, with high millennial expectations, thinking the world owes them everything and they don't need to work for anything. Most people I worked with said that they were sold a job completely different from what the role actually ended up being. The business is run in a ""make the current quarter"" mentality where they do anything to make the current quarter revenue numbers. HR is offsite and extremely useless. Given GE's overall problems as well, I would steer clear of working for GE in any capacity.

Advice to Management
Career opportunities are limited within GE given our current environment so the value prop needs to be well articulated as to why employees should continue working here.

","In recent years, business decisions are being made for short term gains. There is undue pressure on suppliers, rather than seeing them as partners in providing the product. Finding a good manager is critical to success, because the wrong manager can change one's entire experience.
Advice to Management
A global business should not be quite so ""Schenectady-centric,"" particularly with all the technology that is available to employees. Many good employees are lost because they choose not to live in upstate NY, for a myriad of reasons.

","Management often creating shortages of parts and supplies, then pointing the finger at the people doing the ""actual work,"" in an effort to cover their many shortcomings. Integrity, honesty, and reasonable treatment of employees is severely deficient. They were slowly and systematically doing whatever they could to try and make this plant ""look like"" it was inefficient in a concerted effort to outsource production and force people to be laid off in order to weaken the union.
Advice to Management
There is literally nothing that can be said to encourage the management of this place to do right by the workers or the community that their hard earned dollars are being taken from. Greed has no empathy, integrity, sense of honor or loyalty. Your stock continues to perform dismally because of the damage that has already been done, and that shame is solely on the management to own.
