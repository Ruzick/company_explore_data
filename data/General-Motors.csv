Push business users/partners to get on-board with incremental development; don't expect finalized products with every deployment. Stop suggesting developers can't be productive when not watched and micro-managed. Show more trust in those with proven track records. Provide more information about internal positions instead of requiring volunteers with no guarantee of position or work to be done.

Thu Jan 28 2021, Entry Level Software Developer,"Warren, MI",Current Employee ,New College Hire Program - Bait and Switch,1,"Extensive training for new college hires through their Career Start Academy
Decent starting pay for entry level, with a great 10% (target / variable) end of year bonus and a solid 401k match.
New college hire program seems to offer a faster than average pay increase year over year with a grade increase at the end of the program, incentivizing new hires to stay on board.
","The new college hire program is a bit of a mess. I applied an interviewed for a ""Entry Level Software Developer"" roll and got stuck doing IT operations. The interview and several conversations with my hiring manager seemed to obfuscate the fact that I was not being placed on a development team until my first day on the job. While GM does offer free resources for self learning, I fear skill drain in this current position. Many other new college hires I have spoken with also feel they were ""bait and switched"". People that actually landed development roles form this opening seem to be an exception rather than the rule, which makes this whole situation seem intentional. This is a bit of a slap in the face to people with CS and CE degrees that hoped to apply the skills they just learned in school, but instead get stuck doing sys admin work that anyone with a solid tech background could be trained to do.
Advice to Management
GM appears to be investing heavily in early-career talent. I was hired in as part of this their new college hire program, an initiative that saw the influx of several hundred other early career hires at the same time as me. I applied for a role titled ""Entry Level Software Developer"" and was interviewed for the roll as if it were a development position. When I was given my job offer, I was told I was in GM IT, but my roll was still ""Entry Level Software Developer"". I was a bit confused by this, so I asked my soon-to-be boss what the job entailed and received a very vague answer, but was still under the impression I would be doing software work. So my first day rolls around, and It becomes apparent I am on a DevOps team. While this is fine with me for the time being, as a new hire I am sure to be the one taking up a lot of the operations side of the job. I feel like I have been duped. My job definitely isnt as a software dev, and with a Computer Engineering degree, I feel like I wasted years and time on a degree that is completely unnecessary for this job. While I am grateful to have a decent paying job right out of college in the current global climate, I feel I am being under utilized, and I feel like I was lied to.

Be better. If your employees are better than you at your own job (and you know the ones that are) step down and let the big boys take over. Go to sleep because you are only ruining the brand. Admit when you can’t handle the big leagues, demote yourself, let the pros make the most money. We will hold your hand and run you back through the process so maybe you can hang again one day.

In my opinion folks that have been there for over 20 years (and sometimes less than that) are too stuck in their ways and too conservative. To some extent I think the culture contributes to this way of thinking.

I am also concerned GM is doing things like they did in the old days by trying to tell customers what they should be buying rather than just making what they want.

Laboriously repetitive work.

The utterly unfair treatment of temps.
Having to be forced to work (90 days no time off) in times of “emergency” for the company. 
Having to work two Saturdays in a row to get one off.
Buildings have TERRIBLE temperature control. Absolutely swelteringly hot in the summers and freezing ice cold in the winter.
Takt times often depend on the cohesiveness of your fellow team members. If you have a lousy team expect difficulties both personal and professional.
The union is supposed to fight for you, but often they are a let down in many aspects. Union Representatives are lazy and put in the minimum effort to fight for you. Make sure you vote for representatives that you want to support you during elections.

The workers are actual people with families and lives once they leave their shift.

Get off your high horse and be a good leader not a dictator.

Vehicle Engineering TRACK program enables you to experience different areas of the company without committing to a single department/position for 2 years.
","Overall, not a great environment to work in. Vehicle Engineering TRACK program has changed so rotations are only ~6 months which does not allow you to be part of any meaningful projects. Depending on the group you are in, you are treated more like a student/intern but as an entry-level recent college graduate, you are required to do the 2-year program first. Expectation from upper management to work around the clock, even though they say they are all about work-life balance. If you want to perform well, you have to work at least 50-60 hours per week. Plus, managers move around every 2-3 years so there is very little consistency or support for the people on the bottom. Also, many people become managers who significantly lack leadership / communication / people skills. There is minimal diversity in the company, despite all the publicity that GM is diverse. Don't expect a warm welcome if you are a POC or LGBT+, especially if you work with/in manufacturing. Promotions seem to be related to who you know, not how much good quality work you do. Similarly, if you are a slacker, you can get by for years without being fired. During my few years there, I have experienced layoffs and UAW strikes, and told by multiple old-timers that this is typical and expected every few years.
Advice to Management
Lift up the people doing the brunt of the work. Keep managers in roles longer to improve efficiency at all levels of the organization. Require managers to take leadership / communication training and be evaluated more regularly and consistently. Put more action behind your words.

 - Ironically, I've seen people with a development background placed in a non-development team, and people without a development background in a development team.

If you are looking to grow as a software developer, I would avoid entry level positions at General Motors, because you will most likely not do any software development.

Additionally, moving horizontally to another team is impossible, despite how proactive you are in networking with other teams. You are essentially locked in your team, on average, three years it seems like. I've seen plenty of entry level software developers in the company for 0 to 3 years, not doing any software development.

Please don't trick people into thinking they will be doing software development, when you need manual/repetitive grunt-work to be done for the company. Attrition rate would be much lower, if you matched people who like to do manual/repetitive work vs people who like to innovate.

Advice to Management
Pay more attention to your entry level employees. I rarely would ever talk to my manager. Even though he would set up weekly team meetings (I'm pretty sure this was only because of COVID though), I didn't have a real relationship with him. I would go weeks without hearing from him. Obviously GM is a big company so I understand not every manager can sit there and baby/pay attention to their employees. However, if GM wants to call this an ""College Graduate IT Program"", make sure you put college grads with Managers that have the time to actually GUIDE them and help them early on in their career. Compared to my other entry level role at another Fortune 500 company and my internships, I often times felt like I had no guidance or anyone to look up to/talk to/learn from. 
**If you are looking for a good IT rotational program that starts you off a higher starting salary, will provide you with more guidance, structure and mentorship as well as an actual group or ""Class"" or new hires you can relate to, I HIGHLY suggest you apply to Ford. ** 

At my time doing development work at GM, I rarely had any senior developers or even mid level developers to help guide me. I joined the team with no Java/Angular expierence, and handed this massive project that was a mess and expected to figure out how to navigate it. Which is fine in normal circumstances, but again, without any help or guidance at ALL (literally there were NO other developers at certain points, other than another college graduate who knew as much as I did...) how am I expected to learn what good development practices in the industry look like? What is the point in calling the program a college graduate program if there is not going to be any guidance within my role either? There's a difference between being thrown in head first vs just blindly trying to figure things out. It was SOO stressful at times when technical decisions or technical problems come up and you only have two new college graduates there to try and figure it out...without any help from any one with more experience. 3 Senior developers joined and left the project I was on, within a 6 month span... and I'm sure it was for a good reason too. 

The technology stack was also just not up to industry standard. I'm sure there are parts of GM that are actually working with cutting edge technology, but clearly not in GM Finance. The project I was put on, that claimed to be ""Agile"" and had 4-5 week sprints... Just having standup meetings twice a day and having backlog planning planning and retros isn't the only thing that makes something ""AGILE"", just an FYI. 

Lastly, the community aspect of GM is just lacking. Everybody shows up to work to work and that's it -- personally, I enjoy a work environment with some FUN or the chance to get to connect with my coworkers on a better level. 

TLDR; if you are looking for a role where you will get the guidance/support a new graduate needs to become a good developer GM is not the company to work at. Save yourself the trouble and apply to Ford.

I worked at General Motors (GM) full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Great vacation, 401K matching, and bonus. I joined as a college-hire, and they teach you everything on the job. While still behind the tech industry, GM is developing competitive, cloud-centric IT platforms. There is a lot of opportunity to learn the work that adjacent roles do and pickup skills outside your immediate function. It is almost impossible to get fired. If you are still developing your IT skills, this is an ideal first job.
","Lack of senior talent. I heard Randy Mott (CIO) directly say that GM will continue to prioritize recruiting new-hires from college over retaining mid-level employees. After the three years of being a college-hire, you become a ""real"" low-level employee that gets a senior dev workload with junior dev pay and little or no mentorship. Your annual performance rating is based on a behind-closed-doors ranking of all employees of the same level - manager favorites get raises and better bonuses. Management is cliqued-up based on their previous employers; the key to success in GMIT is getting in the right club.
Advice to Management
I enjoyed that in a tough social climate, (while they didn't always hit the nail on the head) upper-management tried to do the right thing and make change in the company; keep doing that.

Thu Aug 06 2020,Anonymous,"Atlanta, GA",Current Employee ,Below Average Salary,0,"Benefits are good. 401k match is good but gets vested after 2 years which is unfortunate cause it isn't worth sticking around for 2 years.
","If you want to work on anything remotely interesting this isn't really the place.
The salary is way below average. I joined as part of their recent college grad program and didn't have much choice but to accept GM's offer because I needed a job. After covid-19 hit we got a 20% salary cut so I started looking for a new job as the pay wasn't good to begin with. I've accepted an offer at another company that is twice my current salary. After giving my 2 week notice I was told I need to repay my relocation expenses right away despite telling HR that I don't have the money because I've been struggling with the 20% salary cut. GM is just another corporation that doesn't really care about the employees at the end of the day. We're just another cog in the money making machine.
Layoffs are always looming over your head. When I joined there was a wave of layoffs and about half of the employees at my location were let go. You'd hear stories about how everyone would line up in their cubicles just watching as one by one people were picked out to leave. Since those layoffs there's been a strike from the factory workers and GM has taken huge losses as a result of covid-19 so another wave of layoffs is sure to come. They've been hiring college grads like crazy at below market costs so I'm pretty sure they're setting themselves up to let the higher paid employees go soon.

","Work feels like it goes at a snail's pace. It has mismanaged things, such as skimping on a laptop. In an effort to ""save"" money, they will give a software engineer the same laptop they give HR. This, for example, causes one to waste more time waiting on the PC that could have been spent actually being productive. The time overall spent ends up costing more in salary than if they had just bought a good laptop. This isn't the only ""cost cutting"" (I use this partially facetiously) strategy they have used that has backfired or otherwise caused decrease quality of life for engineers. Their transition from Rational Synergy to Git is another that comes to mind.

Thu Jun 25 2020, Software Developer,,Current Employee ,Not worth it for freshers,2,"No micromanagement depending on who you work under and good opportunity to relocate with the generous relocation package. Decent benefits.
","You get placed randomly into a department/team as a new college hire. The 3 week long mandatory training is worthless and you'll have to self-teach yourself a lot to prepare for the work you'll be doing. You'll either find yourself doing nothing most of the time or stuck into doing things you've not been prepared/trained to do.

There's an odd social hierarchy formed on job positions. Us ""lower level"" employees sit there and listen while the higher position employees talk above us in conference calls. Weirdest social environment I've ever been in. Depending on the team you get placed on it can be toxic.

There's very little room for professional/career development with a lot of folks still not promoted or moved up after they put in years. If you have other job offers, I suggest you weigh out the pros and cons because you will not learn, develop, grow, or move up in GM unless you become friends with upper management. At the minimum, you have to stay 3 years for full benefits (401k contributions and to nullify relocation package recollections).

Sun May 24 2020, Software Engineer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,The Career Lottery in a Mediocrity kingdom,5,"Good work life balance, amazing vacation days, amazing benefits. College hire program maintains 4.4% raises every 6 months, with your last raise being 10% (sometimes more if your manager fights for you but this will rarely happen).

Great work life balance; think less than 35 hours work weeks because most people won't notice who you are or how long you've been in the office. I've had a coworker who routinely took 4 hour lunches, and slept in his chair; it took him 1 year to get ""let go"" (he moved to another company after being pushed out), so it's very hard to get fired unless they are having routine layoffs like a few years ago.

Laid back environment. Deadlines don't realistically matter - everything gets pushed back so very little stress.

They're trying to be better and work with newer coding languages, which is nice. They've heavily invested in CI/CD and cloud software for easy deployments.
","After graduating the new college hire program, opportunities for advancement require 5+ additional years of experience, each year only gives inflation raises until you've proven your worth and ""loyalty."" This leaves majority of people to leave after 3-4 years because the time spent vs the promotion advances are not worth it. Likewise, this means almost all your fellow employees are newly hired workers, little to none senior devs to be found, and if the senior devs are good, they are overworked. 

Management is non-existent, I would say majority (unless you're lucky with a good manager) don't care about your career or how you progress, only butts in seats, you are basically treated like a number in a spreadsheet. This is probably because of the age of the company - a lot of old souls who don't like change.

4 out of the 6 managers I've had in 3 years (a lot right?), have all the left the company.

It's also a roll of the dice if you get on a good team or not. The politics in the company is a big reason why management end up leaving.

You have to play the politics game to get promoted. But none of these cons are limited to General Motors, just typical big company pains.

Mon Mar 02 2020, Software Developer,"Roswell, GA",Current Employee ,"Mediocre, Mediocre, Mediocre.",8,"- Great benefits
- Often fairly relaxed
- Most coworkers are fairly nice
- Looks great on your resume
","- GM has a culture of mediocrity that seeps through in everything it does. I've met a few sharp colleagues here; but I've met just as many who are barely capable of using a computer, much-less performing their job.
- The people in tech leadership positions often tend to be more incompetent than the grunts, and this can lead to drama and politics.
- The business is Waterfall, and the Agile practices followed by developers are purely ceremonial.
- No amount of extra effort will ever get you recognized -- if anything, it will get you in trouble. It doesn't matter that you've worked far more hours and far more efficiently than many of your coworkers; you look the same to the company as the guy who works 6 hours a day, overestimates his tasks, and lies on his timesheets.
- Overperforming makes you a threat, and *will* be met with retribution. Do not depend on the ""no-retaliation"" policy.
- If you don't lie on metrics, you will be crushed by those that do.
- Outdated tech stack.
- Incompetent, infuriating UX teams.
- Incompetent, infuriating business.
- Incompetent facilities.
- Incompetent, political management.
- Uncompetitive base pay.
- Teams are completely, irrevocably siloed.
- Awareline is a joke.
- Incompetent leaders are transferred instead of fired.
- If you're a senior developer, you'll probably be the first to go when there's a layoff.
- Things happen at a glacial pace. This is just the nature of a large company like GM.
- The company is all talk and no action.
Advice to Management
Nothing I say will ever make a difference.

(GM is a massive bureaucracy several times the size of several countries' entire populations. This is a job you take if you want to be a faceless drone working for the Man, writing mediocre code in outdated technologies that's *just* good-enough to not attract attention.)
(It's also a job you take if you're fresh out of college and want to get some experience in the real world.)
(It's not a job you take if you want to be challenged, or if you do your best at everything you do.)

Depending on the team you're on, the work can be pretty easy, sometimes unchallenging, or exciting and demanding.

Managers I have had are really lenient with the work-from-home policy, so the work schedule is pretty flexible most of the time, which is a plus.

Overall benefits are decent, but not top-notch.

","The purpose of the college hire program is to give them experience and have them leave before the 3 years to a mid-level position is complete. If they don't leave, they are forced out. When GM undergoes an automobile downturn, they fire employees who did good work for them for years, sometimes even more than 5-10 years. Most of the seniors, tech leads, developers, and college hires have left. Last year, GM fired many people in front of their own colleagues. There is favoritism by certain managers intentionally giving out negative reviews so those favorite managers can keep their job. The hr and favorite managers are doing a terrible job. The culture is so bad. Fairness is gone and when they fire you because of their automobile downturn they turn it on their former employees.

It's really important to meet different managers within the company, and it's pretty easy to do that.

Make a stronger effort to modernize management and encourage flexible work in groups that are stuck with traditional mentality. Working from home should be encouraged more, especially without the distractions of the movement towards ""open office"". Allow people to transition to other departments without having to depend fully on their manager giving them permission. This is much easier with the rotational program for recent college grads, but it can be difficult sometimes for people outside of rotations to move out of departments that tend to struggle with recruiting new people.

There is still fluff in IT. We could do a lot more with smaller cross functional teams. We don't have time for dealing with lackluster effort with the negative externalities (trade war, strike, etc) impacting us. We need to do more. We could be more.

","1. Low pay compare to similar industry.

2. With all the profit and tax incentives that General Motors gained over the years, the company is still at a brink of bankruptcy due to the executives/management self allocating wealth for themselves and spending miss management at the very top.

3. The workplace culture at GM was merely a fraternity of white managers who only seek to elevate those that shared similar ethnicity. While diversity, and especially within the IT Innovation team is a joke! The leadership and management absolutely have not a single person of color man or woman at the top leadership position. If you are looking for an organization to make a paycheck then sure the GM IT organization will be ideal. However, if advancement into a leadership role is your priority, that GM IT is not the workplace of choice that I would recommend.

Sun Nov 03 2019, Software Developer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Great work environment - Austin North Campus,1,"I started three months ago. I enjoy going to work everyday. I’m new to Austin and didn’t know anyone before moving here. My move was completely paid for by GM. I’ve made a tight group of friends at GM and our circle is growing. I haven’t met anyone I’ve disliked or didn’t want to work with. I started with a lot of other new college hires so everyone is kind of in the same situation. I’ve been fortunate in the work that I’ve been doing. It’s pretty much exactly what I wanted, web development. I know others that were placed on a team doing a job that they wanted as well. I’ve done two in person code reviews with senior level guys and those went well. Teams can change and people get moved around based on a manager’s decision/demand. Can be better opportunity but that isn’t always true. They have a recognition program where lead developers can award points. I’ve been awarded points for working hard and identifying pit falls in the project we were working on. That leads me to another point I really appreciate. Since day one my lead developer asked me my opinion on challenges in the current project. In meetings we get a chance for our voice to be heard. Overall I’m really satisfied with my first full time job out of college.
","I know a new college hire that sometimes works till 8 and sometimes on weekends. I don’t know specifics of why but it seems a little off for a new college hire. My biggest complaint would be I wish I was using modern JavaScript frameworks on my team. There is at least one team that does just not mine.

","Any hope of keeping up with modern tech stacks here is minuscule. Most of the company does not do any work on the cloud. When they do, not Azure/AWS but rather PCF. In Austin, the management is full of ex Dell employees that look out for each other. So you end up with engineering managers who probably don't know the first thing about coding basics or current trends in the industry. 

They are also afraid of the business team. Management will lie to your face about being innovative and pushing the envelope. Really what ends up happening is you either take over some old poorly written legacy applications that the business team has no desire to re-write. Or the business team will buy a poorly written COTS product that is not enterprise ready. Finally they are cheap. No benefits like decent laptops (you will get a heavy brick), cafeteria, gym, training outside of new college hires, etc. Company morale was bad after the layoff. Only come work here is you are towards the end of your career and just want something to sail into retirement with. Finally, the employee discounts are a joke. You can bargain yourself that same deal.

- Several opportunities for growth / to climb the corporate ladder
- Yearly profit sharing + previous year performance Bonus
- Salaries are competitive and are often far above the median and what other companies pay for the same position.
- The benefits are what keeps people, even if the job is killing them
","- Each year the first 2 weeks of July is shutdown period. plants shut down and vacation days are mandatory to be used during shutdowns if the business warrants. You often don’t find out if you will be working or not the week or two leading up to shut down period, each year is different. 
- Old company and old employees make progressing into the new age difficult and slow. The culture had changed little, if at all before Mary Barra came in. The workplace culture is significantly behind most other companies but has shown signs of slow improvement in some areas under Mary’s leadership. 
- The outdated culture is typically shown in management styles, leadership styles, employee behaviors, and decision making. 
- Discrimination is a real thing, most of the company including executive leadership, and most higher up leadership roles in the company are run and led by white males. When women or minorities get promoted into such roles, whispers of “they only got that position because they’re XYZ” start to happen. They will put people into positions that are not as qualified as other candidates based on the diversity of the teams current headcount. 70:30 ratio of men and women employees. Women make up the majority of the HR functions (previously known as secretary positions/type of work) of the company. 
- Salaried politics are worse than UAW politics-- and both are the absolute worst part of working here. Nothing gets done efficiently. You are not trusted to make decisions on your own unless XYZKISG have all approved it. 
- Do not disclose if you have an invisible illness disability unless it is absolutely necessary, make sure to document everything going forward once you have disclosed. ADA, disability and FMLA regulations are not always followed or enforced, and it can (in my case it did) hurt or end your career. 
- There is little to no training for new hires, employees, and newly appointed leadership roles. It’s sink or swim, and good luck finding a life vest. 
- Make sure you fit the mold. Dress conservative. Women- hair and make up done. Make GM your life, so you can get 2 months of work done in 2 weeks with no resources. aka put 12-14 hour days in and than go home and work until bed.
-Terrible work life balance. Many obligatory events throughout the year outside of work hours. 
- In operations/plants there are 1st, 2nd, 3rd shift - you do not get to pick which one you work on or for how long
- If you are a attractive, highly motivated, type A personality, Extroverted, or can pick up on corporate politics - you will excel and do well.

Mon Sep 02 2019, Entry Level Software Developer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Good place to start your career but a very bland company.,10,"I was hired during my senior year of college to work at the Austin IT office. I like cars and GM's offer was higher than a couple of others I received so I was excited to start! 

As an entry level employee you get to work on real projects that contribute to the company. If you have the drive and determination you can get recognition and get some extra money!

The pay is good for entry level hires. For your first 3 years, you get 4.4% increases every 6 months as long as you don't screw up!
","The new college hire program for IT is very luck of the draw. You are assigned to a team based on need and not really your skill set. I came in with JAVA skills and was assigned to a team to do web development. 

Also, some of the managers are better than others and once you are assigned at random you don't get to pick. Some of the managers like to micromanage and count bathroom breaks while others are hands off and allow you to work from home when ever you like. I got one in kind of in between which was fine.

They hire a LOT of recent college grads so if you want to get ahead you have to bust your butt. There are not a lot of opportunities for advancements so even if you do bust your butt it is not guaranteed you will get any promotion, this is the main reason I left.

GM as a whole is a very cheap company, so don't be expecting to be trying out the new cars. There are no free meals, no company sponsored parties, and no team outings. If they can save a dollar they will! I often forgot I was working for a car company!
Advice to Management

Most people are talented at the senior/analyst level OR director level.
Great Short-Term (3-5 Year) Resume Builder if young, You can really learn the Politics of a conservative style large corp.
If you live in the Detroit area GM looks good on your resume, they do look for top talent.
","If you come in young without knowing someone (mommy/daddy/grampa/aunt ect is up there in the org) you will have an extremely difficult time getting promoted. Immediately get someone at the director level on your good side! Come in as a 6B, you will get a 10% bump to 6A in a couple years, then if you stay 5-6 years and put in good work you can get another 10% pay bump to a 7th level...then leave on good terms, get mgmt experience somewhere else, come back in 3-5 years as an 8th level by not burning your bridges when you leave! Pretty much the only way finance/CPA personnel can make mgr without waiting 10-15 years after being a 7th level, you will have grey hair by time you get there in the New GM.

HR is kind, but have their hands tied. If you are unlucky and work under a bad level 8 (which there are plenty) they will look at you as a passer by or worse & you will have waisted precious years of learning OR could get “blacklisted” without knowing.

The “good ol boys” club in all the reviews below is entirely real. I am fortunate enough to be in this “clique” (due to many years/connections) but again, promotions are 90% purely political (and now VERY RARE) & you must know a family member or have outside of work connections. Come in as a level 8, Come in as a level 8, come in as a level 8 IF Your Goal is to stay long term.

Company is currently prepping for more layoffs, if you come in now when the vehicle buying cycle is trending down, be prepared for a rough beginning, you will have to work hard (big 4 type hours-no overtime or promotion each year type of life) to earn a higher rating. Next few years, bonuses will be lower due to Macro Economic things going on (tariffs, uaw issues, California lawers coming after the Company’s money, Uncertainty coming from 2020 elections, EPA emission standard battles to come if Democrats take back control-will seriously hurt companies bottom line & this will come out of your paycheck. 

Unless you play politics well, be prepared to be rated average & become stagnant over time (get your GM experience & leave if you come in young like stared above). Also, I’ve noticed (as a woman) that young men, particularly white/asian, are brought in initially with less pay than their female counterparts. This is probably due to the current #metoo culture or CEO, not sure, could just be a legal thing GM wants to cover its bases on. We actually hired a legal firm to ensure women & men were being paid “equally” a few years back...alot of good hard working men kind of got burnt because of this.
Advice to Management
Be honest with employees, don’t give young folks false hope! Tell them candidly to consider leaving if you think they don’t have a chance to progress! Be Leaders, Trainers, to the younger folks so they can grow, don’t get them involved in politics until they are ready & understand the old fashioned nature of the culture. Being older, I hate seeing the “new generation” come in expecting the GM life that their parents/grandparents told them about, it is gone. GM is no longer “that special” to work for anymore-change that! Do more outings, office events, stuff we used to do in the 90’s-we dont have to break cash flow to do a golf outing...

Wed Sep 11 2019, Operations Supervisor,"Rochester Hills, MI",Current Employee ,Great Company to Make Money,0,"Salaried employees working in plants make overtime in addition to their base pay which gives the potential to make tens of thousands of dollar more per year

The health care benefits include vision and dental. There's also an HSA option.
401K Matching is some of the highest out of any of the other large companies.

Most salaried employees are eligible for some type of annual raise even if it's small.
","Plant life it hard and transitioning into a role outside the plant can be very difficult and for some people impossible.

Leadership often tries to steer people's careers in the direction they believe it should go in.

Despite a very large and expensive effort to transform and improve the organizational culture, the effects are not being seen at the plant level. 

The high salary you get for working in the plants comes at a price. We have some of the best health care benefits in the industry because we put out bodies on the line working 7 days a week and sometimes 12 hours a day pounding the concrete. The stress level makes people sick. Many supervisors and managers take sick leave for foot, knee, or hip surgeries. Healthy people under the age of 40 have heart attacks. This work is not for the faint of heart and I don't believe it's meant to be done for more than 5 to 7 years.

","There is still a lot of the culture that was described in the Velukas report left at GM. It's very difficult to work around silos if you end up in a role that is horizontal.

GM calls itself a tech company but I hear complaints daily from my coworkers about how they wish GM was more like Apple. GM wants to be the best at everything but I don't always see them committing significantly more resources to things they want to be the best at. There's also a lot of turnover/changing of staff on projects that are ""important"". Instead of work being done to move projects forward, most of the work is done to catch the new people up.

People do the same work without knowing about it until it's too late. 
Some management tries to play a cut-throat game. 
Managers promise to the business some new products behind the backs of their colleagues and then pushes the whole team to achieve those goals before anyone got the same idea and implemented it.

Higher management pushes for the following principles: ""speak up"", ""it's on me"", ""innovate"" and a lot of others. The actual team managers say that they very much agree with all of this to the business but behind their backs they say those principles are stupid and if you try to bring anything up to their attention you can get your bonus cut, your salary won't increase or they can even threaten you to be fired. All they care about is to deliver the requested set of features before the deadline. If it does not function properly during the release time they will start point fingers and blame other teams/certain team members/other managers. Anything just to prove their work is great and the reason we are going to miss the deadline is somewhere else.

","Poor management from the region on down. On my team, every one of them was a seasoned sales person. The middle management couldn't sell water to someone lost in the desert. Often, they did more harm than good when they visited. The layoffs were interesting because GM lost a lot of new talent and retained a lot of dead weight. The management was only shuffled and those that were part of GM bankruptcy were still retained. Kind of like hoping your poker hand changes just by switching the cards around. Since the decisions were in the hands of the middle and region management, management suffered no loss and they cut elsewhere. And yes, even if you were a high performer with degrees and dealership management experience, if your manager did not like you, you're out.

Tue Jul 30 2019, Software Developer,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,GM - A Career Role Of The Dice,10,"Easy interview
Open dress code
Work life balance*
Good culture*
Flexible PTO*

* - Depends on team.
","Basically, working at General Motors as a Software Developer as a new college hire is a total roll of the dice. Before you start, you need to be assertive about what you want to be doing. When I started, the company attempted to put me into a position that would have been less than ideal for my career, and didn't align with what I thought and was told I would be working on in general. I wanted to be a full stack developer, they attempted to put me on a mainframe management project. This would have been career suicide. I was told ""sometimes at GM, we just get what we get"". I had to start a political campaign to get myself out of this situation.

Some teams allow abuse and unrealistic project deadlines to propagate down from the business. I have seen devs overwork themselves, pushing in code at 2AM and working 12 hour days. Some managers are ok with this and expect this, and celebrate the ""rock stars"" who are slinging garbage into Bitbucket to just ""get it working"". Meanwhile, code reviews aren't really a thing, nor is unit testing or any code standards.

The staffing strategy is (and has been) literally this - replace the talent who leaves due to being underpaid by eager-to-please college hires. Lots of tribal knowledge, poor or total lack of standards, and toxic environments are cultivated as a by-product of this. 

My advice: if you want to be marketable and are coming into this job. Push to work with modern technologies and advocate for yourself and the type position you want. Don't let yourself get steamrolled. There's a lot of garbage in this organization and I have personally witnessed many suffer.

VMEC Milford

I've called into meetings to hear the experienced individuals making jokes about how I don't do anything. For a job that didn't have much to do in the first place I not only met all of my deadlines (other than imaginary ones which I apparently missed every one of) but repeatedly went above and beyond to improve the group. I guess that latter part doesn't matter when these things are either ignored, mocked, or argued against.

I don't know how these people go about there lives building their own narrative where it is okay to bully people based on their own trash talk and ignorance. As long as you laugh and smile you can get away with anything. This is how you achieve success at General Motors. The CEO says WIN but to win against those that are equal or better you must cheat. Resist change, talk trash...win. Resist ignorance forced by the experienced GM employees and push progress...lose. This is how they preserve the crony system. This is how the old hierarchies and behaviors that drove GM into bankruptcy and lawsuits persist. VMEC is pure poison. 

On another note, fewer people than you would expect actually get to drive the cars at Milford. I've seen several people disappointed by this.

Wed Jun 12 2019, Not Saying IT Because I Might Get Laid Off,"Warren, MI",Current Employee ,"Extremely Poor Management and lay-off culture , they laid off new hires too!!!!",6,"They pay you a high salary if you asked for it. Benefits and 401k are industry best. Cafeteria has some good food. If you want good money and the spouse is making enough money for you to survive a lay-off and if you like workplace POLITICS, this is the place for you. 
Vacation days and holidays are plenty
","- If you earn a higher salary you might get laid off ( I have seen it happen)
- if you are a new hire you might get laid off within a year ( I have seen it happen) 
- too many levels of upper management
- lower levels of management are not leaders, they are just people who want status updates. They do not care for career growth of the employee whatsoever. They are making some horrible people that everyone dislikes people managers. 
- they lay off half your group and expect you complete all those tasks and then tell you you are doing an ok job despite the workload.
- they expect you to work 12 hours a day if you want to grow ( despite not having 12 hours of work) 
- most of GM is fat, they hire too many people because management and resource management is super poor. 
- If you aren’t a politician don’t work for GM if you want to grow, hard work doesn’t matter, who you
Know matters. Know your directors since managers do not have any power really ( or they don’t care).
- processes are slow and ancient. 
- they said autonomous and active safety is the safest place to be, they had layoffs there too.
-no work from home options 
-level system is horrible. Nobody knows what they mean, since people with 5 years of experience might be the same level as someone with 15 years. So many high level people have nothing much to do, so many low level people have so much more to do than them. 
-they want you to be scared of upper management , not befriend them and have a good working atmosphere. 
- 100 good things done, and one mistake you make , you are on the lay-off list.
- some people will stab your back to look better than you. 
-Drive competitive products and learn what is wrong with your vehicles. Active safety features are standard in Toyota and Honda. 
- don’t be blind about competition , embrace it and learn about it, remove the stupid sign on the parking structure saying GM products only, it’s 2019.
- why did we choose bolt to be our electric Tesla competition?? That small car segment never sold, should have made an all electric Volt. 
- GM has the right to lay you off and destroy your family but people are treated like poorly if they wanted to leave voluntarily ( they walk you out). If people wanted to sell out sensitive information about GM, they would have done it already, you don’t need to walk people out, it’s not helping anything, it’s only hurting your reputation , and prevents employees from being honest to their managers.
Advice to Management
-Managers should Hire conservatively and intelligently. 
- listen to employees, don’t listen to back stabbing selfish employees. 
- ALL upper and lower MANAGEMENT SHOULD READ GLASSDOOR ( and all other websites) REVIEWS to see what is wrong and help the company.

Fri Jun 14 2019, Software Developer,"Chandler, AZ",Former Employee ,Unnecessary hardship due to seperation,3,"I was so excited when GM recruited me from my University. My family had bought GM vehicles all our lives and I was excited to work for them. There is no shortage of work, expect longer than average work days. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved with the Arizona Innovation Center and plenty of good people.
","Anyone is fair game for elimination at any time. We had a small team of programmers in Chandler and we were very busy - working non-stop 10 days a week. In February, we were individually escorted to a conference room where each of us were 'separated' from the firm. None of this made sense as we were doing good work and always busy. 

Also, it takes 3 years for your $401K to fully vest. As I was coming up on 3 years, the large amount of money that GM had contributed to my retirement was gone. Keep in mind that your $401K will be at risk of not vesting if you leave the company before years or your job is eliminated.
Advice to Management
Consider the families you are affecting when you eliminate people's jobs. I lost many classmates and friends all because the 'company' decided to eliminate jobs during a time of record profits. In my opinion, layoffs should only be considered as a last resort. 

Also, only lay off the people who truly deserve to go. Good, busy programmers do not deserve to be shown the door in such a demeaning way

","Traditional, Paternalistic, Confused, Top Down Leadership
Very difficult to grow professionally (incestuous focus on internal learning, no focus on benchmarking)
Micro-management pretty common here
Leadership pays lip service but does NOT listen to anything. Just learn to nod your head and say yes.
Layoffs/Restructuring (which is the the same as layoffs as they force you to move into a job in which you are neither qualified or interested in doing so that you choose to leave and they don't have to pay you severance)
Advice to Management
You need a critical mass to make effective, organizational change. GM is a huge ship and pretty impossible to change the direction of the culture. However, 1) get a CEO who has worked in other types of environments and not GM ALL of her life. 2) do a clean sweep of the level that reports to CEO and then, carefully, select only a few of the lower layers of mgt to stay. 3) Get RID of all the layers of management, 4) None of this matters cause GM will never listen and never learn.

Tue May 07 2019, Software Developer,"Chandler, AZ",Former Employee ,"Good place to start, hard to advance",2,"This was my first job out of college and for a first job, it was a good one. I got to learn a lot and work with some nice and talented people. The facility in Chandler is nice and new and close to plenty of food options near by. The benefits and yearly bonus are some of the best around.
","There were a bunch of unkept promises. They sell you on the fact that moving between teams is an easy option if you get bored or want to try something new. Not so easy. I worked at GM for over four years and spent over two trying to switch teams. The new college hire program could use work too. Many people just get placed on teams and into positions that don’t even align with what they learned in college. You end up with people in developer roles that aren’t developers, and developers that are placed in tester positions, etc.
Advice to Management
Place people in positions where their skillset aligns. Instead of just throwing bodies on teams, take more time up front to place them in positions where they can grow and contribute right away. Also if you say that you can easily switch around teams, make that apparent or don’t sell the idea that it is simple when really it is not. It is easy to get pigeonholed if you aren’t careful and looking out for yourself and your own career.

Learn to say NO! If it's a legacy application and we do not support it, say NO, we're not supporting it. Instead, they want us to to support it. Keep supporting it, application teams will never migrate to newer technology.
