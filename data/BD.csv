a lot of room to grow depends on which group and the connections of your manager like you!
If your manager or director likes you you can get stock options.
","The company is way to the silo'd. It is an old boys and girls club.
No room to grow, and no career development!
Promotion is done based on conflict of interests and benefits in return
Victims remain silent ( supports are fake!)
Transparency and visibility do not apply to managers and higher levels
Politics are toxic. unrealistic deadlines. zero work-life balance.

Bullying tactics against suppliers, Been told as a buyer I should feel ""privledged"" to get to buy for BD, constantly being fed how great a company that treats you badly is, cutting 401k completely, providing only 2% raise to ensure stock holders and the upper class employees are paid their millions, poor BD can't afford to take care of their people or pay their bills on time, beuracracy and cronyism a plenty, absolutely terrible medical benefits, anything good they had, they've cut(pension). The plant employees are treated like 2nd class citizens. Absolutey unethical company(a good company doesn't have to constantly tell you how good they are), with the new CEO their goals have changed to remove diversity as one of them, look at their board.

The management wants to build a team of yes man or woman to protect their own hide. They are not respectful to the hourly people that do the actual work and have the skill set. They are treated like children and with disdain. No HR on site and HR is work from home with no factory or experience in workplace for the state of Missouri. Willing ignores phone calls and shop floor information. High turnover for hourly with no training program to replace senior people retiring. Setting the shop up for failure. The current management set scapegoats to fire to look like they are actual fixing and taking charge but nothing changes for failure to look at system faults because they developed systems. Current salary personnel are in constant fear and CYA mode most days. Management does not train supervisor on systems so they can micro manage keep off balance and constant need to always be right.

Wed Jan 01 2020, Customer Service Representative III,"San Antonio, TX",Current Employee ,Great Experience with BD,2,"I was contracted (temporary) and was offered a permanent position after a year (some temps got offers before and after, just depended on the employees and managers). A class of about 30 of us were trained in customer service for a little over a month. We were hired as Customer Service Representatives. Some of us were offered positions on the phones (they received a little more training due to the nature of their positions) and others were offered a position working the claims (email communication with customers and little phone contact). I heard positive things from the reps who worked on the phones. BD's customers are mostly distributors (of BD products) and medical professional's offices. I work on the claims team. The claims range from discrepancies in customers' orders, shipments, billing, and prices. Ongoing training / refreshing is necessary, so you're always learning something new, but the basic job function is routine. Overall culture at BD is positive and management encourages employees to bring fresh ideas and feedback. Like any company, some people can be difficult to get along with, but it's nice that most co-workers make a positive difference. BD offers a full benefits package for their permanent employees, pay raises, monetary bonuses once a year (in our department), and recently has made arrangements to allow some employees to work from home. Other nice perks at the San Antonio, Texas office; secure building access, vending machines, free coffee, hot cocoa, water, and ice, T.V. in lounge and lunch rooms, employee appreciation events (with fun little games, prizes, and giveaways). BD does a good job at maintaining a positive atmosphere for employees. I have enjoyed working here and am happy that there are opportunities to grow and learn new things, because expanding your skills is fun and helpful.
","Working at BD has been a great experience for me. The only real con I find is with the way our country hasn't kept up with decent living wages for the lower level earners. Yes what I got offered at BD has supported me so far, but it would be nice to be able to afford more as a single person, meaning, I would like to be able to afford my education expenses when I decide to go back to school, decent housing, life expenses for additions to my family, and savings.

It was a good job for me cause I go a little stir crazy sitting at my desk all the time. I was quickly given opportunities based on how I performed and my eagerness.
","I was continually asked to do more and more, work more and more hours and was compensated less and less. I worked on a project that had some difficulties for a while integrating some vendor technology, I started pulling 14-16 hour days trying to get things fixed and running. After about a month of that I told my boss that I was only going to work 12 hours a day so that I could go home and see my family. He was fine with it, so I worked from 6 - 6 for a while, but on several occasions I was stopped by the plant manager on my way out and chewed out for ""leaving early"". There also was no opportunity for growth. You basically had to wait around for people to move or change positions, even though this is a global company with lots of opportunities.

Pros
Other consultants are nice, Paid mileage to the airport. however, NO monthly car allowance , NO gas. its all on you.
Cons
Upper management are no where to be found. You are just a pawn in their game. You work your butt off, travel every week. They will tell you that you have a territory but it turns out it will be the entire USA. That's right your territory is all USA. You will be sick of seeing the suitcase. excessive meetings about meetings. Consultants do half the project managers work ??? You will be at the site 2 weeks in a row. 1 week education and the other week of go live. PM shows up in the beginning and leaves when its convenient for them. When your done teaching for the day and you go back to your hotel. Well its not time to rest, its time to open the computer and start doing a couple hrs of work each night for future accounts- again doing alot of the PM's work. Not sure how upper management thinks this is normal. I guess out of site out of mind??? way to ignore issues. If you happen to sell additional modules because you are also sales support, you dont get a dime!! but who does , the sales person that's not even on site. Absolutely no incentive!! Dont even think about climbing the ladder, it wont happen. I have been here for a while and I only seen a couple people in the system move to Senior consultant and thats after they have you doing a TON of FREE extra work well above the 50 hrs of work/week you do. Excessive emails t/o the day and a lot of the emails are about how upper management advancing. DONT send me any more emails about LGBTQ - just ridiculous it shouldn't be a part of work emails. This is supposed to be a large and professional company. Lets keep your sexuality preference out of it!!! If you have a family , think long and hard!!! you WILL NOT SEE THEM. 5-6 days of travel every week. They will tell you less but NOT being truthful. They pull you in then your stuck. My kids are grown however I dont get to see my spouse that often. Currently looking for a new position to prevent a divorce.

","The 250 building is ridden with corruption and employees in upper management who are incompetent and exhibit bullying behavior towards others. This building is often referred to as the ""trailer trash"" of BD and that couldn't be more than correct. The Supervisor for Liquid Media was let go under shady circumstances. They lose great people because those in management have do not know how to lead. The Quality for the Liquid Media plant at 250 left because her boss was/is a bully. (I have witnessed her bosses behavior and it is disgusting--no class) incessantly attempted to bully and undermine her. The person in question did excellent work for the company and was even in the corporate mentorship program. She did great work, and even management has posted her job at a higher rank than she initially held while at BD, currently posted as a QE II. Thankfully, she got a better job in MD within a leadership role and is making A LOT more money!

I have left as well. If you are a young person this is NOT a building you would want to work in. PERIOD.

I’m guessing that shaking out Bard’s old work office ethics and “way of doing things” will greatly help, since BD itself seems to have much better values/company expectations.

I have been working at BD part-time
Pros
not sure about the pros yet.
Cons
The San Diego based Alaris training program for per diem Clinical Consultants was an awful experience. It did not resemble corporate training, but rather a flash-back to a freshman nursing class with a mean instructor whose goal was to have at least 2 students cry and drop-out before the semester was over. The instructor was punitive and aggressive. I have never been treated so unprofessionally before in any setting. 

I heard that the goal for per diem medical device educators, is that the attendees who do not move on to be active educators (for whatever reason) at least leave the training as “brand ambassadors”… meaning, experts on the device who had a great experience with the company. That was not the case in our training, we all left with a horrible impression of the company, feeling defeated and mentally exhausted.
Advice to Management
Advice: treat the medical professionals who attend your trainings with professional courtesy; they are an accomplished group of nursing professionals with bachelors and masters degrees. Don’t talk about how the full-time CC’s are “going to eat you alive”. Have realistic expectations of how much the average adult learner can absorb in one day. After throwing a tantrum, don’t ask who is ready to quit; this is not a reality show competition where you see how far you can push someone until they cry. Don’t punish attendees by yelling at them and making the entire class re-do presentations when one is not up to your standards. Don’t raise your voice at your attendees. Don’t require the entire class to physically follow along during each and every single practice presentation, pressing buttons, over and over and over, it caused unnecessary alarm fatigue and sore fingers.

","Many of us were hired under false pretenses. We were told the position would be temp-to-hire, but after starting (and some turned down other positions) it came out that this was absolutely temporary with no option for permanent hire. We were not informed of this until a conversation about academics came up, and although we were brought on with associates degrees, we were told only those with bachelors could be permanent employees. 
Contractors aren't privileged to participate in ANYthing. Discount tickets are constantly advertised, but contractors aren't allowed to purchase. Free BBQ was brought in for employee appreciation week, contractors were turned away. 
They stuck 25 of us in a room, on tables (not desks or cubicles), with electrical cords hanging from the ceiling. 
The only time we saw our direct manager was when he was yelling at us to produce more. He would send the team lead to do some of his dirty work such as telling us something else had changed (at least once per day, sometimes as many as 4 times per day). When the manager was approached to ask about progress, and if we were meeting the daily and weekly goals to achieve the overall goal, we were told ""things are fine, just keep working"". 
Many refused to even give notice, because they would be shamed (""we're losing another one, more work for everyone else"") or other unprofessional embarrassments.
I was given a badge to get in my ONLY the front door. Then I was ticketed for parking in the front parking lot. When I went to security to inquire, it was removed from my employee record (yes, really), and I was THEN given a parking sticker for my vehicle.

Definitely a weight off the shoulders knowing all of the maintenance, gasoline and insurance is paid for. Pension was offered, one of the very, very few companies that offer one.
","Did not feel welcome. The first week in San Jose for new hire orientation was a nightmare. Running around campus looking for cell phones, looking for IT people to configure my laptop, looking for HR people to take my taxes out right. Everyone has a job and it seemed like every time I needed someone they were impossible to get a hold of. Management is totally clueless. I worked at BD for 3.5 months, and talked to my manager exactly 2 times. He had no idea how anything was going, and when I called him to tell him I was resigning he was shocked. The technical leadership is awful. My team lead berated me in front of customers, hardly answered any questions, and cursed at me often. Training was impossible. They stuffed a 3-4 week training class into 2 weeks, often going 11-12 hours a day, and the trainees shared instruments that were just totally junk. 
 So class was shortened and hands on time was halved. Oh yes, and there was an 8 hour practical at the end! If you fail, you're fired! This do or die test was not disclosed during the interview, and when I called HR and asked about it the class facilitator lied and said that was not true. Lastly, there are hardly any SOPs. Everyone does everything a different way; so when one person tells you to do something one way and another person watches you do it the way you learned, that second person tells you that's wrong and shows you their way. When you ask for the manual reference to determine what is called for, there is nothing there.
Advice to Management
Hire actual managers. The manager that I dealt with was just plain bad. Foster a culture of open and honest communication, and don't allow the technical people chosen to be team leads to become unapproachable. Spend a little bit of money to get people trained, and have an actual training plan with timeline. Lastly, be honest during the interview and actually find people to interview candidates that know how to assess talent. Throwing a bunch of diagrams in someone's face and grilling them about certain aspects of them is okay, I guess, but not finding out anything about someone's character is not an effective way to gather enough information from a candidate to decide if they'll work out or not. Working at BD Biosciences as an FSE was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.

","The team that i worked for was terrible, management really unorganized. We never received any training prior answering phone calls and we were only getting criticized all the time for all the negative feedback we received. I think that the supervisor i had lack of leadership skills, criteria and peoples skill. As a corporate i feel they dont make good decision to keep their employees satisfied.

My last thought is that progressing is really slow, first i start it as a contingent worker for a couple of months i got converted quick but in order to move to other departments i need it to be at least one year in the position and have a good perfomance. The supervisor did not seem to favor me so i need it to wait until September of 2018 to get another rating and hope for the best. Which means i would had work almost two years in the same position with only 32 cents increase.
