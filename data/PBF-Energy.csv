","This place is Childish and unorganized. They never give you any proper training, they just throw you in and u sink or swim. You literally have to teach yourself everything. And if you sink they will get rid of you, only based on the opinion of your coworkers, not because management ever took the time to see how u were adjusting. Everyone is TOO busy to stop and help and work never gets completed. Workers are immature, and lots of drama gets escalated from coworkers not maintaining a professional standard. Also management and HR fault. It's basically like a giant adult prison, just waiting 8 hours to get out of hell. You will get used and abused until they can hire someone younger and cheaper. You've been warned. Don't work here!

Tue Jun 28 2016,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Not what it once was but still has potential,3,"Pay, bonus, benefits, 401k, and pension are all top of the line. It is a young company with potential, so it is growing fast. Because its a relatively small company, there's very little red tape and implementing a project that makes sense is not very difficult. This is perfect for creative minds and it provides a great deal of job satisfaction because you really can see the fruits of your own labor. There's never a day that is boring or not busy. There are many creative, bright individuals here with excellent ideas.
","Advancement is not based on performance, instead on how buddy buddy you are with the right management people. The majority of management knows little to nothing about actually managing people, so the refinery is very misguided and many try to lead by intimidation and have little to no trust in the bottom level staff (without reason). The young workers are abused and overworked and underpaid compared to those with a little more experience. It wouldn't be difficult to find a comparable job that pays about 80-90% of what you make here but has 50% or less of the workload. If you have any oil giant on your resume from the past, you're treated as a deity regardless of actual skill, intelligence, experience, or performance. You are often asked to do redundant work over and over again because of the lack of trust and communication. Lots of the base level work is done for the sake of being busy and does not provide any actual value. The company is understaffed across the board, and the workload just continually gets increased. Work-life balance is below average on the best days and turnarounds are just ridiculously awful.
Advice to Management
Listen to and trust your base level workers (salary and hourly). Hire more engineers and operators. Before adding workload to your staff, consider the value behind that work and if it's truly worth the time to an already understaffed organization. Pay overtime to salary employees for turnarounds or establish fixed compensation time rules. In the beginning, this was a great company to work for, anymore, I'm not sure if it's really worth being a part of but it can be like it used to if the management turns their act around. It looks like things will be getting better in the near future but who knows.

","In a fast-paced environment it is very easy to lose sight of what makes things work - the employees. With very few exceptions, there is no focus on development of talent internally and that is evident by the rising number of departures of original members of the company. There is also an enabling culture at PBF that allows sub-par performers to not only keep their jobs but get rewarded - WOW! There is definitely a focus of management making sure that they pay themselves and that raises are kept minimal for most of the work force on annual basis. Worked several years with no increase in salary or acknowledgement of the effort.

","They like to operate very lean here, so you are always asked to do things outside your job role and are constantly over-worked. Management is very blind to the daily operations work that exist. Very poor in compensation, they will give you ""promotions"" without a raise in salary or benefits; essentially its just more roles without increased pay. Bonuses are not guaranteed and for the past two years they have issued less than 1% in bonus. You are also capped at a 3% yearly max salary raise. Although the experience around you is good, you are never able to truly learn from it because everyone has so much on their plate they have no time to teach or have their brain picked. You move up in this company based on whether or not your relationship with management is good, not based on your quality of work. It's an ""every man for themselves"" environment. Even managers will sell you out for doing something they forced you to do if they have too. Work-life balance is terrible; the company never does anything for employees, not even a free lunch. Communication is also very poor. People aren't clear as to who does what or as to what the direction of certain projects are. It causes confusion and friction when relying on teams/individuals for quality information
Advice to Management
The managers understand the big picture but are somewhat clueless as to what it takes to run the company on a day to day. You need more resources and people to assist. Communication is very poor, you need to be more clear with the internal directions and roles of people.
Offer more growth and education to the youth. Their are a lot of hungry hardworking individuals who want to excel, let them and cut the managers who hold them down because they like to coast at their position.

-There is no reimbursement for graduate education, but they do pay for professional training (PMP, PE, etc.).
