Sun Feb 07 2021, Field Engineer II,"Broussard, LA",Current Employee ,"Good company, disconnect between local and HQ management",0,"The local management is fantastic, they're very flexible but are very knowledgeable and supportive. Despite it being the oilfield, they try to make reasonable, achievable goals for everyone.
","Honestly, sometimes big companies make decisions that make sense to managers that are very removed from the people and customers of a business unit, but it might be nice to see more deference given to local management when times get tough. Don't forget, oilfield hours, so 24/7/365.25, if you aren't prepared for that, it might be best to look at a different industry.
Advice to Management
Local management: stay the course and endure. We know you all have bills to pay just like we do.
HQ management: don't forget the little people, they aren't just numbers. And listen to the local management team. Also, don't take away the few perks the job has (such as vehicle allowance). It makes the entire team embittered to get worked harder for less money. I know that historically it has been relatively easy to recruit talent because the oilfield pays better, but no one likes getting mistreated. The 'your pay can be changed at anytime' is one of those problems that will haunt the entire oilfield in the near future. Anyway, if the shoe were on the other foot regarding things like vehicle allowance, you'd probably have a lot to say about it. Also, perhaps it might be helpful that when HQ management announces core values, it might be good to solicit and utilize ""commoner employee"" feedback about how to actually apply those core values when times get tough. As what was once told to me, it's very easy to run an oil company at $100/BBL, but the crap hits the fan when oil hits $20/BBL. That's when you'll really see those core values in action, or otherwise.

Thus, abandoning your service roots and your customers. Next, they pivot to be a ""friendly"" clean energy company, yet never really articulating your vision to the people that pay your bills. WTF are you doing?? MANAGEMENT YOU DONT CREATE A DIME OF REVENUE, SO STOP TREATING YOUR EMPLOYEES LIKE THEY ARE DISPOSABLE. Executives care more about social agendas than the people who really make up the workforce. Yet, I am sure none of them took compensation reductions all while cutting jobs and sending many families into financial chaos. I was lucky enough to get out before it hit the fan!!

","Too many layoffs - During the downturns, Baker's first chose is layoff, not furlough or any other options, while the competitors such as Schlumberger implemented both options available to save their people and company from the beginning of downturn. For 2015 oil downturn, they cut about 50% of workforce over the course of 1.5years. During the covid downturn, they cut about 20% or more in the first half of 2020. They seem to continue downsizing and the stock price has been going down ever since the merger with GE oil and gas. 

Politics - I have seen promoting completely incompetent people to management role solely due to politics. As the result, The subordinates and team productivity suffered from their incompetency, and the qualified candidates for the role left the company - so fed up with politics. I have seen similar situation repeating three times during my six years of service. My coworkers with longevity with the company seemed to be accustom to it.

Consider seniority, qualifications, and performance when doing layoffs. Don't just lay everyone off because they work in a certain region.

Wed Sep 09 2020, Commercial Manager,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,"Lots of ""winging it"" in a typical corporate environment suitable for ""cogs",2,"-Compensation can be great if you twist arms to get what you deserve.

-Annual bonuses were consistent but complicated calculations and missed metrics always worked the amount down substantially.

-Some genuinely nice coworkers and a couple unicorn managers who were natural leaders.

-If you jump through enough arbitrary hoops to obtain hi-pot (high potential) status you get paid better, an office, and higher positions than those who contribute the same or more than you do.

-They recently implemented very generous paternity and maternity leave. Many eligible people were afraid to take the full length of their leave however.

-Can be stable if you keep your head down out of HR's cross-hairs. Not because the company reciprocates any degree of loyalty that they expect from their employees.
","-Constant lay-offs to keep you reminded that you're totally disposable and at any moment you'll end up on the curb. But until then.... GO TEAM!

-The failed Halliburton merger followed by the GE acquisition which quickly turned into the GE sell-off created YEARS of uncertainty and turmoil for employees. Then COVID and an oil downturn hit. I never felt comfortable looking too far forward and rightfully so.

-In all 8 years, between 3 different company entities, and under a dozen different managers, I never had 1 performance review that wasn't a total joke. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, took them seriously. As a result morale was basically in the gutter because they are ultimately used to control raises and career progression. 

-Never-ending manager shuffling and re-organizing. Extremely frustrating to prove yourself over and over again while receiving conflicting directives and priorities (or lack thereof).

-Dead-end job corporate job structure with a lacking reward system. Job titles were pulled out of thin-air and sometimes revoked depending on the quarterly hierarchy changes. 

-Stunning lack of instruction for how a manager should behave and LEAD their team. Almost no universal communication for expectations of work schedules, etc.

-There's an overwhelming feeling that the company is barely keeping it's head above water and you can imagine how far down on the priority list that puts employees.
Advice to Management
Devise a real GENUINE plan to help your employees grow and hire REAL LEADERS that care about developing their team. There's way too much smoke-blowing going on. Lots of cutesy marketing cartoons, buzzword-y catch phrases and motto's that do nothing to boost morale and it comes off as very ""out of touch"". 

Stop telling employees to stay focused on work during mass layoffs, re-orgs, poor market conditions, and bad publicity about the company. 

People work for people, not for companies.

","The company itself is great. My experience with the Research and Development group in Drilling and Completion (DCF) was not at all how BKR is trying to create and grow the company. DCF RDD had a very silo atmosphere. The managers did not get along (there were three of them) and information was getting across employees differently. They did not care to hear new ideas from employees. If you are male, PLEASE apply for any job at BKR other than this group. Males are for lifting things and getting lower end projects. They highly discriminate minority males in this group. HR did nothing. Many males got lower bonuses than the females. Male or female, you will not advance in this group. There are no support from management or clear guidelines. They have had many HSE issues so to me, HSE is not their priority, which is not what the company stands for. You will be neglected and when a project fails, it will be sorely your fault. Again, BKR is a great company so apply in other departments.

From the Artificial Lift viewpoint, you can gain some very transferable experience/knowledge, but with a twist of old school methods. Many opportunities for internal networking, especially helpful when you're interested in moving around the company.
","Communication could be better, all around.
Product Centers and Regional locations are often considered ""silos"" and communication between these areas could be greatly improved, helping to eliminate the ""us versus them"" thinking. It often seems there is a ""do this, because.. by yesterday.."" mentality that leaves individuals/teams blindsided. This can lead to projects being labeled urgent, but with no real understanding of why, except for those in higher-up positions. There are many instances you'll find that they're behind the times with available software/tools. It may be common in other companies, but you'll see lots of moving around from the upper-most management. This can help with company growth by spreading out knowledge, but every once in a while it's nice to have someone in a position that knows it well and is reliable. It is the oil & gas sector, very much a boom-or-bust industry, so make good decisions and always be prepared for the chance of layoffs.

","Since I started for some odd reason the the office coordinates appear to dislike me. I wasn't part of the club. I got hired normally base on skills I guess. Even the front desk woman was shock when I told her I got hire normally like a normal person no friends or getting on my knees. 

Baker Hughes PA has a little click. You either a friend of their little groups or you came from the same university. If you come from West Virginia University then you'll have an easier time moving up because most of the clowns in the office came from that university. If you want to laugh they label as the WV mafia pretty funny huh ? 

The next thing you need to know is this, if you have no life and just came out of school and don't respect yourself then you'll be the right guy or woman for the job. They don't respect time off unless you challenge them. They try to strong arm you a lot, the employees are scared to speak up because in PA they have laws that they can fire you for whatever reason. Also because most assume they're ""friends"" with the office people. You'll work none stop unless either something serious happens in your personal life or if you're their friend. A lot of their spineless employees will cry how they haven't been home and give these ridiculous reason why they don't want to go home.

They will jump over hoops for their friends but if you're not in the group then you're dead in the water. Expect nothing , they also had pay cuts don't be fooled by what they told you, they're goal right now is to save money and they're just targeting FE and FS because they have this idea that the field hands are the problem for the cost issues. Instead of looking within their little office and start saving money from within. 

Some times there is no support and you'll have to manage things your self. You'll work sometimes with co-workers who are great who understand the job and there are times you'll work with some guys who are just worthless. You'll end up doing everything yourself and believe me they will get the credit and you won't instead you'll look like the bad guy, these guys will call the office and tell them made up garbage just to sound good. I bet you're asking what do they get from this ? They get nothing all they're told is ""good job man...."" that's it. A lot of these big egos normally cost the job as well. Even the clients have complains of the coordinators for lying and other things. How are you suppose to cover for their lies? but I'm the bad guy ? 

Promotions and fast tracking goes to their friends first, then the rest if they have room (money funds). Lots of cry babies that will use false issues to excel. 

If you're a smart person who is following the oil and gas industry then look some where else. Other districts are better then the PA one. I'm shock that no one has wrote about this ? A lot of the reviews also appear to be fake on here so let see how fast this one gets black holed . 

The worse thing about it is if you do want to be an awesome employee and you want to excel within the company then it's not going to happen. You can design or built something and it will be shot down because someone got jealous or cried about it or some weird mess. Again like I said I don't requirement this company it was bad when I got in and it just got worse over time. I'm glad I done .

My assumption is the VPs are under a lot of pressure because of their boss. Right now the culture is extremely stressful. Apparently Baker Hughes is a great place to work, however I do not see it. It is completely dependent on who you n1 and n2 manager are. Do a lot of careful research before you take a job.

Out of touch leadership at the company (GE). I recall one time where we had a team dinner with the Chief HR Officer of GE where we spent thousands of dollars, yet the next day I had to close down a facility and lay off over 20 people. 

I was laid off due to politics as the HR Executive within my group felt that she needed to bring her own people.

- Not a lot of social life and few good job alternatives in the area. Reno is not yet a technology center beyond manufacturing and data centers.

Advice to Management
1. Replace the old-timers in the upper management with external hires, the company needs people who can make (and not be afraid of) executive decisions vs making nice presentations to keep their jobs. 2. The company is overstaffed, therefore the bonus is non-existent (max 2-3% a year), the people are trying to justify their existence by performing a non-value add work, tough decisions need to be made.

The coworkers are largely easy to get along with and are professional. The pay and benefits packages are competitive for the industry.
","Management decisions are heavily weighted towards the next quarter and employ short sighted financial engineering practices that harms long term performance of the company. There is little communication between middle and upper managers and directives from one group can clash with rules and procedures of another group. The company does not respect older employees and will think nothing of laying off a 30 year service employee and replacing them with an inexperienced 2 year service employee. The company does not respect its suppliers and will distribute IP from one supplier to another to try and create competition and drive down procurement costs. Also they try to push asinine 120 day payment terms onto suppliers who expect to be paid in 30 days.

Think in one and five year terms instead of the next quarterly report. Treat all stakeholders (employees, suppliers, customers) with respect. Aka Conscious Capitalism. Communicate your plans explicitly across all groups so they’re marching in the same direction. Fast works won’t work when it takes a month to just get a vendor setup to receive a PO.

","Leaders hold a preoccupation with looking out for No. 1; there’s like a clampdown on consensus-building conversations sometimes accompanied by the shunning or ousting of anyone so bold or naive as to tell the truth about what he believes.

Only the unhappy employees care about the downward slide. The higher-ups don't... because they got a plan. Leaders don't care about layoffs, turnover and/or resignations for the simple reason that turnover and talent loss only hurts an organization that is trying to build something to last. And This business isn’t actually trying to last. The New Braunfels site will either be te-purposes or shutdown. They only need employees to get them to the finish line. And that finish line probably has to do with USLNG and maybe engineering work on a couple other projects. That's all. That might be an unethical way to operate but at least they have a finish line.

Tue Oct 13 2020, Software Engineering Specialist,Pune,Current Employee ,1.3 Yrs @ Baker Hughes - Pune - Former GE Oil & Gas,6,"1. Salary is huge as per industry standard.
2. Not very sure about hike as i didin't receive it as was only into 6 months during the increment cycle.
3.Nice technologies to work with and brilliant people.

This is my second update. Have given the first one after 6 months of joining as well.
","1. Work pressure in BH Pune is huge. I have been working for 10+ hrs almost everyday since Feb 2020. With incoming covid and WFH it has crossed 14+ hrs for 1-2 days weekly as well. (And no comp-offs or overhead salary for extra hours spent.)

2. Agile methodology is followed while giving updates. So updates are crisp, and everyone gets to know which work is done/pending. However, due to dependency on other teams for few works, tasks gets stuck on out name for more days. Hence causing problems which FMs/TPMs don't try to understand even on explaining.

3. Most of the people in here are quite experienced with 10+ years of experience. As such most of them are having a galla time with WFH, avoiding work and putting pressure of lesser experienced folks while enjoying time with family.

4. FMs have no idea whatsoever about who is working on what/how. As such performance measurement is given by other people on your team. As such blame game is quite common otherwise they wont have a decent enough review. TLs are TLs in name only. (at least the one i have been working with). Never seen doing something with the leadership skills allotted for leading. It really hurts when you dont get a decent review even after working 10-14+ hrs for over 9 months continuously.
Advice to Management
1. FMs needs to know how/when someone is performing. Our reviews shouldnt be dependent on other people's reviewes about us. This creates a rift within the same team we are working with.

2. Acknowledgement and appreciation is required for hard work. Didint see that anywhere. Also, just a blank appreciation mail won't do. We are working as an employee for the base pay. An monetary/other form of compensation should follow through.

3. WFH doesn't mean that we should be working 14+ hrs. Your TPMs don't get that. They need only updates. I have been getting calls at 10P.M. to do stuff and asking about updates on it the next day at 11 A.M. This is impossible to do. We aren't GODs.

4.If you want to retain fresh employees and not just the legacy GE Oil & Gas employees better take heed of whats happening within the organization as i have seen quite a few of brightest minds leave the organization and i too am planning to do so within a year in case I don't notice any change within the organization.
The GE tag name makes it quite easy to switch jobs in software/core industries. 

5.Why 3 yr is required for any promotion? There shouldn't be any such thing. I dont see a very bright career ahead with all the above, Moreover Oil & Gas industry is quite cynical and everyone is frightened with what happened in kochi. Better take control of you might lose a huge chunk of your workforce as soon as covid ends. BH has a pretty bad reputation now in the job market after sacking 25% workforce from kochi. So would be pretty tough to get newer employees.

","The tight schedule of work. What is mentioned in the contract is not what's on the ground. Baker Hughes's style of management is doing the same amount of work with fewer and fewer people over time (without fair compensation).

The managers at any given time were given the authority of having a blind eye over them to keep the revenue up as much as possible even if it was to cut from the employees if the revenue was less. Actions against complaints were always blocked or done late (if ever made, or only if reached a higher level). 

During the oil price crisis in 2016; the company failed to keep a good eye on
(1) the quality of the services given to the clients. 
(2) product line managers, and branch managers (resulting in many intended deceptions and corruption; such as dealing with non-standard tools and vendors or non-standard workflow, and even not complying or caring about basic safety measures in order to keep the job running. Also to cut payments from employees directly by managers).
(3) the quality of employees and their advancement (no courses, no training, no promotions, and no salary increments).
