Very generous life insurance plans

For the most part all team members do their best to support each other, at least at the corporate office

Paid holidays and vacation and sick time
","Health insurance deductibles and out of pocket maximums are ridiculously high

The executive leadership utilizes a very ""top down"" approach to decision making. Rarely are lower level team members consulted on major operational changes. If they are consulted, recommendations or suggestions are usually ignored

Managers are often overloaded with responsibilities. This causes the manager's relationship with their direct reports to suffer because the manager may not have time to fully devote to the issues their direct reports are facing because they are being overloaded with responsibilities for a completely different area

There is also a worrying trend of positions being eliminated and responsibilities being added to the remaining employees with little to no extra pay as part of a ""lean"" model business strategy
Advice to Management
When it comes to benefits, it seems Tyson takes a quantity over quality approach. Yes, all the specialized accident and disability plans are nice, but any benefit from those plans is negated when you have to pay an $1,100 deductible and $5,000 out of pocket maximum on your health insurance plan. Focus on bringing down the cost of the health insurance instead of wasting so much effort pushing those superfluous disability and accident plans. 

Do not overload your managers with responsibilities for conflicting areas. Allow managers to focus their attention on one area. Along those same lines, in the era of COVID, a lean business strategy will just no longer support necessary operations. You must invest in creating new positions instead of just trying to hoist additional work and responsibilities on fewer team members.

","The most common characteristics of the culture are are intolerant and judgmental.

This is an insular culture, not just silo'd, and they're proud of it. The flow of new ideas from outside the org, when allowed in, enters via silo's and is rendered into echo chambers. Once an idea gets legs, it is regurgitated over and over. ex., three attempts at deploying a new core ERP platform over 12 years. The result is the refrain from The Talking Heads - Once in a lifetime, the title of this review.

When a new idea finds its legs you will see it written up in any trade or industry mag they can get to publish it. Over and Over again.

Politics not only rule the day, they cascade thru every aspect of the organization. Where most large companies can contain this to the upper levels of more nakedly ambitious ladder climbers, here, it permeates the company.
Advice to Management
Figure out how to infuse tolerance into the silo's.

Recognize the impact on brands when the new CEO begins to realize the vision of fully automated everything. Plants, processes, electric self driving trucks, etc. 

Try to embed kindness vs caring, teamwork vs collaboration. Get to some more concrete objectives that require the lifers to rethink how and why of day to day. Right now its just lip service and cronyism.

While hopping around may get you there, at some point, if your resume is peppered with tons of different jobs, your agenda will look transparent to your next potential employer. Decide what you feel you’re worth and, once you’re satisfied with your salary level, try to stay in one place for a while.
","Most companies prefer to promote from within rather than go outside to fill positions. There are many benefits to identifying, grooming and keeping talent at a company and, according to a study done this year by Wharton management professor Matthew Bidwell, ""external hires"" get significantly lower performance evaluations for their first two years on the job than do internal workers who are promoted into similar jobs. The trick is to make your desire to move up known to your superiors so that when a more senior position becomes available, they think of you before looking elsewhere.

Fri Mar 20 2020, Business Intelligence Manager,"Springdale, AR",Former Employee ,Terminated Without Cause,7,"The salary was somewhat competitive.
","Throughout my time at Tyson Foods I received excellent feedback from leadership and everyone I worked with. After months of making great accomplishments and progress, meeting deadlines, etc. my manager began to acting negatively toward me, communicating less with me as my time ended abruptly. One day, out of nowhere, I was invited to a meeting titled, ""Action Plan,"" and it only included me, my manager and a team member from HR. At the time, I didn't think anything of it, until the meeting began. My manager began speaking allowed and stating that I was being put under a 30 day Action Plan due to ""lack of collaboration."" My reaction was a huge surprise, because up until that point, I was told I was doing everything great! My manager then assigned me to create a Brainshark video over the 5C's (which I completed) and told to put together a proposal for leadership (which I spent days working on and gathering information and also completed). After receiving positive feedback from my manager about how great I was doing, I had not heard anything else. 

Fast forward, Tyson lays 500 employees off, thankfully I was unaffected, or so I thought. Then the COVID-19 pandemic sends the entire company working remote. One day, at random, I get a Zoom meeting invite from my manager and HR. As I feel fully confident going into this meeting that everything was going great and we were going to drop the Action Plan. My manager begins by stating that this will be my last day with Tyson and I am being terminated, I am in total disbelief (so is every single person I work with). I tried asking my manager why this was happening or what the reason was, he immediately LEFT the call without saying anything (real 5C material if you ask me). I tried asking HR the same question and why my manager left the call. She said, “well, we decided that we were going to go with performance issues as the reason,” without any details or reasoning. 

Short story, my manager took my proposal, never even looked or commented on my Brainshark video (which I now realize was just busy work), fired me for no real reason and didn’t even have the courage to stay on the call.
I would consider taking the position back if I didn’t have to work for the same manager. Especially considering we are in the middle of a pandemic, my entire family is sick and my insurance was cut off on the day of my termination. My manager knew I had a family, he knew many of my family members were sick. The chances of securing a job during this time are little to none.
Advice to Management
Treat your employees with candor and care (and actually follow through).

Investigate whether these situations are actually true or false! I was a valued employee and loved the work I was able to do during my time there, only getting excellent feedback. I even stated to a team member that I could see myself retiring at Tyson. 

I truly hope the sincerity of my message is heard.

They loose employees a lot because most people in their packaging department is on meth and either flips out or messes up horrible over and over again.
In some departments you get set hours and some you dont.
They will run you til 6am from you coming in any where from 10am to 2pm without warning just so they dont have to pay you to come in on a sunday and get double time.
They tend to be cold hearted i have a couple friends and just co workers here that have been denied paid time off when their wife was seriously heart, child seriously hurt, been hospitalized for things they dont feel is important to them, and even denied someone grievance pay when their grandma died even though they do everyone else of course that issue was corrected when taken above their heads.
They have refused semi drivers directions. Promised them an unload or load at a certain time then say that they cant cause that part is closed down even after telling the, while they were on their way they would.

There are some easy job tasks if you are given the opportunity.
","My job is physically demanding, stressful, dirty, and leaves my body in a continual state of pain and weakness compared to regular health. Nobody cares much about physical injuries or discomforts you are forced to experience. It is the most difficult, gross and painful job I have ever experienced. Men are required to do all of the hardest and most unpleasant tasks, while women get free passes on all but the easiest tasks.
Advice to Management
Evaluate jobs better to provide more appropriate pay per task. Some jobs are considerably harder or more unpleasant than others, yet the pay is either identical or barely different.

Provide workers with a source of more protective gear that reduces the pain and discomfort of certain tasks.

Management and supervisors seem to make judgements about the difficulty of a job without having enough personal experience actually doing the job.

Chiller rehangers are freezing to near the point of hypothermia, and experiencing nerve damage working for 8+ hrs handling freezing and wet chickens. I have seen supervisors help do this job for maybe 30 minutes, and I know from experience it does not become unpleasant or painful until after about 3 hours... which explains why management has no clue how unpleasant this job actually is.

Live hangers are experiencing sickness, skin, eye and respiratory irritations, along with musculoskeletal trauma, and potential heat stress. For ergonomic and strain related reasons, these problems can be especially common for smaller men. I say ""men"" because I have never seen a female live hanger, and in my plant all full time hangers are men.

I also believe hangers deserve more pay than they receive. I have done many jobs in the plant and I do not believe hangers should receive a pay so close to that of much easier and less stressful tasks.

HR is usually friendly but not very helpful and they persistently forget to do things you request.

","Unless willing to move to Chicago or Arkansas you are in a dead end job. There is a Sr. Acct. Manager that you could get without moving but getting this promotion is very subjective. There is no written criteria and management just picks favorites so do not count on it. 
 
Whatever was done was criticized. Regardless of what you do it was not right and needed to be done again. Felt like grade school and demeaning. 

 They ask for 360 reviews from your peers for annual review (peers do not even know what you do with your customers) yet they do not ask for 360 reviews on managers to improve as they do not care. There is zero training for management and it shows. 

Very disorganized - they will often send you out the same thing 5 times to redo a different way. 

Inconsiderate deadlines - they will send you stupid stuff and say they need it asap. Or for corporate training with a company deadline this department will make 6 months earlier so the manager looks good. They could care less about you trying to complete all the work that has been dumped on you.

Advice to Management
My advice would be the Golden Rule. Do unto others and you would have them do unto you. Staff and Management can be very disrespectful and harsh at times. Also you find some members of Management that don’t keep things on a professional level when dealing with their employees. Some employees don’t work cause they are friends with Management causing the workload to be heavier on those that do work. Everyone should be treated fairly, justly, respectfully, and evenly. And Managers should have a cofideciallity agreement with their employees. Some things should not be spread across the entire work force to gossip about. Gossip ruins a persons reputation and destroys trust. Therefore it hard to open up to Management and trust them with anything if it’s going to be told to everyone for the sake of making someone look inferior. Management should minimize confrontations and conflict rather than stiring the pot, to keep conflict going in the workplace.

Thu Mar 15 2018, Utility Machine Operator,"Fayetteville, AR",Former Employee ,Utility Machine Operator,0,"Moving up is so easy at Tyson Mexican Original. I saw someone go from being a Machine Operator to a Lead in less than a month. They will always take a chance on you if you have the willingness to apply for the position and want to learn the job. All training is ""on the job"" training. I enjoyed the staff on 2nd shift and they are very flexible if you have something bad happen in your life.
","Some people simply do not want to train you, or they train you wrong so you can get wrote up, or worse fired. This happened to me. Also, there are times where you are not being trained by someone who speaks the same language as you, so that makes it difficult. I had to train myself to learn Spanish just to get through the majority of my training. I think it's unfair that Spanish people are accommodated for training, but not English speakers. Also, there were people who did not have proper training on machines telling me how I was supposed to run the machine when I already knew how. Sexism and slight racism is all over the place. Also, I have seen people pretend to ""play dumb"" and they got out of doing more difficult jobs.

Tue Dec 12 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Capitalism Gone Wrong,1,"My role had better than average pay considering the education, experience and skills I had coming in. Though, I know not all roles can say the same.
","Every time you read a sci-fi story about how corporations have taken over and exploit their employees is what this company is. In my role, we were expected to work 6 days/week, with 10 hours/day being the norm. That's not to say that we didn't have 5 day work weeks, but that's also not to say that we didn't have 7 day work weeks. We were often expected to do everything at the drop of a hat. I was once informed that I had to travel across the country with 24 hours notice. The upper levels of management are either ignorant or indifferent to the poor working conditions. Though, that isn't surprising due to the qualities Tyson seems to value. This is easily the most ""good ol' boy"" company that I have ever encountered. With a number of unqualified people being promoted who seem to make decisions based more out of fear of losing their jobs than doing what is good for their business or their people, it was baffling. While I mentioned that my pay was better than average, the other levels of compensation/benefits left something to be desired. Sick days are an example. I took one day off after being sick and then was told that I was going to have to provide a doctor's note from urgent care if I intended to be sick another day. Not at all what I would expect from a forward-thinking company that values the health of the employees. I was asked on a number of occasions to donate money to Tyson's PAC. The pressure to be a part of that was unprofessional. There are a number of more detailed things I could say, but I've already been less brief than intended.
Advice to Management
Transition into the 21st century. As other major companies are doing things like offering paternity leave, unlimited sick days, and diversified employee bases, you're stuck in an outdated model of thinking. You're the reason that millenials are complaining about corporations. Treat your employees well and they'll treat you well.

Mon Oct 09 2017,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Great Company, Bad Business Unit",1,"Tyson as a whole is a great company and a great company to work for. With the recent acquisitions of Hillshire and Pierre Foods, they have expanded their retail portfolio as well as their opportunities to live and work where you want. Tyson offers a ton of advancement opportunity and both internal and paid external training so Team Members can grow themselves and their career. Pay and benefits are average to exceptional.
","The only thing keeping me from giving Tyson 5 stars is the Fresh Meats business unit. Their corporate management is stuck in the stone age, just like the method for cutting beef and pork. There is still a strong ""good 'ol boys"" club in place as evidenced by the lack of female managers at the director level or above. The managers in place are largely uneducated past high school, which would not be a problem if they were willing to listen to new ideas and processes. Many of these managers appear terrified of technology and treat younger Team Members with disdain when they question the norm rather than embracing this process to make things better. It is also the fresh meats expectation that employees are not working enough if they do not put 55+ hours in each week.

 all loads pretty much only give bare legal time to deliver if that 

 blame drivers for everything so get ready even if they make a mistake they find a way to blame the driver. 

loads are constantly late coming out of plants so when its time to go home BEWARE! You may end up stuck somewhere 1000 miles away for days and noone apologizes. 

Few facilities and most yards are filthy so you can't take showers unless your at a truck stop.

Not a trucking company so when your truck breaks down they dont resources to handle their own work you will hv to get a third party to fix even a flat tire.

Dispatch treats you like a trainee and is often very disrespectful towards drivers.

Low pay and will run you back to back you will only get your required 10hr break nothing more. Sometimes you may work longer than 14hes because loads are not planned based on when you actually finish but just your delivery times.

Now the current regime has ransacked a good southern company , let a lot of good people go, and ,be advised this is NOT a fun place to work at and you will work extremely hard after hours and weekends just to keep from drowning. God forbid if you have a family or want a life outside of work!

Advice to Management
Treat people how you would want to be treated. Stop telling them that they are replaceable when in fact you need them because without them that plant would not run!!! Start working on things before they get beyond repair and when your back is against the wall you wouldn't have to lash out on your managers nor team member. If the plant ran how it should then everyone's job would be secure but it's not so there are insecurities about your position. Stop trying to throw people under the bus when you are on the chopping block. That's why this plant go through so many different managers but look at the ones who are still there. They are the ones throwing people under the bus because they aren't doing their job! Your team is a reflection of you!

But it depends on what location you get. I've heard many good things about many of their other locations.
","I was hired fresh out of college, as a processing plant supervisor. This is a position that they normally full by promoting from within the plant (ie promoting leads to supervisors) but for some reason they decided to hire a few people out of college. They provided almost no training or support for me, and I struggled greatly to learn the ropes as someone who has never worked inside a processing plant before. They had a sink or swim mentality when it came to ""training"" me for the job, which they promised they would do at my interview.

Work/life balance was awful for the salary I was getting, I regularly worked 60-hour weeks as well as several 70-hour weeks. High stress environment, had to deal with issues from everyone: workers, coworkers, bosses, USDA, safety, maintenance, etc.

The lack of support from upper management was the straw that broke the camel's back. Some of my employees held grudges against me because they didn't like the fact that I was 20+ years their junior and a woman of color, was their supervisor. These employees went to HR to say that I acted better than them because I had a college degree...when in fact, I was just doing my job as their supervisor and wrote them up for their bad behavior on the job. Upper management wrote a warning against me, didn't let me defend myself or listen to my side of the story, etc. 

Beware working at a union plant. The union will shield its members from ALL attempted write-ups for bad behavior, missed work, etc. and have them thrown out the window. Therefore the employees can act up all they want and nothing will happen to them, and they know this and take full advantage of it.

I was not the only college graduated hire that felt the same way.
Advice to Management
You need to provide support and proper training for your college grad hires. They may be college educated but that does not mean you can throw them into a high stress production environment with no training and expect them to do well.

","Tyson used to be the company you wanted to work for. It was a company of high morals and a place where you felt at home. Tyson was known for taking care of its employees and making sure people got paid and spent time with their families knowing their job was secure. Ever since the acquisition of Hillshire Brands, Tyson is no more. Everyone who works here might as well just start calling it Hillshire Brands because that is what it has become. From the lying that upper management does to place their people in positions of power to changing of our culture that used to feel like a true southern tradition. We have let another group of people not raised with our morals; to be honest, to treat people right, and to take care of others run amuck our very culture that we have always boasted about. Nobody cares what is going on with the people at the bottom because all people care about is money. Unless I find a new opportunity that proves me otherwise I doubt that I will change a word about this post. Be careful who you can trust at Tyson Foods nowadays.

Not the best communicating between departments. Shuffling, and not having challenging work for your interns leads to slacking off. Also advice to management would be to stop advertising military friendliness when they look down upon current members in the armed forces. 

Wasn't able to be hired for a job because of my military obligation. 

Not a lot of growth around the industry for career opportunities. A lot of sales personal being passed management jobs, because of lack of work ethic. That is the hiring management fault for sustaining/hiring names, instead of specific needs. 

Half the sales force has never worked on the plant floor. How can you sell something when you never prepared it? That is the million dollar question Tyson Foods needs to ask themselves. Can't have a 22 year old College graduate selling something he doesn't believe in. 

Again Military service should be more respected at Tyson Foods.

","OMG this place is surreal. I cannot believe how many self-serving corporate climbers there are in this haven of 'management by powerpoint' coupled with pithy and glib expressions. This place claims they breed innovation--really? how many different ways can you make hot dogs and lunchmeat sexy? Plus if you look at the ingredients on these things, look for the magic words 'mechanically separated chicken ( or turkey)'--google that, but only after you have had lunch and hopefully not after you ate one of those items. This place is a morale killer with zero work-life balance and is not good for your soul...why is that? Because many of the managers here don't have a soul. I was a project manager and I was severely bullied out of my job by my 'see you next Tuesday' boss under the guise of helping me and having HR sit with us while she 'helped' me. What a crock. Most of these managers are recycled from Kraft and vice versa and just job hop away from issues and get promoted. Makes you wonder why they left a great job, unless they were being exposed for the scam artists they really are.

When operating a third party facility owned by Tyson, please listen to the employees about work conditions. The management suffered terribly by having supervisors that give privelege to certain workers, while treating others like monkeys working them to death.

The boss may get transferred or promoted because the plant may have closed and he or she probably knows nothing but sure doesn't want to let that be known but its obvious by the things they tell you that need to be done. Each and every plant runs differently especially in logistics in Holcomb. My advice to management above me is look at the facts on paper and the performance you made us compare to the other plants and we kicked butt but you let a couple power trippers come in that didn't have a clue and run alot of your good performers off and then later realize they were the problem. Then you fired them because of lack of knowledge and now look where that facility is at. Now take your own advice corporate and except the responsibility, you made some poor decisions and you listened instead of looking over all of those graphs you made us spend countless hours preparing that you never looked at.
