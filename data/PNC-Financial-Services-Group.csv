Advice to Management
Listen to the employees that are not in a leadership role. Your leaders are not leading. The actual branch atmosphere is toxic and it’s being hidden by your managers, Ssms, and Regionals. Manager surveys are being answered truthfully, employees are going through the chain of command asking for help, even going to HR and trying to draw attention to what the branch culture is like and are only being shunned/ignored. Look closely at what’s happening at the branch level. Willful negligence is causing employees to leave. PNC sells you this dream of succeeding in your role but neglect to tell you it’s not hard work that will get you there. It’s whether you are liked enough to be promoted. PNC is a wonderful company at first glance but when it comes down to how employees are being treated, you’re failing. You’re burning out employees who love their job only to cater to sub par employees who upper management love. PNC is somewhere you are proud to say you work for, I used to say that. But never will I recommend anyone to work there because I would never allow someone to be subjected to that type of toxic workplace. I was proud until I realized that the support you promise to your employees, is not truthfully there. I can only speak from the experience of my region. But that experience taught me a lot. I hope one day the girls club culture will change there and enable employees to fully advance based on their skills and potential.

I've worked with some amazing, and also awful managers over my 5 years with the company. They do have a great training program, so if you're completely new to banking PNC will teach you everything there is to know so you can be ready to perform your job!
","Company claims to ""value"" their employees, but this has been the worst company to work for where ""raises"" are almost insulting, and it can be challenging to move up in the company. PNC publicly announces their growth, and the amount of money they spent to buy out other banks, but when it comes to valuing their employees, and helping them salary wise they could care less. There is also a HUGE constant turnover rate with PNC. They have very strict policies and procedures, and if you steer them wrong one time they'll just fire you no matter how long you've been with the company.

Advice to Management
treat your employees well and they will do their best for the customers. happy employees = happy customers = happy management. either work on making the metrics more reasonable/less stressful or work on the resources employees have to do their jobs. fix the technology so it stops crashing all the time. update your employee emulation tools so we can fully service our customers with confidence.

- Good work life balance
","- Salary is much below market average without much room for a raise
- Promotions are very team dependent - in my experience, no one on my team got a promotion, the two years I was there
- Overloaded with work and understaffed
- Not a good place for diversity and inclusion
- Upper management strategy often shifts so years of work are sometimes discarded
- Very slow, lots of legal constraints, not much room for innovation
- Management is very stingy with money
- Not a competitive environment for career growth, most teammates just there for a steady, 9-5 job
- Company culture is very rigid for a tech role
- Basically next to nothing company and team culture - didn't feel like anyone was happy to go to work, teammates were very private, never wanting to do any team events
Advice to Management
Experience and pay is very subjective depending on team, but is not competitive with the market. Need to figure out a way to retain employees by giving them opportunities to move upward and improve company culture. Need to advance your technology and processes.

Management complacency due to politics/organizational complexity/competing priorities makes project work cumbersome, have to actively pursue opportunities through networking/self learning/exploration/exposure, be conscious of what level you enter the company at as HR can sometimes throttle you if you’re ambitious and looking to advance quickly, having clear and actionable goals and tracking through to completion is absolutely necessary for promotions

Advice to Management
While I love how pnc handled the begining of the pandemic. And spoke great things about the company about how they responded to protect their staff. Since trying to resume lobby openings things have gone down hill quickly for those ok the front lines..

Communicate with the front line and branches before you make decisions, ask how it may effect them. If they have any helpful ideas that could help solve the problems youre trying to fix because they may have some good ideas. Don't cut positions in the busiest branches, show you care about your employees instead of just ""telling"" them. Stop being so aggressive with sales. 

Seriously, your staffs mental health is dwindling. Were being spread too thin, and im not sure how much longer we will all be able to hold on before we reach our breaking point. 

Not enough staff is available to try to accommodate opening lobby and essentially causing more delays and chaos within good branches. When a consistent 5 star branch is getting bad surveys, I think you should know there is a problem. Until we can effectively cover enough positions to open lobby safely, we should go back to drive thru only, and perhaps revert back to cohorts to protect the mental and physical health of our staff.

","Compensation for internal transfers is not very competitive, even when moving up between job bands/levels. Year to year merit increases are also pretty stagnant, no matter how well the company is doing financially. Company culture is all over the board depending on what line of business you're in. In some groups, running oneself ragged and being in a state of burnout is not only normal, but seemingly a badge of honor. The open address floor plan that most downtown Pittsburgh offices transitioned to were a nightmare to work in.
Advice to Management
Seriously re-consider the company policy and culture regarding raises for employees who move up from one career level to the next. Or rather, the widespread practice of NOT giving raises when an employee moves internally to a position that is a promotion for them. The fact that the pay bands overlap should not be an excuse to give employees a promotion without a raise for 6-12 months. Or, allow wage stagnation (i.e. Give a raise that that matches inflation). If you want to be competitive and attract talent outside of the local market--which ought to be the direction the company considers going in when it's become apparent that it can operate large swaths of its back office teams remotely--then it's time to look at compensation philosophy.

","Lots. First, my biggest issue, upper management is out of touch no matter what position you have. Since reopening fully from COVID restrictions it’s has been nothing but sales goals talk and business as usual, despite these being far from normal times. We are also constantly asked to take on new responsibility but no pay increases. Add to it that with COVID sales which you get incentive from have plummeted in the bank proper and we are going to be making less money and there is zero talk of pay restructuring despite consistently great financials for the bank.

The healthcare plan is abysmal. A high deductible plan that essentially leaves you paying out of pocket up to 2500 or 5k. A large medical expense would have crippled me financially. 

CEO is also out of touch. The issue of compensation came up last year, when employees weren’t even receiving cost of living raises despite record profits...the CEO literally said in a blog if you want a raise you need to get a promotion. That is great to say in theory, but when you have a pay scale that caps raises when you move internally and 50 people applying to every job it is unrealistic.

All these reasons are why I recently left for a competitor bank. I got a larger raise than I would have anywhere in PNC, they have better healthcare, and they are actively evaluating how they pay employees in light of COVID.
Advice to Management
First off, pay more. Second off, stop killing us with sales goals talks. Maybe come into the branch and try it yourself if you think it is so easy? It often seems all you care about is making yourself look good to your boss. Branch level management is generally good but regional managers are horrible in my experience.

Advice to Management
I was misled from the start. I interviewed with an Advisor that I would be specifically involved in helping. I mean it was the main point of them opening the position; additionally, I was told that I would be helping take the work load off of him and be able to bring in client as well. He told me eventually down the road that he would even give me some of the clients that he didn't have the time to allocate to. It sounded like a great position coming from me being an advisor for 2 years and wanted to try something different. 
Once I started, things were good for about 2 months. I would constantly ask if he needed me to do anything and the answer most of the time was NO. It didn't bother me because he would involve me in his meetings and we would occasionally grab lunch. He would say ""I'm glad that you're here"" a lot. However, this all ended suddenly and the guy would avoid speaking and I wasn't invited to meetings anymore. I basically would sit there all day with nothing to do. It was a very AWKWARD position to be in. After months of this going on, I receive a random call from his manager talking down on me about how I'm not doing what I was hired to do. The advisor told him that he didn't need me and I was never made aware of anything from the advisor. I mean I sat right beside the advisor in the office. Lack of communication and a rude manager. By the way, he magically started speaking after I got this phone call so go figure. 

Fast forward a couple of months, I go off to the military to join the reserves. I let the manager know ahead of time and everything was ok for me to come back after Basic and Tech School. I come back from the military after 5 months and start back working from home because of Covid. My manager calls to welcome me back and to tell me that things are well since I left and he doesn't want to change how they are, which was fine. So I'm no longer assisting the advisors that I worked with before leaving. I get a ""special"" assignment that is basically data entry for one of the top advisors. Also, I ask about my bonus which is one of the reasons I took the job and was part of the pay I agreed to. I was told I would still receive my bonus. However, I would constantly keep getting asked was I even licensed and I have the series 7, 66 and ins licenses. I'm guessing once I returned, my licenses may have disappeared. Well to conclude this story. I never received my bonus and on top of that, my manager seemed like he started singling me out. One time, I received an email about my Instant Messenger saying I was offline 14 hours and well if you log off at 5pm and get back on at 7am, I believe that's common sense and everyone else's said the same thing or longer sooooo kinda felt a little harassed at that point. I should have taken this to HR but I ended up getting another job the next week. Before that, I call him because I had an emergency and he let me off work but proceeded to fuss at me because the advisor wasn't giving me the information that I needed fast enough for me to have something to do during the day. It never made sense to me but I was near the point that I knew I needed a new job. I know this is long but hopefully it can help someone make a decision if they are in the hiring process for this position. I usually don't leave reviews but this was a HORRIBLE experience in my career.

Thu Oct 08 2020, Branch Banker Associate,,Current Employee ,Great for first two years but now uneasiness and dread,1,"Good folks to work with, product benefits for employees, health insurance and other tools provided for financial and physical well-being. When I first began working at PNC, I felt like I was valued and that there was a structure in place to help me succeed not only in my position, but within the company as a whole.
","PNC has changed since I first began working here. Earlier this year it was announced they would be removing the incentive for Branch Banker Associates (formerly BSSR and otherwise known as a universal banker) and it really crushed the upward mobility of the position. While any incentive bonus I had received was added to my yearly salary, going forward I can do the same tasks as a Banker but I will not receive any incentive. The role of a universal banker has great utility but at PNC this change has translated into an environment where I feel less valued than Bankers and, additionally, I no longer have a system or any concrete numbers I can point to should I seek promotion or employment elsewhere. Additionally, I have seen PNC engage in some really harmful practices that hurt the core workforce - most noticeably, sudden announcements which seems to suggest that folks in different departments or lines of business are being laid off with little to no warning. I have also felt that PNC’s response to a COVID diagnosis in my branch was absolutely lacking in structure or transparency. While my manager did their best to field questions and provide information, they were not given clear next steps to keep us informed, safe, or assured - multiple coworkers and I found out that it would be a struggle to quarantine due to possible exposure. While the general guideline from health officials at the time has been to quarantine for two weeks, we were left confused as to whether or not we would have to use vacation time or risk a cut to our pay in order to stay safe.
Advice to Management
At the time of writing it seems PNC is in a period of transition as they implement changes that focus more on digital banking. This is evidenced by more branches closing in regions and consolidated. I understand this change and the right for a company to alter how they provide services - however, respect for employees and their loyalty is critical, especially for employees who are frontline and can often be most susceptible to economic and public health changes.

Wed Sep 16 2020, Mortgage Loan Officer,"Cleveland, OH",Current Employee ,The truth!,0,"- PNC favors long term employees. Some of the mortgage officers (mostly managment) has worked for the company for 10+ years. Career longevity thrives here!
- Work life balance is ample and almost illegal how much freedom you have.
- Awesome Employee benefits with pension plan.
","- Compensation plan is horrible. 
Base salary is painful. You get Bps deduction for everything possible even for operational errors.
-PNC does not support its loan officers. As a loan officer, you will spend more time as a liaison between the operation/processing departments than getting more loans. Processors does not call clients or share with loan officers any timely updates. You can count on one hand the good processors the company has. Let’s blame the “bad apples”.
- Poor operational/processing system.
Great for jumbo loans (nerd wallet) or the wealthy clientele. Especially if you earn a high income and substantial account balance or retirement account in the millions usually that you can transfer to PNC.
- Loans never closes on time.
Usually take 90 days for a refinance, even before the pandemic. Every realtor you come in contact with will let you know this “PNC = Purchase Never Close”. 

The combination of these put officers at the possibility of never earning a substantial commission.

","Corporate personnel get to stay home during covid until 2021 but customer facing retail employees do not even receive proper cleaning products, hours were extended and lobbies opened. Pressure to meet goals, micromanaging from branch manager and regional manager. Training revolves around products but your job will mainly be problem solving. Old computer system. Long days working till 6p,alternating Saturdays which feel like a regular work day making it 6 work days. ALOT OF BRANCHES ARE SHORT HANDED DUE TO RECENT LAYOFFS, managers get mad at you because you don’t have “conversations” and customers get mad because of the long wait time. Work life balance is non existent. Pay increases are not given to even the best of employees for years. Retaliation if you speak your mind. Your expected to figure out how to do your job. These are all facts...I was really hoping on making PNC my long term career.
Advice to Management
If you keep pressuring your retail employees to meet goals, blatantly treat corporate employees better while extending branch employee hours, pressuring employees to use their vacation time if they show obvious signs of Covid, allowing branch managers to run their branch under their opinions, your company is going to fail. PNC can’t get clients without the front line being strong, and right now your front line is crumbling.

Understanding how to manage your employees in a respectful manner is extremely important.

This is easily one of the worst companies I have worked for. I am appalled by the lack of vision and direction of this company. If there is a company which appears messy, that is bad, but worse than that is a company which pretends and puts up window-dressing that it is one of the best, etc.
I will NOT recommend even my enemy to this company.
Leaders (Managers, Directors, CIOs as well) are rude and openly violate the basic courtesy rules and policies of PNC (CARES and iLEAD policies of PNC). To add to the mess are dinosaurs who are with the bank for decades and who think they are the kings and queens.
Pathetic !!

Sat Jul 25 2020, Mortgage Loan Officer,,Former Employee ,Pay is far below market and underwriting is very inconsistent,1,"Co-workers are very friendly and hardworking
","Antiquated technology but they call it cutting edge. Commissioned employees are asked to physically do time-consuming work arounds that are done electronically at other lenders. Dismal loan pull-through rate. The company knows of inconsistency in underwriting but nothing changed. BPS subtracted from pay for things the MLO has no control over. Co-workers constantly talk about leaving - low retention.
Advice to Management
Listen to your MLO specifically the ones that have experience with your competitors - other mortgage lenders. My experience was that the MLO's asked to participate in panels were MLO's that had been at PNC for ever and had nothing new to bring to the discussion new or updated so we continue to be outdated and management can say we had input from your peers but those peers only knew the PNC way . Revamp the mortgage training group. Their goal is not to truly train but to check off that they have done this particular thing. 30 minute group call watching them on skype pushing buttons and clicking links does not equal trainng. Make it part of their responsibility/compensation to respond positively to those that reach out to for additional training when that 30 minutes on line watching them do something does not work. They make you feel bad for wanting to actually learn what you are suppose to learn. Currently if you email them for additional training they email back that they have already conducted that training so go to your Manager or co worker if you need more training. Leadership saids they want to hear from you and feel free to ask questions but when you do your hands are slapped.

Unless you’re incredibly comfortable with door knocking on new businesses every day, don’t even consider it. You will start and end your day telling management what you did every second of the day, making the micromanagement unbearable. And as the cherry on top, you have no career opportunities unless you want to move to the East Coast, or move to a loan servicing institution they hold. The salary is lovely, but you will ALWAYS be working over 40 hours a week. Oh, and be prepared to work evenings and Saturdays.

","AML Operations is the Perfect Example of a TOXIC Work Environment

You haven't lived until you've received, in February 2019, an invitation from a senior manager for a process improvement meeting called ""Make AML Great Again"". And senior management ran the department just like the current occupant of the White House. Yes, you read that correctly, and of course this happened during Black History Month. 

Senior management is clueless, and are only interested in hearing from ""yes men"" who blindly agree with management's ideas. If you ask for clarification on something, you are marked as ""difficult"" and will be targeted accordingly, a process referred to by AML senior management and team leads as being ""managed out of PNC"". The team leads/managers that distribute the work do so in a bullying fashion at the direction of senior management, by assigning employees that are not viewed in a favorable light by management an abundance of cases with ""expedited due dates"", or an abundance of ""high risk"" cases involving more thorough reviews, or assigning in such a way that all cases for that week are due on Mondays, combined with revoking teleworking privileges while also limiting building access hours. After asking a valid question about case assignments during a ""questions"" portion of a meeting about case assignments, one of the bullying team leads took my manager aside and told them to ""get me under control"". Meanwhile, this female team lead was doing the work of a male direct report for him after hours.

Also, there are a little over 20 Quality Analysts that review the work of the Investigators. Once senior management decided to target me, I had the same 3-4 Quality Analysts over the next 3 years, although they are supposedly randomly assigned. The Quality Analysts assigned to me combed through my work with a fine-toothed comb, looking for any reason to reject it. Senior management went outside of our clearly written procedures TWICE, just to reject my work. I documented the actual procedures in their respective cases to show the departure from the procedures. Each team was required to have daily morning meetings where we would discuss our work and its progress. It became glaringly obvious to my team that my work was held to a much higher standard than the rest of my team.

I have witnessed an employee actually stay in the building overnight due to trying to meet deadlines due to intentional case overloads while dealing with building access that is cut off earlier for them than the rest of the employees. That employee was fired upon returning to work the following morning after going home to take a shower.

The fact that INTEGRITY is one of PNC's core values is laughable in AML Operations. Employee Relations/Human Resources is just an extension of AML Operation's discriminatory actions, and only serve to identify employees for retaliation including being interrogated and falsely accused by a VP from HR interrogate about a disability for which PNC already had the required documentation. HR operates however they want to with absolutely no regard for the law, demanding that employees use personal phones for communication with them so that the conversation does not occur on a recorded line. If everything that PNC's HR department does is supposed to be above board, why the secrecy and demands that a non-official means of communication be used?

*There is supporting documentation available for every statement made in this review*
Advice to Management
This is what you get when simple-minded, racist individuals insist on being the smartest person in the room: chaos, mismanagement, and high turnover.

Salary & Wages are below market in many areas of the company; they emphasize customer service via NPS Scores from customer surveys (but really want you to cross-sale and sell their useless Virtual Wallet Checking account so the customer has three accounts to manage & thet can collect more fees); they have use COVID19 as a rational to completely shut down their branch lobby's to force customers to buy into their ""digital bank"" concept, while customer's sit for hours at drive-thru's to conduct their banking from their car; customer service call center reps are all virtual with little to no support from useless group & team leads who refuse to take customer escalation calls; and force their consultants to either hang up on the abusive customer or ""wear the customer down"" to the point they finally give up, resulting in them calling back even more irate. Their website and mobile banking platform is atrocious and pre-1990 along with their computer/phone systems. Customers repeatedly are disconnected on by their phone IVRU or while on hold because their phone system cannot handle load & employees are virtual with various ISP and connections involved.

No acknowledgment, no phone call, but she sure had my network access terminated. Thankfully, I had already took a distribution from my 401(k) and rolled it over to my IRA before they shut off my access (i.e. I knew they would do something like this to hold up my money and final paycheck, so I called up HR several weeks before turning in my notice, told them to process a full distribution for COVID19 hardship & rolled it over into my IRA BEFORE turning in my resignation).

Sun Apr 19 2020, Part Time Teller,,Former Employee ,Do your reasearch first.,0,"For full-time employees they offer a great benefit package and several wellness incentives. They strongly support movement up within the company, to the point of offering paid shadowing opportunities in whichever position you would like. They also offer bonuses for meeting specs. They are also very charity oriented and allow employees to participate in their charity events, sometimes paid.
","Part-time employees are taken advantage of, being regularly scheduled 32-39.9 hours and only receiving half of the benefits of full-time employees. Also, it is still 5-6 days a week, just for an hour or less a day. You are also made to work 2 Saturdays every month, at the nearest bank open on Saturdays. At the branch level, the employees are very competitive and vindictive in order to get promoted within the branch or to make themselves look better. I learned this the hard way, not expecting that level of despicable behavior.
Customer surveys are very heavily relied on for bonuses and can effect your bonus even if it had nothing to do with you. Its all about the stars you receive. Meeting metrics, even as a teller, can be tied to your pay. They turn you into a sales person. Pay is low compared to the market, however, if you factor in the full-time employee benefits, it could be a win for you depending on your needs.

Tue Mar 17 2020,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Exciting technology terrible management,1,"The ambition of the executive leadership team is exciting. 
The experience is what you make of it.
Several opportunities to work on different projects if management favors you.
You are paid highly to compensate for how little other people do work.
","The middle management implementing the technical capabilities of the bank's vision is ill-equipped for the job. 
There is zero leadership at the director level or down. 
For the technology aspect, most managers are there only because of length of employment not because they understand management. 
If you speak up and have suggestions, you'll be retaliated against and denied advancement. 
Management will dangle a carrot for career advancement, once you achieve it, they'll re-establish a different baseline and revoke the original expectation.
Management says one thing but their behavior speaks otherwise.
If you want to work on a team that's accountable, look elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Trust the people you hire. Let them do their jobs. Trim the deadweight. Stop the staffing model where your top 3% carry the load of the rest of the teams. Learn what management means. Each day if you are good at your job, 5 other people get by without doing work. Learn both how to manage AND how to hold people accountable before delegating your job to your subordinates.

Advocate better for employees to be paid what enterprise claims they want to pay employees. I didn't expect a particular pay until I was made aware of my role's""compensation band"". Direct manager and upper management was ""comfortable"" with employees being below the minimum of the company determined ""target salary range"".

But good luck getting a raise after that. They have benefits mainly good time off compared to most and many options for your schedule. Coworkers while lacking in ability are generally nice people and lower mgmt does seem to care as much as they're allowed to.
","Incompetent coworkers EVERYWHERE. Lack of training in cross depts leaves a qualified few to pick up the pieces of everyone else mistakes. To the point you wonder how this bank keeps any customers. High turn over of employees. Very few opportunities to advance beyond a notch or two above a normal consultant. Benefits dont cover any costs with insurance. The upper management decisions and goals are set clearly by people who dont know the jobs being performed and has been steadily growing more and more away from employee friendly policies constantly squeezing more out of you while never paying you a penny more for it. Communication of important information and changes typically comes far too late. Directly witnessed failure of upper management to follow thru on promises of pay and incentives and no one seemed to care, border line wage theft. This might be a good place to get your foot in the door in your first career or so but most dont stay longer than 2 years or so for good reason. By then the company doesnt care to promote you or train you more than necessary. Your just a number to them.

Massive overhaul of training. Keep wages in line with inflation over time. You have the CEO boasting about billion dollar quarters but employees never see any of the investment back on them. Last year alone when all to shareholder via massive stock buybacks, which the CEO cashing in 11 million in stocks in ONE DAY right after the buybacks were done. This is publicly accessible information btw Google it (financial news reported this in November 2019 so its recent wouldn't surprise me if still occuring). Get upper management in touch with the ground floor who do know what they are doing. Then shut up and listen.

Sun Jan 19 2020,Anonymous,"Pittsburgh, PA",Former Employee ,"Solid company, but ready to move on",3,"- They check all the boxes for a prospective employee. Good salary, good benefits, strong financials.
- Stable C-level leadership with consistent vision for the future.
","- Too many meetings. There are meetings to discuss what to talk about at the next meeting. 100 people on a call, 10 people participating. There are people making over six figures who literally do nothing but schedule and emcee meetings.
- Modeling activities are crazy over-administered. For every one person performing an analysis or developing an enhancement, there are five people setting up meetings, pestering staff to fill out forms and documents, asking for ETA, and generally not being productive or helpful. Management's approach to difficult projects is to throw more project managers at it. Instead of sourcing experienced staff for project management roles, they hire inexperienced staff and give them unearned authority.
- Many staff responsible for challenging and checking work, but this work is not collaborative. Quality control personnel have little knowledge of the data or product and do not strive to learn.
- Work is impersonal, no effort is spent on team building. People don't respect each other's time or care to get to know each other.

Sat Jan 11 2020, Retail Bank,,Current Employee ,"Good place to learn, bad place for a career",2,"-The performance based culture of the retail creates an environment where you are forced to learn and sets you up for a higher paying job at another institution. PNC is viewed as a good talent pool for institutions that pay better with similar expectations.
-Benefits are good for corporate culture
-Great culture and work-life balance outside of the retail bank (I've worked in other parts of the bank). Low turnover, high work life balance, reasonable performance expectations. 
-Demchak(CEO) is really talented CEO and an elite great capital allocator so the bank isn't going anywhere unless its acquired for the shareholders benefit.
","-The goals are insane compared to the investment that the bank wants to make in talent in the retail bank. They want top performance from people that are brand new to banking, banker pay is worse than the teller pay at our competitors, and the bank pretends to be a culture driven bank. I think it's very hard for anywhere to be low paying & demand top performance, while claiming to being employee focused. Better to just admit what you are. Examples: BoA, bad culture - high performance requirements - but well paid. First Citizens - low pay, low/medium performance expectations, good culture. 
-The organizations retail bank is significantly behind it's peer in compensation
-The retail bank is micro managed down to every click, call, and appointment. It's a terrible place to be a middle manager.
Advice to Management
The disconnect between the retail banks senior leadership and strategy teams compared to the actual operations of the day to day of the sales teams of the bank is astounding. The company is incredibly siloed except for the retail employee that is the person asked to drive everything for everyone and we're the worst paid, which I think is so strange. The territory/market/regional management talks around its expectations to avoid a public Wells Fargo disaster, but it says and expects the same production with astronomical goals. The incentive structures for retail managers is based off of people outside of your control and built by strategist with little operating experience. The service measurements are smart in theory, but they've made it impossible to attain and it is impacted by people outside of retails hierarchy, so it is incredibly un-motivating because you will work you really hard and then at the end of the quarter you'll lose a bonus because of someone or something that you had zero control over, and the leadership just says ""it's tough, but that's the way it is, we'll get them next time."" Easy to say, when now I can't afford a vacation or school tuition because a partner that I don't manage provided a poor experience and I was penalized or a customer misunderstood the form scoring scale, they state that on a recorded call with great reviews and we're told to bad. I think Karen Larrimer & Todd Barnhart would benefit from spending time with and hearing from above average employees about their frustrations, when they're not around market/regional leadership. Everything they hear is filtered for praise and compliments, for the rank and file things have gotten so much worse over the last 3-4 years.

ALSO, the computers constantly crash on you and the internet goes down during important tasks. the tech and hr do not care. then you are rated on how you perform by the client. if they give you less then 10/10 then everyone gets mad at you. even if they get the low score, they still get mad at the new person and blame it on them because there has been a ""change"". its just bullying at it's finest. overall, it is a hostile environment that pays the bills.

How they confided in you & trusted you with their finances. I had 2 pay raises in 5 years, let that tell you something. This was an incredible company to work for, then it quickly went downhill. When I mean quickly, I mean QUICKLY.
","You’re severely micromanaged. Sales will consume your life. You will come to work stressed & go home stressed. Do NOT share anything personal with ANYONE!! Go to work, do you job, go home. Simple. Things are getting more intense in this company, turnover is awful, they just recently closed one branch & it was so sudden an employee was without a job for months. That’s not fair. You will be treated terrible if you struggle AT ALL. Oh & if you’re pregnant, they will find the smallest flaw & WILL FIRE YOU.
Advice to Management
Please remember people have personal lives. Not everyone lives in luxury like you do with your $50k a year job while the rest of us are making less than $25k which is SEVERELY underpaid. Have compassion & quit treating everyone like a number. Quit taking your anger out on your employees when your big boss wants to act like a child. Oh yeah; the regional manager in this region.. SHE IS HORRIBLE. Please be careful. Better yet, please work for another institution.

Fri Nov 15 2019, Digital Product Manager,"Pittsburgh, PA",Current Employee ,Great place to work.....for Pittsburgh,2,"It's a fun, fast-paced officer where employees are given a lot of autonomy. The digital team has pretty smart management and they really look after their employees - probably more so than other divisions, from what I have heard. Pay is good for the region. You often hear people complain about being underpaid, but I think that is true every where. I think people also expect San Fran/NYC salaries for digital positions, despite being in a low CoL area like Pittsburgh.
","I think the Digital team and resources are smaller than some of the industry-leaders, and the products can be a compromise because of that. You're not going to build an industry-leading digital product, you're going to do amazing things considering the resources. Pay is what it is - good for the region, bad compared to the industry.
Advice to Management
As the digital team is growing, it's important to empower new managers to be decision makers, not middlemen. And, on the other side of the coin, it is important for managers who suddenly have much larger teams, to yield decision-making responsibility to subordinates. Decision-making is more of a bottleneck than production, right now.

Tue Oct 22 2019, Business Systems Analyst,"Pittsburgh, PA",Current Employee ,Good and Bad,6,"There are a lot of pros for working at PNC: 
- Some WFH flexibility 
- Generally a good culture of people
- Focus on Work/Life balance, which is huge for a lot of people 
- Focus on promoting from within and assuring ""the right person for the right job,"" which means there is mobility within the company if an opportunity comes up. 
- They offer a pension, which is a little unique since most companies do not anymore.
- Paid time off is on par now with market (3 weeks PTO to start, plus sick leave and personal day.)
","Some cons: 
- Pay seems to be below market for some of the roles. Attitude towards salary and merit increases from CEO are: ""Why should we pay you more to do the same thing? Look to another role in the company if you want paid more."" Pay seems to be a big reason why people leave. 
- Benefits are there, but all options are high deductible garbage. 
- Some folks have gotten WFH options removed based on title alone, not performance. It is a huge perk and one that would drive people away if removed.
- The 2 PNC office space: It is open office and ""free address,"" so not only do you get packed in line sardines, you aren't always guaranteed the same seat. It puts employees on edge all day, and everyone screams over each other in conference calls. It's impractical and reduces productivity. (Also another reason WFH is so important to continue to offer!)
- Management hires people as ""tokens"" then gives them work unrelated to what they thought they were hired to do. Like hiring a very technical person into a BSA role saying that being technical is an asset to the role, but then saddling them with administrative work that anyone off the street could do. Doesn't utilize their skills effectively.
Advice to Management
-Recognize that your employees who work hard deserve pay increases, not just for doing ""the same job,"" but because they've dedicated time to become experts in the environment and mostly take on larger projects/requests as they become familiar with the job, even if in the same title. 
- Find ways to accommodate folks in 2 PNC who have to deal with the open floor plan madness. Assure WFH is available when needed for just sanity purposes lol. 
- Investigate market value for different roles so that folks don't leave to pursue more money elsewhere.

","I believe PNC Bank offers competitive pay and good benefits, however, the department I currently work in is poorly managed, to say the least. As a result, the general work environment is based on fear, no work/life balance and employee burn out. The company supposedly embraces work/balance, but senior management doesn't seem to question why employees quit often, many times just by walking out. The work itself is interesting, but divide between the teams (which in some instances is borderline bullying), excessive workload, the unreasonable expectations which change and increase often, the outdated systems that break frequently and management's unwillingness to even listen to employee's recommendations for improvement, fosters a very toxic working environment. As a result of these issues, employees have to work very long hours for weeks on end. Even taking vacation time or getting sick is a cause of major stress, because of the amount of hours we have to work to make sure the work is done on time, so basically, the paid time off is paid back. There is no communication. The QA group has more power on investigators' performance ratings than their managers, who are afraid to challenge QA management.
Advice to Management
Consider really listening to your employees. Also consider taking a closer look at how QA analyst are evaluated vs, investigators and realize there is a huge conflict there. Remember that the employees working for you are people, many with families, not disposable machines you can replace with contractors. Truly demonstrate sincere appreciation for your employees efforts. Wonder why so many people have left and why just about everybody is looking to get out. If that doesn't paint an accurate picture of areas that need improvement, I don't know what would.

Thu Oct 03 2019,N/A,, ,Property Preservation Analyst,4,"Nice work/life balance. You can leave work at the office without worrying about it while you’re off. Decent vacation time, so-so benefits. Some departments offer work from home ability.
","The longer you are in a department the more vulnerable you become. I have been in this department for three years and the roster has gone from 30 employees to 10 with no new hires. You will get a 1% raise whether you cure cancer or just do the minimum. If you are promoted, it takes two years before your pay is bumped up into the target range and that is if you’re performance jives with middle management’s agenda. If you do have the ambition to rise to the top, you are told you must move from department to department, or in some cases to other companies, before you be considered for a promotion. 

Pay is below industry standard and a badge of honor for upper management. Those higher up consistently advise lower employees with designs on moving through the company of they want more pay, they’re better off somewhere else. 

Department managers are mandated what rankings they can give their employees, including being forced to rank at least one employee as unsatisfactory even if they are adequate. 

Middle management is not well-versed in the departments they run but use the basic knowledge they have to stall departmental developments with petty discussions about procedures that have been altered several times over, in a calendar year. 

Computer/based trainings that are broad-stroke, press release material are passed to all employees no matter how little they may relate to their job function. Middle management then gets bonuses based on lower level employees completing the training timely, meaning middle management ensures top priority is placed on the computer-based training and not the actual job functions assigned to each employee. 

Middle management is constantly monitoring department managers, on the look out for any wrongdoing that they can throw in their faces. In my specific department, three years ago, there were three department managers. Middle management has trimmed that to one, making sure that department manager shoulders all three of the former managers’ responsibilities, plus departmental audits, and then slaps that manager with an unsatisfactory rating ensuring they will not have to give that manager a raise. Middle management is constantly loading up the department manager with meetings so that the department manager is rarely available to help employees, or complete their own individual assignments, and then gets docked for not completing certain tasks.

There is a general aura of anxiety once you walk in the door as you await your department’s inevitable deletion.
Advice to Management
Trust your employees more. They’ve stuck with you only to be rewarded with far more work and expectations with zero appreciation. Ensure middle management is knowledgeable of the departments the lead before giving them the ability to crush the spirits and ambitions of the employees beneath them. Stop pretending the computer based trainings are enlightening your employees and really scrutinize their relevancy for given departments.

Time off for new parents is great. Has Pension and 401(k).
","Pay tends to be well below market, there are massive shifts in business strategy and turnover within leadership in the Asset Management Group. Idea are seldom valued unless they are created by a select few that have managed to remain at the top of strategy. 

Goals are relatively nonexistent ... given the high level business model tends to change every two years and the organization Always seems to be in a “figuring it out” mode. 

Product set within the asset management group is solid but far behind the curve of other competitors and big names. 

Mentality tends to be one that employees should be grateful to be employed and to be allowed to do business on behalf of PNC. 

Bonuses and raises are subject to whoever your manager is at the time and if they are new to their role expect upper management to give minimal dollars so they can afford to pay those who are at risk of leaving due to chronic under-compensation and appreciation.

","Technology is HORRIBLE. Why anyone banks with PNC is beyond me. 

Middle managers think they know everything, they don’t listen to opposing or new points of view. Any attempt at innovation is looked at with contempt. Frequent turnover from the top down in Comms. Great colleagues are chased away by paranoid middle managers who pick favorites and dump 
on everyone else. I’ve seen people nearly get fired because a manager messes up, and she blames someone on her team. (All the managers are women, so I’m not calling out a specific person.)

Middle managers don’t seem to actually get any work done, not unless you consider scheming against their own peers work. They produce NOTHING! They spend their time micromanaging and “sitting in” on meetings they don’t need to attend. They are supposed to be developing their teams, but “just don’t have the time” to do any real coaching. 

 We have managers who report to other managers and people with the title of manager who don’t manage anyone. When eNPS scores come in low, we do a lot of talking but nothing changes. People won’t speak up because they fear retaliation. 

HR, employee relations and upper management talk a whole lot about creating a great place to work. I haven’t seen a single positive change. Things just get progressively worse. 

Also, healthcare benefits have gotten lousy.
Advice to Management
Educate, demote or get rid of middle managers who consistently receive poor eNPS scores. They are making a mockery of internal communications.

","Company has no real guiding principles they stand by or want to be known for. It’s all about them, not the customer is seems. Training isn’t too bad, but they throw you to the wolves to answer calls before you’re even finished training. You will get calls about things you haven’t learned yet and have to place clients on hold to reach out to a mentor for help. But at the same time they don’t want you to place people on hold long or have long phone calls. They micromanage everything you do. They monitor your computer at all times & if they ‘think’ you’re not paying attention or taking too long to read a training module, they will ask you what you’re doing. They have 3 quality calls a month, which isn’t too bad. But even when you have good ones, they find something to pick apart that seems like they’re just reaching for something to complain about. They are very strict about schedule adherence, which can be difficult if you have an elderly client having issues with OLB. They want to make sure you have great first call resolution, but don’t want you to completely help someone walk through the issue they’re having. When I was in training & transition over half of our class had quit (went from 17 teammates to 8) because the company just has horrible training, transition and procedures
