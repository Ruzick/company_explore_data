","Career progression is very difficult - even for employees with consistently high ratings. Must move to a different company in order to get a promotion.
Generally, people managers are not focused on managing people - only a few show excellence in this regard. (Not that different industry wide)
There is some bureaucracy that was starting to slow things down more than was necessary to mitigate risk
Less competitive in salaries/benefits than realized until leaving

Sat Jan 23 2021, Senior Scientist,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Current Employee ,Amgen needs to be brave and create opportunities for emerging Scientists,2,"Solid company and benefits. Good moral compass and eye for social/societal issues. Good picture science. On a granular mid-management level, there are challenges.
","After a while, growth prospects get thin and you are forced to carve/force a path for growth - due to the sensitivities of others. Some departmental functions do not allow enough opportunities for Scientific growth, specifically in leadership spaces for younger emerging Scientists.
Advice to Management
Recognize and promote young talent. Year on year exceeds/far-exceeds = promote, no excuses. Don't get into arguments of appearance (age, how long it takes others to get promoted, perceptions based on sex/race). Don't worry about how an early but deserved promotion is perceived. Just do it.

Sun Jan 24 2021, Senior Manager,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Current Employee ,Has so much potential to be a great place,0,"The colleagues are generally smart, highly motivated and mission-driven
Good benefits
Solid balance sheet
Highly respected in the industry-lots to learn
Used to have lots of family friendly activities, but not sure what will happen to them after COVID
Management focused on the company stock price and market performance
","-Work-life balance is non-existent. I am literally working all.the.time. Vacations are rarely taken. I have noticed that if my manager does not see me logged on and green on a weekend, the following week I get dumped a bunch of projects since apparently I have “capacity”. We have winter and summer shut downs but I have always worked through them so they are not that helpful
-There is a LOT of micromanaging - this may also be manager/department specific though. But from my experience micromanaging was very commonplace 
-Decision-making is slow and inefficient. This goes back to the several layers of micromanagement. 
-Career progression is tricky. Hard to know how you can really advance to the next level 
-I have had some bad, mean managers. It is disappointing that they think they can treat others in a derogatory manner and the company is allowing such an environment to prevail

Mon Jan 25 2021, Research Manager,,Former Employee ,"True management is lacking, not a good sign",0,"Innovative, challenging work, great opportunity to learn and gain exposure.
","Initially the work culture was fine. As time progressed, the culture became toxic. The individuals that were often times downplaying others, overly political, insecure were getting promoted over those with integrity. True management was lacking. This type of behavior caused many of the most qualified, hardworking, friendly, and enthusiastic team members to leave.
Advice to Management
When you promote individuals who are unprofessional with heavy amounts of unconscious bias, you will see the creativity, motivation, and productivity of your overall team decrease. Treating individuals poorly doesn't go unnoticed by the team, and eventually this will create distrust within the organization. 

My advice is pay attention to the political climate. Confront these issues head on before they trickle down and affect the overall organization.

Thu Oct 08 2020, Senior Engineer,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Current Employee ,It's okay,5,"People are generally nice, approachable, and collaborative; and the compensation and benefits are both good and fairly competitive (pay, healthcare, retirement, childcare, campus / facilities, etc.).

The mission statement of the company is really strong and the products Amgen makes do really change people's lives. It's nice to be a part of that and to hear their stories.
","It's a big, established pharmaceuticals company that is mostly concerned with preserving its market share / cash flow, and that is how the business approaches just about everything. The business tends to sequester and under utilize talent and IP, so innovation and career growth is slow compared to other companies in the industry.

There's also a culture of micromanagement, where leaders tend to not trust their teams and struggle to delegate anything of importance. From what I've seen, this is fairly consistent across departments and up/down the management chain.

Wed Sep 16 2020, Manufacturing Associate,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Current Employee ,Great place to build a solid foundation in GMP manufacturing process,0,"- High salary 
- Good Benefits and two weeks of paid holiday shutdown / year
- 401 K 5% contribution and up to 5% matching 
- High pace and dynamic manufacturing environment which exposes you to multiple different bio processing processes
- Wide range of work and floor operations so everyday is different 
- Helps develop essential business skills
","- Very unprofessional on the floor - major favoritism by FLMs / shift leads
- Major divide between shifts which do not encourage team work and effective collaboration
- Extremely long hour shifts with limited breaks(1 hour lunch break) 
- Stressful work environment outside of the job requirements (mostly politics)
- Strong push back from management and no support for internal lateral or vertical career moves
- Lots of work and limited staff - high call off rates
Advice to Management
Provide more effective training and guidance to FLM team as they have a strong impact on their reports. Managers should uphold and exemplify the Amgen standards. Manufacturing FLMs should maintain professionalism and work on developing the strengths of their direct reports and department team as a whole. High turn around rate due to a lack in the above mentioned basic requirements that management team should have. Remember that manufacturing positions are entry level jobs that provide the company with a great understanding of the potential of early career individuals. In order to hang on to high potential and performing staff management team should really focus on developing and shaping these individuals to further contribute to the Amgen mission as a whole.

Thu Aug 13 2020, Senior Manager,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Former Employee ,General lack of leadership,9,"1) 401(k). 2) Thousand Oaks is a nice area with great weather. 3) Many colleagues (especially those at Director level or lower) are highly science- and evidence-oriented. 4) Many well-meaning colleagues
","1) Management by process rather than reason and inspiration. This company is led by its lawyers and Microsoft Excel. 2) Upper management that's generally out of touch with what's happening on the ground. 3) Management that prefers to punch and delegate down than take responsibility. 4) Some upper management with toxic attitudes who, despite complaints, are never disciplined. However, don't you dare be anything but perfectly professional if you're not an ED or higher. 5) Leadership that says one thing and does another. For example, the top-down push for ""aggressive prioritization"" is juxtaposed by assignment of MORE low priority work and MORE metrics/processes. 6) Development that moves along at a snail's pace despite everyone being overworked due to metrics/processes. 7) A Stalinist corporate environment where people are afraid to speak up. 8) (Department-specific) Lack of appreciation for the people doing the real work on the front lines. 9) (Department-specific) Poor overall compensation by industry standards. 10) An inordinate amount of time updating timelines and budgets for management review. 11) Poor work-life balance; you will be hard-pressed to use your vacation time due to the sheer amount of work and fire drills. Everyone is assigned to multiple programs but expected to be 100% on all of them, another indication that the drive for prioritization is nothing more than empty rhetoric. 12) A deluge of FAKE reviews on Glassdoor via third-party astroturfers to combat downward trajectory in rating. These end up burying the legitimate reviews. Not out of the ordinary, but Amgen is one of the few companies that has hired a PR company to combat negative perceptions on Glassdoor. That should tell you something.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees instead of treating them like a number. The fact that Amgen's stock has performed well due to aggressive, unsustainable cost-cutting does not make the company one that's worthy of respect, nor does it afford it the means to attract and retain top talent. Act on your promises, stop shirking your responsibilities, and work on figuring out ways to improve systemic problems that have plagued the company for the past decade. There are large companies that do it better with fewer resources at their disposal; strive to emulate them.

","Expect to work 12 hours a day or more on the average if you are in any position of responsibility.

a) The organization lacks structure, and support is rarely available to guide the team when it counts. 
b) Management will often de-rail projects within the group by getting involved in the weeds without remediating any of the problems. 
c)Expect to be micromanaged, and if you happen to have any new ideas, the old guard is there to tell you all the reasons why it can’t be done.
d) Management is too busy managing up and does not have time to coach novice team members. I think this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. 
e) There are at countless hours of team meetings that are often disorganized and waste time. 
f) None of the management knows how to facilitate professional usability studies nor moderate a session. 

That is just the tip of the ice iceberg. If you are looking for a place to grow your skills, this is not the place. The real decision-makers are outside consultants 100% of the time. 

It's mostly project management (Project Management 1.5). They are mainly involved in managing usability studies. Most of the work is designing labeling and IFUs (user manuals). The product lineup is also dull if you are interested in a complex system; this is not the place.

Finally, it is essential to note the nature of the device development is not driven by the free market where the best product and design need to be made to compete. They are not in the business of selling devices but drugs. This leads to mediocre products to meet the minimum. Its a shame with all the money they spend.

I can go on and on, take it from me and find another opportunity!
Advice to Management
Focus on growing all employees that are willing to put in 100%, not just the ones that naturally shine. There a lot of talent and sad to see young people not getting the guidance they should to grow.

3. Beautiful Campus - a gorgeous location with a lot of outdoor seating.
","**This is a reflection of my experience of my role and might not be reflected in other departments**

1. Leadership and Management are horrible! Needs a lot of improvement. Whoever hired senior management needs to double-check who they've hired. They hired individuals who are not well-versed when it comes to effectively building strategy or leading a team. 
2. Meetings, Meetings, Meetings: Expect to constantly be in meetings. The running joke is that you have a meeting to discuss scheduling another meeting.
3. They promise work-life balance, but there is none. I worked every weekend for the 3 months that I was there. 
4. It's a constant game of hot potato. Tasks keep being handed off to other individuals and there's no accountability. 
5. Horrible work culture: There is no company-wide events, no bonding, everyone is VERY siloed. 
6. Lots of drama and toxic work environment - a lot of people love to gossip!
7. Narrow-minded - maybe it was just my department; however, they had a very conservative outlook.

","This once great company has been decimated and the staff demoralized by the greedy senior management which has wasted tens of billions of dollars on share buybacks to appease Wall Street and large shareholders. This money would have been better spent on more astute funding of research and superior scientific leaders. The main reason for the share buybacks is to maintain their EPS even though their revenues have been declining for the past few years. In addition, the decimation of the Cambridge site(Neuroscience, HTS, PKDM, Chemistry, and Toxicology) is an abomination and a perfect example of the treachery/greed/shortsightedness of the corrupt bourgeoisie of Thousand Oaks, CA.

Benefits - The benefits program did change and was reduced a bit, it was still one of the best packages available at any company I've worked for
Patients - It's not often that you get to work at a place that has real purpose and when you know that you are contributing to saving and improving lives, there is almost nothing better
Diversity - Amgen has always had an incredibly diverse workforce at all levels even before it was popular
","Career Opportunities Limited - opportunities for career advancement were a bit challenging if one did not want to be a biologist, scientist or technology specialist. It prevented me from being able to explore certain areas any further than where I was, when I left. 
Dependent on Credentials - from a hiring perspective, the prevalent management culture focused disproportionately on degrees and certifications. While those are important there were a number of highly qualified people that were passed over as a result.
Advice to Management
You have generally been committed to diversity at all levels and it shows in hiring and promotions. However, given how good Amgen is traditionally, it might be appropriate to expand the notion of diversity to be more inclusive beyond gender and race. One examples is for recruitment and hiring of non-college degree or certificate only employees and applicants. When I was there I saw a couple of very qualified individuals that were not considered for a position because of they lacked the specific education, but their experience and ability to problem solve was exceptional. Sadly, those people went to other companies and we lost out on their experiences and perspective. Insight and innovation can come from a multitude of places and when diversity is only about race or gender, it limits the ability for new ideas to develop.

Sun Jan 13 2019,Anonymous,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Current Employee ,"The good, the bad, the ugly",8,"Amgen is situated in Thousand Oaks outside of Los Angeles in a very family oriented area. It is surrounded by nature and offers ample opportunity to go hiking in the hills. Lots of nature nearby. But also is at high risk when the wildfires start, like just recently. Many Amgen employees were evacuated from their homes - the fires were that close. The benefits are excellent - vacation and 401k contribution are among the best in the industry and make leaving difficult - there are not many alternatives in the area and , considering some of the cons, the golden handcuffs keep retention rates artificially high. Compensation and bonus, however, have experienced a down trend.
","Not all is well in MedAffairs. I'm hearing about Directors whose cruelty forced employees into leave of absence and others who are entirely out of touch with what's really going on. I'm hearing US MedCom Onc is ridden with a overly biased, managerial anti talent who's been propagated way too long after having experienced a complete turnover of their previous team. Instead of leading a the team to excel with enthusiasm, the turnover has already begun. 

The Amgen performance ratings system is failing its employees. Sub-par ratings need to be filled with quotas whether people deserve it or not. The exact same rating system is currently under fire at Facebook and, as some may know, has been discontinued for good by Mircosoft in 2003 for being a disaster.
Advice to Management
1) It is known (by observation and based on an email to all-staff by no other than Bob) that women make up more than half of the workforce. This is the result of years of systematic hiring and development of females over males. Amgen is not an equal opportunity employer - likely due to attempted overcompensation of other employers shortcoming but entirely misguided. I'm all for equal opportunities for both genders - fix this unfairness and get yourselves back to save grounds legally....

","When asked of HR in an open forum, ""Does the company value work/life balance?"", the HR person had to pause (not a good sign) and finally said, ""Yes, but sometimes you have to fight for it."" In my experience, that's overly optimistic. They treat everyone like wide-eyed military recruits that they can just keep heaping demands upon.

Management is at best inept. Who plans to replace the entire AR/AP system 30 days before the close of the fiscal year, when 90% of the workforce has less than 90 days on the job? That's just dumb. (It was a disaster)

Lots of good people left because of the reorg/move to Tampa, and the folks remaining in California were resentful (perhaps with good reason). They have showed little respect for the new folks in Tampa that they had to train.

The CEO touts the ""open concept"" workspace layout as saving up to 25% on overall real estate costs, which I'm sure it does. It's ironic that a company in the health care space creates an office environment that is sterile - no plants, no pictures, no privacy.

Resources are there (if you're in the right department) and there's a strong focus on safety and improving/automating repetitive tasks. It seems like there's a lot of room for growth if you're talented and ambitious.

I've also found management to be receptive to new ideas. But the most important thing to keep in mind is that every department at Amgen has a completely different culture and feel. Find a job you can excel at and a group/manager you can work well with and you'll thrive here. The former is as important as the latter here.
","Amgen is a company constantly in flux. It seems like there's a re-org every year or two. This has it's pro's and con's but it's often the case that things change before they are fully functional and this is constant.

From what I've gathered from many full-time employees Amgen will put you through a ringer to get a raise and promotions are hard won and are years in the making. This combined with a very lean work force has lead to a lot of attrition lately.

Amgen also loves to hire contract workers. It seems like half the work force is temp. The agencies they use tend to take a lot off the top and disparity in wages for the same job can be quite bad. These agencies also generally have minimal benefits and will lie to you to take a bigger cut of your pie. You really have to be ambitious, network, and often have to move departments to break out of a contract position.

Advice to Management
For departments with great losses of talent where those left are just relentlessly taking on work allow for the possibility for no one to get a partially meets or poor performance rating. Grading on a curve and forcing some staff to receive a poor ratings when they dont deserve it will cause more to leave and also severly lacks integrity. Also eliminate incentives for VPs to come in under budget for staff compensation. Encourage VPs who don't understand or follow Amgen values or encourage staff to understand or follow them to resign. If you mandate your VPs and EDs to treat staff with respect and integrity you might stop the exodus.

","Way to much bureaucracy in senior management. Leaders of departments do not fight for their staff and result in management decisions that affect the work and work-life balance of the staff. Executives are almost completely out of touch with reality, setting up the ""office of the future"" environment and trying to show that they work in that environment along with all the staff when in reality, they set up a locked off section of the newest building where they are completely inaccessible. Leaders are arrogant and will only promote the staff willing to play the corporate BS. It's not the best or hardest working staff who are rewarded or promoted, it's the staff who know how to play the game. Changes to senior management occur far more regularly than the staff and when the changes occur, they bring in new processes which are then done for a couple of years and then changed again when someone else comes in. There are some Sr. Managers to Executive Directors who have survived the layoffs and been with the company for many years and many of these people are cancers to the company. They don't want to make changes to make work more efficient or allow the work-life balance to change. With the company layoffs always looming (almost every year for the past 10 years), most staff feel overworked, underutilized and unappreciated and are just exhausted from trying to meet the deadlines imposed by management who continues to ask for more from their staff with fewer people to get it done.
Advice to Management
Executives and senior leadership need to show that they care about staff and not require staff to produce ""more with less."" There should be a tradeoff of fewer deliverables or longer timelines in trade for loss of employees. Also, they need to get back to the original Amgen values of valuing employees. That is what made people work hard in the past and want to be part of Amgen. Now, the executives have it backwards thinking that people want to be at Amgen and take advantage of it by trying to work everyone to death.

","As a contractor/contingent worker I was marginalized when compared to full time employees, it's part of the company culture. Every contractor is marked as such on all company communications (outlook/skype) so everyone knows who is and is not a contractor, for the purpose of identifying who should not be taken seriously. Amgen doesn't hire contractors in hopes they are good workers and wish to convert them as full time employees. Amgen uses contractors as temporary labor to get fast track or tedious projects completed and then they card discard them so quarterly profits look better. It is also a massively wasteful company when it comes to materials. This review would probably be better if I was hired on, but the group I was in was in the process of downsizing so there was no chance.

","Agree with another review, Amgen used to be good, not anymore. The health insurance plan is worse and worse, premium goes up year by year, 2017 is a 38 dollars more / month compare to 2016. Amgen sent everyone a letter asking you to share more of their cost of the insurance plan---38 dollars more per month of whose salary is between 100,000 to 199,000. Even with this much premium, the deductible is 1500 dollars, without co-pay for anything, meaning you pay full with office visit. I visited doctor once this year,for something small, and paid 340 bucks in full. The insurance plan sucks now, but Amgen used to be good 5 years ago. With the new management team, new CEO, new CFO, Amgen cut off heavily in terms of employee benefits not only health insurance plan, for example, they cut off the expense on Xmas party, yes, you read it right, Amgen doesn't have a company wide Xmas party. 
Promotion here is another big issue, taking my department as an example, there is zero promotion to anyone in the past 10 years.

Wed May 18 2016,N/A,"Thousand Oaks, CA"," in Thousand Oaks, CA","Good company, bad place for technologists",2,"Overall, corporate culture is good. Lots of transparency and communication from management, clear focus on business of serving patients.

- Incredible 401k matching and company automatically contributes 5% for all employees
- Decent health care plans
- Subsidized meals at several cafeterias that serve excellent, healthy food
- Frequent employee focussed corporate events
","The problems start for those of us who are career technologists. Amgen simply does not value this skill, and is intent on outsourcing every possible aspect of technology. This would be ok if they kept competent, motivated technologists on staff to manage / develop the processes and technologies used. 

Too frequently, the only management left are those folks that came from pure technology roles, but many years ago. The result is a technology organization that looks very much like it belongs in the late 1990s.

There are pockets of smaller groups where innovation and leveraging current technologies to achieve greater business value does happen, but the larger ""IS"" organization is not this way. The result is lots of fragmentation, no cohesive strategies to adopt new processes or technologies, and political in-fighting.

To top it off, the greater organizations management is focussed on self-preservation through outsourcing, and have not had the experience that many of us have had that shows how outsourcing requires more discipline and costs than promised.

The other aspect that is quite draining amount of time used by administrative tasks, unproductive meetings and so on. The organization is heavy with analysts and project managers that only know how to communicate via meetings.

Limited growth opportunities due to the above establishment.
Advice to Management
Even though technology is not your core competency, you must learn to treat technology and technologists as assets and not just costs that can be outsourced. Your competition is starting to do this, so it's only a matter of time before this will become a roadblock to your growth.

Please, please start offering the aging IS management early retirement and bring in fresh faces from leaner organizations. That's the only thing that will make Amgen ""the best source for talent""

","99% of the RAC's are very negative and miserable individuals to work with, definitely not a team player, and most definitely toxic to the Amgen company. Per the AC contractors, 99 % of the RAC's has the reputation of the MAFIA AC's. While the AC contractors are working to accomplish all tasks for the day, the RAC's are out playing doing the following.... personal calls, personal errands, yoga classes/gym/walking, visiting eachother, gossiping via email or phone (landline/cellular) to other RAC's about the AC contractors, complaining about their bosses (business/personal lives), their tasks, other colleagues and their colleague tasks, frequent visits to all of the campus restaurants, cafes, coffee stands, direspecting direct reports and scientists, etc. Once the RAC's realize all of the work the AC contractors are accomplishing not only for their boss, but also assisting other colleagues and other RAC's bosses /direct reports/colleagues due to the RAC out on leave (medical, vacation, sick, etc)... the RAC's starts feeling threaten. RAC's starts immediately spreading childish rumors such as the AC contractor are imcompetent of acheiving their tasks. The RAC's not only accomplish their childish rumors, cause friction between all Amgen employees and contractors, they also black ball the AC Contractor from their contract with Amgen and all subsidiaries.

Monitor all RAC's work habits and behaviors, starting with Amgen President AC then proceed down the chain. Amgen is definitely not a team player or a family company as they try to portray.

Its time to clean house and replace the 99% of RAC's with the hard working contractors. Starting with the President since he is incompetent to see or hear with whats going on Amgen's headquarters campus. Once Amgen has cleaned house, the productivity will definitely rise because the moral of the employees (permanent and contractors) wil be up. This also pertains to some of the senior directors and their direct reports. Sometimes the title of the position goes to certain individuals head.

I am very fortunate I assisted a wonderful dept minus the surrounding RAC's, which I have received many compliants from many of my dept colleagues and other depts (Senior Director, Direct-Reports, Scientists, other contractors, temp agencies, etc.). 99% of the RAC's have the mentality they are not disposable because of their seniority with Amgen. If this was any other company, they would be out the front door due to their behavior. Good luck with cleaning house because the RAC's is one BIG click and they watch eachothers backs, this is why they are called the AC Mafia.

Good luck with cleaning house because the RAC's is one BIG click and they watch eachothers backs, this is why they are called the AC Mafia.
