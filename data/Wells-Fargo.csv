Inclusive, friendly and helpful co-workers. Open and transparent management. Lots of opportunity to move around to different teams.

They, truly, seem like they want you to stay with their company throughout your career.
","Due to the prior reputation damage from class-actions and bad media, if/when the company receives additional bad media coverage, customers tend to doubt your credibility and they all try to seek out the 'next big suit'. Also due to this, your work is getting randomly audited and a higher rate than you would see at another financial institution, plus they use such a fine tooth comb. The CEO changed 3 times... within 3 years of working there. They never know how to handle themselves in front of congress, lol. nice job sloan. This specific role in housed in a cubical farm, it is in a beautiful building and the office is gorgeous, but teamwork and verbal communications are nearly impossible due to the layout and the fact that everyone is listening to music or podcasts. You have a production quota in order to evade disciplinary action and poor assessment scores, leading to a minimal raise of >$.15, if anything, and an inability to apply to a new role within the company.
Advice to Management
Quality over quantity. If you want the work do be done, and done correctly (precisely adhering to policy and procedures), lower the production rates. Even if the number is deemed ""easily achievable"", each case is unique, and requires a new set of problems to solve. Sure, once case could have an hour or two worth of production, but the next 5 cases could take upwards of 20-45 minutes to complete, setting you back again. I saw plenty of half-assed cases and large dollar amounts of monetary loss due to the blatant ignorance of others in my department, but the quota needed to be hit, so the loss was taken to the customer AND the bank, while only a coaching opportunity, or small markup, happened to the employee.

Pretty good work life balance- things can get a little stressful at times but if you talk to management or find ways to balance that, it is not too bad

COVID response from company- March 2020 everyone in my location started working from home. It was a surprise to Wells like all other companies however they adjusted really well and provided all the tools necessary to get the job done. They also provided some bonuses to employees as a ""thank you"" which was nice. Overall I would say they handled it better than expected.
","Pay- the pay is not bad however once you have experience they are usually not competitive with the pay and you can get a lot more at other companies. However, they have changed their structure around to be more competitive so unsure what it is now.

I worked at Wells Fargo full-time
Pros
Most coworkers were a pleasure to work with and were truly engaged in moving things forward. Teams could achieve great things if they were allowed to do so.
Cons
Middle management is concerned with the status quo, pleasing their own manager, and will do whatever is necessary to achieve that. Unfortunately, this has had ample media coverage over the last few years. There is little career development or opportunity for advancement, and it seems they would rather promote from outside the firm than cultivate talent within.

There is no incentive to do our best as a teller. I was told by my manager that there were reducing the availability of becoming a banker which lead to me leaving the company because I saw no growth or interest to promote my skill set.

Advice to Management
Rotate your employees Que every now and then. I’ve seen agents near their breaking point because each day they log in them know they’re going to be treated as a human punching bag just for being the first person to answer the call. Talk to your employee’s about their mental health more and check in on them. It’s not an easy job but more can be done to protect the livelihood of your employees

Increase PB1 salary to 45K base and PB2 to 55K base. I have Business Degree and am currently making less money than a teacher. Simply unacceptable from a Fortune 500 company in my market.

Have the same in person training class for business account openings as personal account openings. I sat through a 2 and a 1/2 day in person training course to learn how to open consumer accounts. The level of complexity of opening a business account is 10x higher and the training for it is simply bad. The only way I’ve improved is by receiving numerous CIP errors which has negatively affected my chances for promotion. Not the only one in this position either.

I’ve worked with great people and managers. A very beautiful and diverse culture.
","Sometimes their training is too fast and they will throw you to the wolves and expect you to figure it out by yourself. Sometimes there’s an inappropriate staff to manager ratio when your staff is brand new and have questions about how to do their job. Some departments are very micromanaged. They track your ever move, bathroom break, any time you walk away from your desk, etc. Sometimes goals are unrealistic.

","Your job feel REALLY depends on what type of manager you have.

Documents expire so re-request from borrowers.
Advice to Management
Keep improving the customer experience to be easier and documentation streamlined. Love the technology that aids in that. I know the recession cranks down on underwriting policy to be stricter on documentation requirements and shorter expiration time-frames. Continue to foster management style to assist HLP's in their work and internal emails sent on their behalf to keep files moving - words cannot express how helpful that is to the work load as opposed to merely sending out reports and slapping hands if work is running behind.

Advice to Management
Current CTO talks a lot about going Agile and requiring colocation as part of this strategy, really pushing for it despite COVID likely not going away any time soon. I don't see how this strategy folds in to the CEO's overall cost-cutting initiatives - co-locating and requiring people to show up in the office, when many core locations are already impacted, is likely going to create *more* overhead rather than less in the long run. You will lose good talent through the ""force attrition"" plan and ultimately it will be more inefficient, time-consuming, and costlier to push for this strategy in hopes that people will quit. Maybe you can look at other ways to boost morale during these difficult times while retaining your workforce and encouraging them to work smart. It is not necessary for Agile stand-ups to have to occur in a physical room. This is what we leverage technology for - it works for every other company that has moved *towards* a remote-work model... especially with COVID here to stay.

","The sad part is when I started with another bank which I will leave unnamed they were amazing. Then WF bought us out and that was when I discovered what being in hell was like. They put on the mask like they were changing the company for the good but in reality employees were overworked and underpaid. The turnover was higher then any other company I have worked at. This was due to a combination of things, one was that new hires were not given enough training to feel confident to do the job, others could not keep up with the fast pace, some realized that the sales part of the job was the entire job and was lacking the customer service we were supposed to be giving. Then you have others being termed for mistakes, a lot were probably due to lack of training and or coaching so instead of coaching the employees they normally just termed them. The growth oppt. was very little unless you wanted to go from a teller to a sales position and manager only if another leaves. Don't even consider lead teller because the salary was barely higher then the teller. I recall countless times were entire stores were being termed due to gaming. I also recall countless times were others were sabotaging each other. The leaders acted more like ditators then partners. They would work against you instead of with you and thought that talking to everyone like they were a child would gain respect. The sales goals expected from the employees in every position were so unrealistic and over the top that I can see why so many were not interested in staying. Most would go work at other banks altogether where they could focus on the customer rather than focus on what else they can sell to them. After so many years of seeing this all unfold I felt that being in an environment where everyone around me was so toxic was not healthy. The above things that I shared were not things happening to me, these were observations and when I see things being done over and over and nothing ever changes (even when we have spoke up about it) then sometimes its better to move on. I decided to pursue other ventures. Leaving that company was the biggest weight off of my shoulders ever. I hope that things have gotten better since then.

Some of the benefits are ok.
","Wells Fargo is flailing trying to stay afloat. It is now trying everything it can to get rid of as many US employees in technology as possible and replace them with offshore employees at a fraction of the cost. The pandemic has only made this trend worse.

The experiment started about 7 years ago. Two separate management chains, which only diverge about a level or two below the CEO. Offshore is completely unaccountable to anyone in the US, and their performance is abysmal. US employees take the blame for their mistakes and often have to work extra to fix them.

Wells has always had a bad time managing underperforming employees. Employees who routinely do the jobs of 3 or more people are never promoted or given raises, while those who do nothing climb the ladder quickly. With offshore, that is magnified 10 times. Most offshore managers only care to increase their headcounts, with no regard for actual delivery of work. The project I work on has steadily collapsed under their weight, as every US employee who leaves is replaced by 3 offshore employees who do literally nothing, if you are lucky. I have ""coworkers"" who haven't made a single check-in in over 3 years. They are being promoted.

What we are now seeing is most of the valuable US employees being given negative performance reviews, including those who have literally done the work of 7 people for more than 5 years. Management does not care. They have targets to meet, and they will meet them.

It is abundantly clear the Wells Fargo is moving to a 100% offshore technology model at the expense of its US employees. We get no bonuses. We get no new hires. They get tons of bonuses for no work, and always seem to have new job reqs opening.

It. Is. Hell. Here. I'm literally just waiting until they lay me off so I can get a severance package. I hate every second of this place and cannot wait to leave.

I have been working at Wells Fargo full-time
Pros
Strong corporate structure now in place with focused changes being made to business processes that appear to be for the better. While not always nice to hear there is transparency (or as much as can be expected from up top) and we know what changes are coming for us so plan appropriately if you don’t want to get laid off.
Cons
Lousy raises for all but higher level leaders as most annual increases are 2% for above average performers, 1% for meets and none for less than that. Top performers are eligible for a whopping 3% though so keep those production numbers up and you may be the lucky one on your team to get it! While executives are given lucrative stock options we’re given 1.5% on average.
Advice to Management
Take the same 1% we all get for a raise and no stock bonuses and see how you like it.

Sat Jan 02 2021, Information Security Engineer,,Former Employee ,It was a fun ride while it lasted,1,"The 10+ years at Wells Fargo have been both kind and unkind. Below are the things I enjoyed most.
The work is (mostly) meaningful, and sometimes treated as professionals by management. The people are technically savvy (some even smarter than myself, LOL) and really great to work with. I got along really well with most others, as long as we all focused on the premise that we are working for the same employer trying to accomplish roughly the same goal: building a better Wells Fargo one day at a time and one person at a time.
The pay is really good. Healthcare and related benefits are decent, but could be better. Paid holidays and PTO are satisfactory. Increasing PTO is a good way to keep employees. 401k matching to 6 percent is a gift, as was the ability to obtain an internal loan from the 401k balance was a lifesaver. 
The corporate cell phone and other technical equipment made the work more bearable. Although some years were considered ""tight"" and expenses were minimized or eliminated, having a corporate cell phone to separate personal and business calls makes all the difference. Also, having an option for a MacBook was much better than not allowing them at all (Thank you for merging with Wachovia Bank), and also allowed me to perform calculations and programming much better than the Windows laptops.
I enjoyed the 16 hours paid volunteer time, as well as matched donations to non-profits. Wells Fargo did a great job encouraging volunteerism and giving back to communities.
","As someone with ""disabilities"", there were little accommodations that actually helped me feel like I was being heard, understood, and accepted by my immediate management. Instead, I was treated like a child until I raised my performance level, and was micro-managed for over a year, until laid off in December, 2020.
New upper management have raised several concerns and started workstreams/workgroups that will hopefully add some light at the end of the tunnel, however, it is a little too late for abuses that have already occurred and mindsets already set in stone. Despite the major abuses already discovered (2015 customer account abuses and subsequent regulation changes, 2009 Network Engineer burnout lawsuit, others), similar abuses still continue today due to the legacy Wells Fargo mindset to force employees to work until they burnout and leave, or are displaced at or above age 50. There are a few good managers, and most of the employees are awesome to work with, however, many have left or been pushed out due to lack of following with the marching orders.
There are no real career paths laid out, unless you want to become a political manager and move up the management chain of command. I and many others have suffered under this regime, and I have had little to no ability to move into the career path I really wanted. There was no time because I gave all of my energy and time to my day job, I was not given the opportunity to learn skills to move into the career I wanted to (no solid training courses or programs), and again, no tangible support from managers to help employees to grow.
Some of the new strategies from executive management are good, but several do not make sense for a majority of the technical staff, such as the migration to BYOD. Such strategies make sense for securing Wells Fargo assets, however, leave the employees out to fend for themselves. What about employees who cannot afford the necessary technology to perform their job? What about employees with little knowledge or ability to secure their home network?
Corporate technology that was paid for by Wells Fargo is increasingly watched and bogged down with security software to restrict and log every possible function, even if it is required by the job function or duties. Even my assigned MacBook Pro would turn the fan up and max out on resources on its own, or even crash the OS with no answers for many months.

Has a ton of Mortgage products to assist clients. Technology definitely helps. there is a lot of resources to make your goal and more.... Working with a great manager helps a lot.
Cons
A lot of watch dogs to make sure you are doing your job correctly. They play favorites, If you are a big producer than you will have to kick and scream to get something done. There is no team effort. Everyone is looking to blame you instead of fixing the issue (i.e. Operation vs sales). Spend more time in saying something was done wrong than actually helping. The simplest things can be blown out of proportion. The stress is real
