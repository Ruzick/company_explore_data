Advice to Management
I was employed for 9 months and really struggled with my mental health during that time. Call centers are not for everyone and that’s okay. For the most part my managers and management were accommodating and helped me stay as long as I did. However, I would like to point out that one HR employee in particular completely made everything all the more negative. One day I was taken to her office by a manger on duty so I could talk about the struggles I was having with the job and my mental health. She started off very kind and suddenly flipped the switch on me. I was told “we love a two week notice but if you cannot handle it, just leave. We are in hiring mode right now so it won’t affect us. Just leave.” This makes sense from a business point of view but to say it the way she did really made me feel like just a number which is against the companies values. I was also told by her in the same interaction that “leave on good terms now so that when you get a degree and become somebody you can come back if you’d like.” This really shocked me! I know call center work isn’t rocket science but to imply that a person who does not have a bachelor’s degree is a nobody is just wrong. Some people like myself do have a degree but call center work is all we can get and she just made me feel like I did not matter. Nothing very Joy-ful about that encounter, if you get what I mean! Overall I would recommend this company for it’s benefits and culture and cannot condemn the entire experience because I simply was not able to mentally handle a call center environment or had a terrible interaction with one person in HR. If you can handle and enjoy call center work it’s a pretty decent place to work and opportunities for movement come along semi frequently.

World of difference in treating employees versus contractors.

Loads of playing favorite... in terms of not taking action if that person is your favorite or white skinned or a GE employee.

","1. Synchrony IT is offshoring TOO MANY JOBS. 
2. Way too many hours. Very common to work 40 hrs on dayshift and another 10-20 at night doing changes or change/troubleshooting support. Week after week.
3. I left after 1 year because I hated it so much. Culture not a fit. 
4. No uniformity of strict change management between departments. Eg...Server team changed stuff on the fly with almost no oversight while Network teams had their changes reviewed scrupulously. Then when stuff broke Network team blamed when it was ALWAYS the server(or application) teams at the root of the problem. 
5. If you are an independent thinker youre not going to like working at Synchrony. If you like being blamed for the problems of other teams, and then required to locate the sources of the problems they caused(of course ALWAYS without root access), under the gun when stuff is broken at 5AM and they start business at 6AM, you will love being a Network Engineer at Synchrony.

","Where does one begin. Asks for way too much and the compensation isn't sufficient for what is required. No flexibility. Like most,company extremely top heavy with senior management receiving mid to upper six figure salaries. Concerned more with ranking highest on great places to work rather than BEING a great place to work. Huge disconnect between management and employees who actually do the work. More concerned with ""appearances"" than realities. Moves entire departments from.site to sure with no regard as to how those changes will affect employees. Does not stick to promises made. Follow through horrible. All in all NOT a great place to work unless one is senior manager, ( CEO, VP, SVP,EVP). CEO dumped over 126k in stock collecting over $4 million all the while they were shutting down entire departments. These appears to be common practices with this company. Spends more $$ on handing out tshirts and tumblers and handing out pizza as opposed to simply paying employees a living wage and bragging about how they're a $6 billion dollar company. Easy to be that when senior execs only people enjoying huge salaries. Was not a pleasant experience to work there at all.

Stop paying execs so much money to stay in meeting after meeting continuously and pay the actual people who do the work.

Top management seems to try something new, but middle level they still have old GE mentality and they do not foster good culture. Everyone afraid of failure, how does innovation comes from that? Every one is ready to point at if something goes wrong even before fixing it.

Any positive reviews were written by management to make it look like working here is great. 

When the company employees receive the ""Great Places To Work"" email survey, management forces the employees to take the survey together as a group with the managers to ensure the answers are positive.
","• If you are one minute late, you will not meet schedule adherence and will be marked negatively.

• If you have to go into Personal Aux to go use the bathroom, because you’ve been holding your pee and it’s still an hour until your next break, you will not meet schedule adherence and will be marked negatively.

• If you were about to log out to go to break, lunch or leave for the day and you get the beep indicating a caller is on the line and the call gets complicated and runs over, you have to stay and assist no matter how long it takes and no matter how it may negatively impact your schedule adherence and/or your personal schedule.

• If you have something come up unexpected, and you have personal business hours but your “unexpected occurrence” isn’t on Synchrony’s approved list of items, then you can’t use your Personal Business time.

• If you have a family emergency and you’re on the floor/taking calls, your loved ones cannot get a hold of you. You’ll have to wait until your break, lunch and/or end of shift before you can speak with your family. No cell phones are allowed while you're at your desk taking calls.

• All your calls are recorded and you're being graded based on software that is not 100% reliable. Workstation (the software/program) glitches, shuts down, freezes and overall does not always perform the way it’s supposed to and yet the call center associates metrics and jobs are dependent upon it. If something’s off with Workstation and it messes up the call center associate, the call center associate is in jeopardy vs. management looking further into Workstation and what may be wrong with it. 

• Management shares that a Customer Service Representative is not here to help customers but to get them off the phone as quickly as possible. We are not here to help but to do what we can to ensure they don’t call again.

• Your call time is supposed to be 3 mins or less per call. Going through training doesn’t truly represent what will happen on the floor. It’s understood that you can’t train on every single item that may occur but being told that you’ll mainly be taking payments and waiving late fees is false. Most people call because something out of the norm is going on and they need help. So most calls are not simple which means your call time will typically be long. 

• Important updates that involve changes in processes are sent via email and then the Customer Service Representative is expected to read these communications and keep up to date while continuing to take calls and always be up to date on what’s changed. Sometimes the changes are a little complex and additional training would be beneficial. Sometimes there’s off phone training but most of the times there’s not. 

• Taking verbal abuse from customers and having to remain calm and being forced to read from a script or potentially face termination if you allow your feelings (that are rightly felt when someone is treating you like dirt) to
get the best of the situation. 

• Customer Service Reps are expected to be IT experts but are not paid extra for it. Each client should have a Digital Tech team but they don't. Customer Service Reps are supposed to have low call times and yet when someone calls and needs someone to hold their hand as they try to register their card, or set up Auto Pay, or is having overall IT related issues with an App or with getting into their account…the Customer Service Representative is stuck on the call until the customer gets access. You cannot have low call times and help people with IT and online/eservice matters. 

• Dealing with Multi Client Schedule Bid process. Upon being hired, you don’t really get to pick a schedule that truly works for you; you have to select from what’s available. When you get that schedule, it is not permanent. During the Multi-Client Schedule Bid time, every person is ranked and depending on your rank order, you are scheduled to select from an entire new list of schedules (your current schedule may not be on the new schedule bid list) and by the time you get to select, what’s left may not work for you. If you have to make it work, you’ll have to rearrange your childcare, any scheduled doctor’s appointments, etc. If you can’t make it work, you have to resign and it’s a great way for them not to have to
perform layoffs and potentially be on the line for any earned unemployment benefits.

There's a quote that reads, ""Treat your employees the way you want them to treat your customers."" Management needs to put this in practice as it relates to how they treat their Customer Service Representative employees. 

Customer Service Representatives are the face of the company and take all manner of abuse from customers every single day. Stop treating your Customer Service Representatives like little children who can't be trusted. Start showing your Customer Service Representatives respect and treat them like trusted adults.

","The interview process at Synchrony is an elaborate ruse to promote a diverse workforce. We focus so much on inclusiveness because it is only accolade Synchrony is continually recognized for. It is a counter-intuitive practice, in that some certainly deserve and are qualified to be in the position that they are in, but they did not get to that position based off value. The interview process itself remains completely unchanged, even after we have claimed to have fixed it; in whole it is a disengaged, robotic charade. Synchrony allows initiatives to be in place to promote people based on diversity, not merit. 

Synchrony’s agenda to promote for diversity vs. competence will inevitably cause more harm than good. Putting lesser-qualified candidates in positions that could be better performed by someone else causes continuous management issues and a lack of faith in senior leadership. There are numerous studies detailing how it is impossible to hire both for competency and diversity initiatives concurrently, so the fact that Synchrony acts as if both are in place highlights our obliviousness. 

This is the root cause of 95% of our problems here, yet we choose to continue full-steam ahead with this hushed initiative. I’m not sure if senior leadership thinks we are too thoughtless to realize what is actually happening or afraid to say so, but that is not the case. Everyone knows we are promoting under qualified minorities over those better suited for jobs. 

I’m certain nothing will be done to improve our interview process because Synchrony cares more about appearing successful than setting themselves up for success. You would think that after losing our biggest client after a decade’s long relationship we would realize our error. Walmart chose to leave us because we are years behind on technological advances and have exemplified a stagnancy to change. How do we ever expect to get ahead if we continue this same path of complacency and ignorance?

My healthcare deductible was $800 and even before it was met, my policy paid for most of my care. The pay is decent. They used to do monthly bonuses but that went away at the beginning of 2019. They averaged your 2018 bonuses and added that into your base pay. So instead of making $15.50, my pay bumped to $17.50/hr. Onsite gym, cafeteria, marketplace, break rooms, vending machines, etc. You have to have a badge to get into the building so I felt safe while at work. Management is nice and approachable. Ample time off. So many committees to join. You can tell they actually care about your personal growth. Tuition reimbursement.
","It’s a call center, so the work is very dull and repetitive. You will deal with unhappy customers on a daily basis. As an account manager, part of my job was to take the escalated calls. 

This is more of my personal experience, but the sick time policy needs to be changed. You get paid for sick days, but there are certain “triggers” (hours) that you hit and that results in corrective action. I get sick a lot, so I was put on corrective action quite a few times for it. I wish I could have the option to take unpaid sick time and not get in trouble for it. 

Synchrony has been rated a Great Place to Work for the past couple of years and it’s true, but that initiative is pushed on us too much. Around the time of year that we take the survey it’s all you hear about from management.

invest more in the entry level-exempt roles. The focus of AVP+ jobs means current employees are left stuck in a job or thinking about leaving the company so they can grow. Think about offering a better compensation then the 50 cent increases per level for the non-exempts. Especially when in the past there were dollars difference in levels to encourage internal growth. The biggest takeaway is that you have deemed 11+ years of service to be worth 8 cents more an hour compared to someone who has been with the company 5 years.

","EXTREMELY LOW PAY! I'm not sure what all of these other reviewers are talking about, but 13.25 an hour is not decent pay. It is insulting pay for the amount of stress their customer engagement specialists (aka call center employees) have to deal with. They give ""bonuses"" sure, but they are only $25 for each metric, which can total about $200 max. That is laughable. I have been in call centers where the calls were not even CLOSE to as stressful as these calls are and they bonused they employees out with over a thousand dollars a month (and yes it was a private company-non-collection call center). They ask for too much and offer too little in return. I cannot even enjoy the employee engagement activities because I think how all of the money they spend to look good could actually go to paying their people better. Also, dont even think about getting a promotion unless you are willing to jump through hoops or possible move your entire family across country.

","1. Work-life balance is not balanced within the company. A lot of people coast until they can get into a central function because the client-facing jobs (revenue-generating) tend to be stressful.

Tue Sep 04 2018,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Business Leadership Program,6,"The nice thing about BLP was the the amount of capital they invested into recent college grads to enhance technical skills for certain areas (I.e financial modeling courses, coding courses, sales force trainings.) In addition, you did have high more exposure to senior leaders, but at the end of the day that access didn’t really add that much additional take way value to the program. Yes, the CFO or CCO knew who you were, but that didn’t necessarily help you on program. Could be extremely beneficial if you stay at SYF for a long period of time.
","BLPs toward the end of the program aren’t paid fairly or based truly on Merit/ level of work/ responsibility post program. As someone who went through the program and received the highest merit rankings, the difference between you and an average performing BLP is just a few hundred dollars in total pay at the end. Doesn’t incentivize a BLP to stay. The program management also lacks transparency and often waits until last minute to explain very important details that affect you in a big way ( I.e. they tell you a month before you move across the country when they’ve known for the last 3 that you’re doing it.... just to be fair to everyone in program rather than rational). This lack of urgency is very frustrating when trying to find housing for each rotation.

Finally, industry isn’t the most appealing outside of the IT function.

Just be more direct and upfront with the program. I always felt like everything the program did was a big smoke and mirrors show/ very secretive....

For the last 3 or 4 years 24/7 they are running recruitment ads on broadcast TV in Dayton Ohio to stem the lost due to attrition.
They hire it $12 an hour that's about half of what a living wage is.
After 18 years I left a $26.40 an hour. That sounds pretty good but you have to go through 18 years of eating poop to get there.
Like most companies HR is there only to protect the companies interest and management,... nothing else.

","After being here for over 2 years I had seen the beginning, and the end of a great team. 
Leadership inside of CareCredit (PDS) is horrendous. The department is struggling trying to find it's sales identity. A failing QA process leads to frustrated employees, and unnecessary pressures of calls and talk time ""production"". The management team has yet to align itself with proper strategy, and execution to make money, and be a great place to work for it's employees. The leaders will beat you into submission or make you leave on your own accord. Being on this inside sales team in Synchrony comes with career killing consequences of personal branding. 
BUT THEY ARE ABLE to change for the better of their team!! Just unwilling, and that is why I no longer work here. This job is the highest paid outbound customer service role you can find.

If it's a call center, just say it and let the people make amazing relationships with their offices.

The company strives for great customer experiences. Great in-depth training when you start. I've always had great managers and peers. You are provided with everything to do your job well. Several opportunities to Grow -- leadership programs, projects, Affinity groups, free training workshops, plus tuition reimbursement. 

There is a great level of transparency in management and senior leaders. We've had a lot of organizational changes when Synchrony separated from GE and all the expectations of your role in the company is always clear.

Solid pay for entry level jobs with opportunites for advancement and with it being an international company you have the chance to relocate if you'd want. Top benefits with insurance (health insurance dental and vision). 2 weeks off and 12 additional floating days to start plus illness and business time off allotments. Sites have gyms or you can get fitness reimbursement. Healthy commitments like healthy foods in cafeteria sports activities like softball, and groups like weight watchers are there to help. 

Depending on your department there are a lot of ways to get recognized for working hard. Plus many on the phone roles are bonus eligible paid out monthly.
","Working on the phones can be tough. It's easy to feel overwhelmed or stressed. Sometimes managers seem nonchalant to resolve issues you are seeing or having. It's not uncommon to have miscommunication especially between other offices. It takes a lot of dedication to get the skills needed to succeed or find a spot thats a good fit for you. Pay is better for newly hired associated than more seniored associates who were overlooked at the last pay raise. It also seems people can skid by the rules and there are no consequences which can bring down morale. Inconsistency to the rules can cause tension in the workplace from time to time.

 As a customer service rep, you have a decent level of autonomy to fix and resolve problems for customers and correct errors or provide some financial recompense for inconvenience or errors, had to escalate calls maybe once every other day. 

Standards are clear and consistent. . Relatively good about time off if asked for early enough in advance. Relatively relaxed dress code, unless management is visiting, ie public school dress code, nothing offensive or torn.

","You'll be dealing with phone customers for 8-10 hrs a day (over 40hr week overtime pay, not mandatory) and people are usually not calling because its a good day. 

The work can be rather boring and rote. 
Staffing levels vary as new accounts come on or new corporate customers. 
Some days it slow and people have the opportunity(by choice) to go home early, other days it's back to back calls. The longer you're there the more account types you handle,

You have scheduled breaks for lunch and two other times during a shift (bathroom at will of course), so if you don't like sitting, can be frustrating. (encouraged and expected to take breaks at scheduled times as part of metrics)
Advice to Management
Keep providing the chance for advancement for good employees, would have convinced me to stay if not for different life direction. The benefits especially medical is a huge plus. Having managers that coach and work with people helps you retain the good ones. The collaboration and congeniality of the departments and people was pretty great, and the ability to train up to a new job with better pay is a definitive incentive to excel.

Fri Jul 01 2016,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Not a place for young professionals,10,"- Generous graduate tuition reimbursement
- Collaborative working environment depending on the site
- Flexible hours and opportunity to work from home depending on your manager
","- This company is positioning itself as a technology and analytics leader, but in fact it's a dinosaur in both regards. It's only now starting to transition to the IT environments that had been already implemented several years ago at other fin tech companies.
- The compensation is poor and well below the market. There is a raise threshold when you go from one role to the next, regardless of whether you were low balled in the first place and are underpaid in comparison to your peers. I don't see the analytics talent sticking around for very long, as the millennials have a low threshold for boredom ie operational work and data clean up. You won't find machine learning, dynamic simulations or any interesting analytics projects here.
- IT support is poor
- Some employees have been there for decades and have no motivation to advance their skill set even when it comes to basic computer skills
- Senior leadership is still holding on to their GE history and is completely out of touch with reality on how to retain and grow young professionals
- Poor work life balance as some clients and the respective client teams expect you to be on available on weekends and during after-hours or to stay connected during your vacation time
- Poor relocation options
- It's a ""relationships company"" or rather ""how far you get depends on who you know""

Then given new company to learn in 1 day put on phones to take calls the next day! Management asks for feedback but then gets rude and defensive when told your feelings. Ask for you to do review but has a lady question you and fill it out for you not really a review then. Feedback is digitally tracked on other supposed review of your trainers. There is a creepy guy who antagonizes several people daily who corporate should be aware of who comes in and out of the training classes all day long. Incidents are not handled fairly a young lady was confronted in hallway by another in front of several witnesses but none of them called on for their statements but the accosted young girl was reprimanded and treated like the aggressor. The people who handled the situation were same race as the woman who aggressor. They spoke with her first not the young lady who was verbally attacked.

Tue May 17 2016,N/A,, ,World-class spinoff from a world-class company,2,"Great senior leadership and management when it was under GE Capital. Many of the senior leaders remain, so I'd assume that the GE culture has carried over. There's really a culture of leadership and professional development here with Leadership 360's and leadership training. HR and your managers often have proactive discussions with you when it comes to career development. Obviously, you still have to drive your own career, but they certainly provide the resources, training and assuming that you perform well, the opportunities, as well. There's an emphasis on rounding out your skill sets to position you for ""that next job.""

Other pros:
1) Well-developed business processes in place, such as the 1 and 3-year strategic planning reviews.
2) Great sense of camaraderie across the functions. Everyone is generally willing to help and support you. It feels like an army marching to the beat of the same drum. 
3) The Marketing function really drives the bus here, but there are healthy debates with the other functions (Risk, Finance, Legal, etc.)
4) Compensation is competitive. Health insurance could've been better.
5) Good work-life balance. Ability to work from home occasionally.
","1) Since the company is so mature, they are not always the first to innovate, but once they put their resources behind an initiative, they can play catch-up quickly. 
2) Be prepared to possibly move every few years in order to move ahead in your career. Synchrony's approach of having teams co-located with their clients means that there are many smaller teams scattered across the country. Additionally, there are major HQ offices and centers of excellence in Connecticut, Ohio, Georgia and Illinois.

","Everything else. I worked for Synchrony when it was still GE Financial from 2007-2011. It was the worst 4 years of my life. I'm not sure now why I tried to hard to get the job. They jerked me around from the start. I had temped there for one day years prior and passed. So when I took the test for the job (which was a joke) they had to do additional processing or some garbage and it took them almost 2 months to get back to me with my results. I should have taken that as a sign from the start.

It was great at first. Great benefits, decent entry pay for someone with only an Associates Degree, a second shift schedule that didn't make me get up early. I loved my first supervisor. But then shift bid happened and I was moved to a new supervisor who was a jerk. I started getting write ups because my call handle times were too long. I was told I ""helped too much"". I'm sorry, but I thought customer service was about resolving the customer's issues? Not there! I had 10 years of customer service experience and an AS degree in Business Administration before I set foot in there, but they didn't care. They want you to get the customer off the phone as quick as possible. It's not about helping, it's about handling the most calls. My quality scores were PERFECT, but I took too long. I eventually transferred to Store so my handle time went down. Then I got sick, and things really went downhill. They were not at all flexible in letting me take sick time that I had. I was written up for BEING IN THE HOSPITAL. When I had to be off work for surgery I had to jump through a million hoops to have my disability leave approved and ultimately someone at their disability center who wasn't even a doctor made the determination to allow me time off, not my doctor. It was a joke. I was eventually fired. Hilarious, since I was one of the few on my team that actually did the job - you know, answering the required number of calls, getting the required quality score, and helping the customer.

They take awesome care of you and really want to see you succeed. It is a fast-track to higher leadership roles in the company. There is unbelievable exposure to senior management, most assignment leaders are at VP level or higher. We had dinner with the CEO and other senior leaders on the first night. People at all levels of the company are approachable and friendly. 

There are lots of opportunities for travel and explore different parts of the business. Rotations are every 8 months and you can pretty much go anywhere in the US to explore the different parts of the business. Relocation benefits are generous. 

Salary and benefits are extremely good, especially for a first job out of college. I haven't heard of any salaries for first jobs which are as generous as Synchrony. 

It seems like they took the best of the GE leadership programs and even made it better. I see this program getting more and more competitive in upcoming years, but so far it's been great! They really want to see you succeed and the program is well respected throughout the company.
","Since it's a new program there are a few kinks still being worked out- but it's only going to improve in upcoming years. Because the company is so diverse and spread out throughout the country, communication can take extra effort - meetings are usually done over the phone and not in person.

Sun Oct 18 2015, Fraud Specialist,"Phoenix, AZ",Former Employee ,Disengage,14,"I don't work there anymore and I'm thankful that my days at SynBnk are over. That is the best thing about this employer. I'm so glad I don't have to go back, as it was one of the worst experiences of my entire life (and I've been through some very difficult times). 

I have been meaning to write this review for a very long time, but just thinking about SynBnk put me in a bad mood. I'd get angry and upset all over again while trying to write about that horrible place. I'm at a wonderful job now and enough time has passed that I can finally write this. If it convinces even one person to NOT apply for a job with SynBnk, then it's worth it!
","There are many reasons why the turnover rate at this place is so high. There are back to back training classes, yet rows upon rows of empty desks. Some people quit during training, once they realize what a horrible place they've signed up with. 

Every day on local talk radio, there's an ad played regarding open positions at SynBnk and I know it means they're still understaffed. I smile every time I hear it because I know I'm driving to a job that I love, and NOT to SynBnk. 

I will list some specific cons, but I'm only scratching the surface here.

*Employees are made to feel that they are constantly on the verge of being fired, no matter how good they are at the job. Even ""star"" employees will up and rage quit in the middle of the day.

*Favoritism is a problem. Suddenly there's new positions custom-created for a select few people.

*Disciplinary action is constantly taken against people for the dumbest of reasons. Each disciplinary action sticks with you for ONE ENTIRE YEAR, no matter how insignificant the ""violation"" was. 

*There is no room for cutting anyone some slack, no matter what the circumstances were. It doesn't matter if you or your child had an emergency; the rules are the RULES and everyone must abide by them. 

*Examples of things people were disciplined for, that I know of: using the f-word while on lunch break, across the street while talking to a friend in a casual conversation, where no customers could've overheard; being 1 minute late clocking in or out; using your sick day benefit for what they deem is too many times even though you have enough hours; etc.

*Policies are explained in the most vague way possible. If you ask for clarification, you'll find that different co-workers are given different answers from different managers. Yet, you are held responsible for following all the policies and it's your fault if you interpreted the written guidelines differently than how the person punishing you saw them.

*When a new process or procedure or anything comes out, they're fond of tacking this phrase to the end of it: ""failure to comply will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination."" Am I just there to be punished, or am I at work??!!

*You are micro-manged to death.

*You are not treated like an adult, but as a misbehaving child 

*You have to stick to corporate-approved scripts while on calls, and some of them contain lies.

*Not only does management treat employees horrible, but the company as a whole treats customers horrible. You only needs to look at BBB's site to see proof of what I'm talking about.

*Even if logical reason led you to believe that the person on the phone was an ID thief, you were not allowed to act based on evidence or your own thinking skills. Rather, you had to ""follow the process."" If the ID thief could pass the screening tests, then they could get away with doing whatever they wanted to do. 

*""Following the process"" per company rules and regulations could leave actual cardholders stranded,or repeatedly unable to use their cards despite making the same kinds of purchases at the same kinds of merchants. 

*Having to participate in treating customers so poorly (or else I'd get fired) HONESTLY had me in tears after work some days. 

*Every negative comment I've read about SynBnk on Glassdoor is 100% true. I still feel I've listed the bare minimum. Basically, avoid this place like the plague.

Threats, disciplinary action, and unrealistic goals do not make employees accountable or harder workers: they cause them to become your ex-employees.

Management - self-absorbed that any recommendations outside of their own are foreign territory. 

Lack of Work Life Balance - unusual push to just be in the office, for ""face time"".

Lack of recognition - efforts go unnoticed unless you're a rocket scientist and even that might just be mediocre for this place. 

Racism aka bureaucracy (shocking as it can be in 2015) - didn't think this would make the list, but it sure does. What they (management) do not know is the creation of all their 'networks' disintegrates teams.

","Managers don't know anything and hold employees accountable . Quality assurance is brutal they will fail you on a good call for the smallest thing . Forget bonuses because of the quality assurance team. You can work your butt off but if the quality team gives you a zero you can hang it up for the month. Which a zero could be something as simple as not moving a telephone number or coding something wrong . They preach this is how you learn !!!! But when you are put on a write up they have no flexibility on that ? All write ups stick with you for a year reguarless of how mild the situation is . Managers stand around and have meetings allday. No weekends off no weekend rotation, 2 months to request a sat off in advance or more. Department should be mon-fri but isn't because of unecessary work load . Saturdays you are pretty much cleaning up the store associates messes on applications allday (nothing frd related ).No flexibility in days off most split days no two consecutive days off . Shotgun meetings this needs to be done immeadiatley no time to figure it out . 

 No growth within the company whatso ever ! Also they don't consider that most of there clients are elderly or broken english speakers which makes the job more difficult. Phone system isn't very clear because they monitor every call you take. You get 12 evaluations per month which is overkill most banks only do four to six on a agent. Benefits are not that good you have to meet a $800m deductable most is $ 500 before paying out 80%. You have a 500 balance on a wage card but that still leave $ 300 to pay out . Then what kills me when you go to the doctor its not automatically deducted you have to submit a request ? Very High turnover rate in the department and noone cares. Not sure how the company was when it was GE but I wish I had of known better. Very strict rules no flexibility whatsoever on anything so just know that .

Come up with a 3 part Grading scale like most banks so that it would be less personal.

The Fraud department is a revolving door a training class every 6 weeks . The guy thats over that department is nice and he tries but his hands are tied I just really feel bad for him. I would really think about it before considering a long term future here . Most agents last one year max and thats a super good one . Stop with the constant changes every month and holding your employees accountable for them immeadiatley. Increase the pay to a decent wage for the expectations you guys hold people too. Other banks would have changes ever 6 months to a year . Synchrony Financial has no idea what they want to do every month its different .

","-If you are under the age of 45 walk away. They can use the brand name of their old parent company for another three years to sucker in new grads and they will. This company recently spun off and they're a bit of a mess. 

-Understaffed and at the same time bloated with employees who coasted through when this company was with GE. The best GE employees (there were a lot of them) bailed out before this company split away. Synchrony legacy employees haven't bothered to further their education in decades. It's going to show now that they have to ramp up IT project work/ finance platforms and can't rely on their parent company anymore for brand name and support. The IT platforms they do have are archaic, it will stay this way because legacy employees jobs depend on them not having to learn new languages/ systems

-Trying to be hip and have a startup atmosphere. (In a patronizing and ham-handed attempt to attract ""millennials"" they quickly set up an ""innovation station"" complete with an indoor putting green) now that they desperately need younger people- don't fall for it, the support and manpower just isn't there and they backed the wrong horse when it's comes to mobile payment platforms

-Most employees are generally nice but have zero candor, creativity, and judgement. They honestly just want to coast through the day and go home to their families. For a younger person eager to role up their sleeves and build something this is crushing. For a company recently gone public, it will really slow them down. 

-They try to position themselves as an analytics and marketing company, at the end of the day they are still a low tier credit card company that targets people with the lowest credit quality relative to other lenders. Their collection methods and platforms give them terrible reputation and it shows even more without the GE brand name

Thu Aug 14 2014, Senior Professional,"Stamford, CT",Current Employee ,Avoid this Company,13,"Stable employer (owned by GE), desktop software products are fairly current for a big company, and they attempt to instill need for integrity in employees. Difficult environment to be a renegade - mostly decision by committee. Ability to work from home occasionally. Ability to transfer between GE divisions. Most employees seem competent - slackers are hard to find. Benefits are decent. New innovation workstation areas are very appealing. Margaret Keane - the CEO - is a terrific lady, very approachable, down-to-earth, common sense and intelligent thinker. Most of CEO's direct reports also seem like great, competent leaders. (It's that next layer down that causes all the problems!)
","Unbelievably under-staffed -- most people seem very overworked and doing the job of 8-10 people. Very stiff, unfriendly and unnecessarily competitive corporate culture with lots of bad managers. The pay is too low for Stamford area. No one seems to take real vacations (without work) and the lunch hour is also a foreign concept. Lots of arrogant, type A personalities who seem to enjoy making other people's lives difficult. Have to put up with lots of complaining when working with project teams, including complaining from people who think certain types of work is beneath them. Many of the internal processes are so complicated and inefficient that the GE parent started a ""Keep It Simple"" movement (which doesn't seem to be having any effect). The North Stamford location is very inconvenient and unprofessional feeling - not close to the train station and situated in the middle of a housing area with absolutely no restaurants, no shops, not even a CVS or McDonalds nearby. There are lots of GE-life-ers and they seem to be the only ones who stay long term. Turnover of non-GE people is very high.
Advice to Management
Hire enough people to get the job done or adjust your expectations. Allow people to take real vacations (without work) and allow for a real lunch hour (without work). Find a better HQ location than North Stamford. Get rid of the bad managers and stop cow-towing to the GE-life-ers -- they are generally the least talented and most confrontational people on the teams anyway. Pay more competitive salaries for the Stamford area.

Both of these can be forgotten if you are happy and I believe Synchrony will do that.
