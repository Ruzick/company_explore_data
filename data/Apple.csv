If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve. Sick of hearing the lies.

- sensitive; every day I work in fear because I never know what new extreme left policy they utilize will trigger false accusations 
- the need to appease identitarian extremists is so great I am regularly and falsely accused of discrimination
- huge lack of diversity. Everyone looks different, but thinks the same. It is kind of like the stepford wives. Lots of smiles and niceness, just don’t mention anything politically moderate or right leaning.
- because of all of the above, it isn’t uncommon to see employees emotionally and verbally abuse other employees for taking a stand for something that doesn’t align with identitarian intersectional ideology.
Advice to Management
Create a DNA for conservatives. Apple says they are “for everybody” in their values but fail miserably for people who are more conservative leaning. There have been so many people I’ve known who would say, “I am just using this place” or “this place will never accept me.” Lots of talent is lost in this manner, and having people who have been successful yet conservative at Apple guide you through understanding and navigating the terrain will help keep some talent. Though, because of the above cons, I seriously doubt Apple could find any leaders who are either conservative or will admit to being so.

Advice to Management
You could have 100 good calls in a row and as soon as you get one bad call, management is all over you. They give zero support to employees and automatically assume you did something wrong, even when people are goign to rate you bad no matter what. Management has a mentality that they ""know better"" so they think anytime you have a bad call, that if they were on the line it would have been a 'good' call, which is often not the case.

My immediate reporting manager was amazing as was my store manager/HR. Most of the time sales were easy.
","INADEQUATE TRAINING. I was someone who started without an abundance of tech knowledge. My team taught me something new every day, all day. Normally a good thing but not great when the store is swamped (which frequently happens) and you're essentially on your own. Still retail, Same challenges with any other retail position: Unrealistic hours (cant exactly be helped. Weekends and nights), Not enough Pay to scrape by (On the higher side of retail though.) ""Unspoken"" sales/business intro/apple accessory + service quotas. Zero incentive to achieve a top position in any previously mentioned categories, aside from recognition. Any advancement WILL require some outside education. Apple/ Store sponsorship does exist to some varying degree. Apple corporate and Apple retail are two ENTIRELY different entities. Just because an employee enters the Apple ""eco-system"" at a base level doesn't mean that the employee may have a better chance of securing a corporate career, even with an adequate curriculum vitae and professional experience. Experiences seem like more of a way to ""tease"" employees rather than show a glimpse of a future career.
Advice to Management
Hit or miss. Mainly issues at corporate levels rather than direct store issues. Management styles shouldn't vary wildly manager to manager. Please keep employees up to speed and help them use outside sources to train. ""Hello"" and training modules exist but these tools are useless without ample time to actually study the material. Get some hands on physical basics (computer internals), new phones to practice basic iOS diagnostics/resets. SET ADEQUATE time aside for new hires to learn, I cannot stress this enough.

Doesn't Recommend
I worked at Apple full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
At times it can be fun. You will most likely end up working with some really intelligent and great people. The company strives to build comradery within each retail location and if you happen to be working at a store other than home store, you will find that for the most part, the culture is the same. You really can build some great friendships.
Cons
The training is laughable. While the topic is always a source of discussion, the time allotted to learn and study is minimal and is usually plagued with interruptions. Management is top heavy and like any workplace, managers can be ego driven. It's a definite paradox in that the company mandates ""Daily Downloads"". For the most part these are drink the koolaid and cheer leading sessions and you will stand out if you don't participate. Often a lead or a manager will go over what was in a company made video that was distributed to retail locations as a means of motivation. You will soon learn that what is stated in the videos is often not practiced in your store... It can be a toxic and co-dependent nightmare depending on your management team (like any workplace) but at the very the least you will be trying to figure out why there are so many managers per store. The company likes to tell you that Apple retail store are more than retail... The pay structure is often held up to/based on retail pay, but there is a lot to learn and processes and products are constantly changing. You are graded on every single transaction via customer feedback. You will be encouraged and possibly singled out if you do not share enough about yourself with your co-workers and your managers. To summarize, it's hit and miss and more overwhelming instead of engaging. You most likely will not learn as much as you would like to unless you are willing to learn outside of your paid time and the pay, well, you'll probably fall into the category of living pay check to pay check. If you want to really use your mind and have an engaging learning environment I suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, there is ALWAYS a lot of hype about working for Apple and how difficult it is to get a job there and how Cinderella like of a place it is to work at... By the end of your on boarding they will have convinced you that you are part of an elite group. Take it however you want to... One of the big questions I think a lot of people have is if you can get a corporate job if you get hired for a retail position. The answer: yes, but like any other workplace you will need to be a savvy political player.

• No appreciation at all. (not talking about money here. talking about ""thank you"")
• Bad work environment. (too much tension)
• They did not provide a prayer room form me (as I am Muslim) 
• no teamwork - you are not appreciated if you tried to help a member of your team.

Sat Jan 23 2021, Electrical Engineer,"Cupertino, CA",Former Employee ,Indian Managers Will ONLY Hire Other Indians,0,"Cutting edge technology, located in the heart of Silicon Valley
","If you are not Indian, your days are numbered. Unfair BIAS against non-Indian employees.
Advice to Management
The demographics of Apple are shifting, with 95% plus of engineers being of Indian descent. If a company in Silicon Valley were to hire 95% Caucasians, this would be unacceptable, of course. But if an equal percentage of Indians takes over a company, oh well, this makes the company ""Diverse"", right? At Apple, Indian managers have successfully taken over the company (at least in the fields of IT, engineering and computer software). They want to reserve the rich, highly-coveted Silicon Valley Lifestyle for themselves, their relatives, and people of their own Caste who are stuck back at home in Tamil Nadu or some other Southern province. They implicitly believe that native-born Americans are undeserving of this privilege. The Indian managers seek to enforce this policy by upholding a double standard: the bar is very low when they are helping their own to climb the corporate ladder, but the bar raises to an impossibly high level when it comes to native-born American citizens. They see nothing wrong with helping their under-qualified uncles, aunts and cousins to get jobs, while throwing native-born Americans under the bus. If you are not Indian, you don't stand a chance. Apple management has allowed this to happen, they have enabled a system that is extremely discriminatory against Americans, yet they want Americans to purchase their products. But if Apple only wants to hire Indian, then perhaps only Indians should buy their iPhones and iPads, and Americans should think Android instead. If this practice of dismissing extremely qualified and talented American engineers to make room for inferior Indian engineers from specific desired Castes and regions (Tamil Nadu), Apple is going to lose its marketplace lead and engage in a slow (or possibly more rapid) decline. This problem has already gotten way, way out of hand. The time is ripe for corrective action to be taken (either by Apple itself, or if not, then by means of government intervention). NOTHING is diverse about an engineering staff that is 95% South Indian, where access to a job is 100% controlled by a biased, ignorant manager who uses lack of 'skills' and 'fit' as a pretext to weed out employees who have undesirable ethnic backgrounds.

You get to work with a lot of high-functioning, like minded people, which means you'll make a lot of friends. The pay is competitive for a retail job.
","The job is as challenging as it is rewarding - and as of late the challenges outweighed the rewards. Pay is not negotiable and superior sales performance is given little to no consideration during your 'merit increases' which are 3.5-5% per year, once a year. 

The high customer traffic, high noise, bright lights, and being on your feet for 8-9 hours can be physically taxing. Full-time work during holiday and launch season can be draining. The customers in my area were typically high-maintenance types and were often difficult to deal with.

Advancing in the company is more about playing the political game than how well your actual job is being done, which frequently results in people being advanced to management and leadership positions who do not have the right hard skills or competencies for the task. A good leadership team can really shape your experience at Apple as much as the work you put into it.

Mon Dec 14 2020, Analyst,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,So-So,2,"- New ideas are encouraged
- Coworkers and peers are incredibly smart
","- The Apple culture is changing for worse. What was once a prestigious tech company who had a passion for innovation and people has disappeared and turned into a powerhouse of labor exploitation. Expect long hours and little pay
- On average, Apple provides around 3% pay raises each year. This does not cover the increasing costs of living in Austin. It doesn’t matter how great of an employee you are, you should expect 3%. There is no reason to work hard.
- Apple does not care about the city of Austin or the citizens that live here. Apple takes tax breaks and incentives, while continuing to white-wash any culture out of Austin, contribute to awful traffic patterns, and keeping overall city wages stagnant.
- Utilizing time off benefits is frowned upon. Workload sits for you to complete when you return, negating any kind of ""refreshment"" you feel from being away
- No room for promotions. Management does not care about development or helping you explore other opportunities. 
- Management is constantly talking about how much money our department has saved the company (we’re talking millions of dollars), meanwhile a peer on my team is on food stamps.
- Many of my peers are struggling with mental health issues due to being overworked and not having enough time off. Apple’s health benefits barely cover any type of treatment for mental health issues. Even the “top tier” health insurance plan does not cover widely accepted mental health treatment and instead insurance encourages you to take Xanax.
- When we had on-site doctors, they were low quality and constantly gaslight you

Management repeatedly ignored complaints from almost a dozen employees of color about racist managers and misleading requirements for advancement. The company talks about inclusion and simultaneously hires employees who are belligerent because they are confident that they will not face repercussions.

","No managers or support even when customers are screaming at you. Many of my co workers are having mental health issues because of how this job is designed and Apple does not want to hear about it. It is so stressful. I've never worked in a place that I could not get support from a manager. It does not exist in this role. Imagine someone has purchased a $3000 laptop and it never arrived in the mail and they have been given the wrong info when they called before (and the time before that). Yep sorry no you can't speak to a manager because there aren't any and I'm working at home. It's just you and me on the phone and you're yelling at me and there's nothing I can do. For the first few weeks I felt like this was the second worst job I have ever had but now that I've done it for a few months, it's moved into the number one spot. I have nightmares and can’t sleep most nights. I dread sitting at my desk and taking a call because you never know what you’re going to get on the other end of the line. And the whole set up is right in the middle of my home so even when I’m not working, it sits there and I have to look at it. I can’t get away.

Design this system differently so specialists can get a manager on the line to speak with customers who demand it. The world is different now and Apple needs to adapt.

Advice to Management
During training you tell us that “we want to help you grow” but when the time comes they never do. Depending on what store your working in or the manager, some do really want to help the employee succeed. But in my store anytime you talk with a manager about wanting to grow, in-company career opportunities their not there to help. During Covid, I understand it’s hard times and they want to keep us safe, but I was hired as a sales specialist and made me work as an AHA advisor troubleshooting etc. I was never trained as a technician! I was trained as a sales representative. Felt like I was drafted in the military when they started making us work from home. I wouldn’t have a problem working from home if it was RCC (at home retail advisor). As an AHA it was too stressful and less pay for it too.
