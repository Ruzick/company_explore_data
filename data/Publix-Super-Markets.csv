Thu Jan 21 2021, Customer Service Staff,"Saint Augustine, FL",Current Employee ,Good & Bad,0,"If your are committed to growth and voice that to your management team, they will commit to fast tracking you (given you have the experience and work ethic needed). They give free stock to full time employees, equivalent to approx 8% of your year-end gross. This is their big draw; this is why people stick it out with Publix. Once in management, they will move you approx every 2 years to a different store location, whether promotion or lateral move. This has two sides—the pro being that you are frequently exposed to different leadership styles, thus preventing you from becoming complacent in your role. They are closed 3 holidays each year, I have previously only had 1 guaranteed holiday at other retailers. This would have been a con, but they have started rolling out an improvement. Publix use to give all employees, including managers, their weekly schedule ONLY 3 days prior to the start of that new schedule. They’re now going to be giving it out 10 days prior.
","Not enough diversity in the staff. I’ve worked for some major retailers and they always walked the walk when it came to their values of diversity and inclusion. Publix does not—they only talk the talk. 
Their pay is sub par compared to other grocery or big box competitors, many starting at $15/hr. Once you get “full time” status, you still have to wait 90 days to be eligible for medical insurance. Most companies, it’s within 30 days. Ridiculous this hasn’t been modified during a worldwide pandemic. You don’t earn sick time until AFTER a year of “full time” service. While this isn’t a big issue to me, as I VERY RARELY have used sick time during my last 10 years in retail management, it’s more so a matter of principle. Even if it was 1 or 2 days for the first year (8-16 hours) to start with, before increasing. The rest of their benefits are pretty lackluster as well (the stock is the one big draw for people). Once in management, they will move you approx every 2 years to a different store location, whether promotion or lateral move. This has two sides—the con being you could be moved further and have a longer commute. Their dress code and uniforms are ancient. Not allowing dress pants to be fitted at the ankle (get with the times, Publix!) and the uniform tops are the ugliest, most uncomfortable things I’ve ever worn... but hopefully won’t have to for much longer. Management wears their choice of professional dress, but still strict guidelines on things like the fit of the pants.

Hours: This could be a con or pro, but you get plenty of hours.

Benefits/ perks: They offer the standard heath care that's decent.
","Extremely Physical: You basically get paid to work out, not bad till you consider you will have to do 7 day stretches at least once a month.
Schedule: This one is the worst to me. No set schedule, it alternates each week. You will end up working 7 days in a row to only have 1 day off then go back for 5 more. Things like that make you feel more like a slave then a valued employee.
High turn over: Its hard and tough, so people come and go a lot. 
Management: Can not speak for all of them but in my department it feels like they don't know what they are doing. Constantly understaffed and keep adding more work though out the day, turning a decent day into a long dragged out one.

• District Managers come in often and are considered normal
• Straight forward reference and procedure guides
• Good equipment to work with
","• Your manager will change every 6 months
• Some managers shouldn’t be managers
• Part-time employees are viewed lesser, even if they can work circles around full-time employees
• Pay is terrible; I am maxed out and Costco, Walmart, Best Buy, and Target starts at a higher pay than my maxed out pay. – I really should leave
• No Employee discounts like Publix’s competition
• Publix takes pride in its stock, but if you quit within 3-years it is not really yours and the company takes it away. 
• At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic if you attempted to ware a mask at work, we were told to take it off or go home.
• Publix pretended they care about employee safety regarding COVID-19, but they never enforce face masks, and did not require customers to wear them during a time employee were required to wear them. If you deny a customer service that is not wearing a face mask and they complain you will be talked to about how you should not refuse customer service.
• You only get a 3-minute grace period for being late, but they will be allowed to work you an unlimited amount of time after your shift was supposed to end.
• Publix has no 10-15-minute paid breaks.
• You can work 6 hours or more without a break and it will be considered normal. Other companies require breaks before the 6th hour mark.
• Publix has loosed up the dress code recently, but they fired a guy for having a man-bun. He was a 10 out of 10 worker fired for his hair. I once was yelled at because I did not have a buzz-cut.
• I have worked at Publix for 5 years. I have seen people been discriminated against because of race and sexual orientation.
• If you arrive early at work and ring the doorbell to get in and you wait forever for someone to open the door then you are still considered late.
• If you get off work at the end of the night and you are waiting for they MIC to let you out and lock the door behind you while you are clocked out then you are not getting paid for 10+ minutes you being forced to stay in the building.
• I got a COVID-19 test when I was sick and waited to return to work until it came back negative. I was told the missed days will count against me in my next review. Not like I am able to get a raise anyways.
• If you are a part-time employee, they will refuse to train you for higher paying positions, such as cutting meat or cheese specialist unless you go full-time. Even if you work in the same department and have been with the company forever.
• Full-time employees are required to commit their life to Publix being available anytime except two weekdays.

I saw a lot of rotating managers, some managers I think should have been held to the same standards of the least paid employees.

Expects too much, and they put an unhealthy amount of pressure on a person. Realistically, they will push you to your limit before you know it, and to move up or be qualified to move from PT to FT, you as a person and the work you do is point based so get to know your worth before you start. So if you give it your all the first 3 months then by the time the next evaluation comes around you will have to be better & score better than previously if you want to move up from this to that, in any dept., to get a raise or just move from part to full time.

Advice to Management
The management system is very imbalanced and too many of the managers are ill-prepared for the job and/or rude to their underlings. Too often did I have managers that were very rude and gave me their managerial duties and left me alone without help on Wednesday nights or left me to get their truck orders. There were also times I had to do inventory counts by myself when I was not the manager and never had the training to do so. I found it irresponsible and unacceptable that despite all of this, I was never given a proper raise or an adequate salary for my hard work.

Publix is great for short term, it's only good for long-term if you have nothing in your life to do and never went to college.
","Management is half and half. At least at my store they give great hours but for how much work I do, I only get paid $10.50. 

I also was told I was getting promoted to get paid more, but that hasn't reflected in my Publix org profile for 3 weeks now. I've been working at Publix since COVID started and haven't gotten one evaluation yet either to get promoted even further.

If you have employees not pushing their own weight, they won't let them go. Especially in a smaller store, they need all the help they can get.

Publix takes pride in ""Intolerant of waste"" although each night tons of waste gets trashed. People who didn't buy the extra chicken they made or the hundreds of donuts. Publix should be donating this food to food banks each night instead of tossing it. That's if they really have these core values in place.

1 of our full time front end employees hasn't been to work for like 5 months and they don't want to let her go and give her benefits to someone else. Speaking of full time, an employee in the Deli who worked at Publix for only 3 months got full time even though he's horrible at his job. Nice management.

2 people in my store got COVID-19, but no management staff wanted to inform us who had it. We also found out about this issue through our employee Portal, they don't even tell us in person. CEO of Publix doesn't care about your safety.

There are career opportunities if you are a really hard dependable worker (which takes a LOT of time to prove to them). Managers make good pay/vacation time, if you can put in the years of time to get that far.
","If you are part time (I started part time), you could get 8 hours or you could get 38 hours. It depends on how many they currently have employed in your department at the time (they have hiring 'binges'), or if by chance it's a holiday weekend and they are busy, then they actually want you to work overtime. And it also *depends if your manager likes you or not. It is also fast paced because it's too few workers, for much work. They will work you to the bone, and sometimes still tell you that you that you didn't get enough done. They don't like excuses. Not enough mentors/tutors, I’ve seen too many employees in different department doing something wrong and nobody saying otherwise (including managers).

-inconsistent hours. all of a sudden I was the closer every night by myself at a high volume store because the store fired the closer that had been there for 20 years for accepting some chicken they were going to throw away.

","You're constantly promised opportunities to advance that barely exist, you're promised raises that will be far less than what you deserve, and you will always feel like you're just treading water. It becomes very clear after a few months that the management plays favorites and if you're not one of the favorites, you will get the minimum raise amount if any, you will never be promoted, and you have zero incentive to do anything besides the bare minimum amount of work required to keep your job there. They do not care about your ideas to improve work flow or the work environment and there is absolutely no wiggle room in how things may be done. They are looking strictly for people to blindly follow orders and will suck the soul out of you. They also pay significantly less than ALL of the competition. It's a bland corporate environment that only benefits the people who are willing to play along and pretend like the company isn't just a money-grabbing, racist corporation.

Side note: When the pandemic hit, every single company besides Publix gave out hazard pay or some sort of bonus compensation. We got a $50 gift card at the beginning of the pandemic and the first time someone at your store got COVID, you got another gift card as some sort of hush money. Disgusting. The gift cards were taxed by the way, and the taxes were taken out of your pay check.
Advice to Management
Quit neutering your employees. Get out while you can. Even as managers, your managers don't care about you. Every single person at this company is as disposable as the next and if you think you're not then you've fallen into the trap.

Tue Nov 03 2020, Grocery Stock Clerk,,Current Employee ,A Moderate Place to Work,0,"I've been working part time for about 8 months now. The pay is good enough for a part time job. While I haven't actually gone for tuition reimbursement, from what I understand it is very doable and can be rather nice.
","While the managers and team leaders may be nice, that all changes after you've been with the store long enough. You start to notice that all they seem to do is talk on their phones and to each other, while at the same time getting mad when you talk to your fellow co-workers for a grand total of 5 minutes while you still get more work done than they've done all week. Schedule requesting can be a bit tough if its more of a last minute deal. I also work the closing shift which means that I am there from 2:00-11:00, which means I pretty much go to bed shortly after I get home. So with that in mind, I had some personal activities that took place on Mondays and Wednesdays and started around 7:30, so I asked my manager if I could have my schedule shifted to allow me to attend such events (since I work on truck days aka Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and usually have Mondays off). So the following 2 weeks nothing happened simply because I had some time off requests and they were working around them, but the third week, I get scheduled for Monday and Wednesday for the closing shift, its like stuff like that just doesn't click with them, or maybe I got on someone's bad side because the Publix way is favoring certain employees over others. For instance, the person at my store who is responsible for changing the sale tags on Tuesdays found out one day that they didn't get a promotion, so instead of sucking it up, they left within 20 minutes of being there and left the rest of use to do their job, and as far as I know, nothing has been done to punish them, they still get every single weekend off as a full time associate and seem to get away with doing barely any work within a reasonable amount of time.
Advice to Management
Stop having favorites, I know it will be natural to have favorites, but keep it to yourself. Also, maybe you should consider doing some actual work because all you seem to do it yell at everyone when they appear to not be doing work while you just sit in the front office talking to each other. And not to mention getting on to employees about only one person needs to do this job when three of you work on setting up a display that should only take one person to do.
