","Being a large corporation they are sometimes their own worst enemy. They come up with great ideas, implement them and then change within a couple of months without really giving things a chance to be successful. It's tough to claim that you are the best or going to be the best at selling cars. That all the competition will try to mirror what AutoNation does and then not follow through on some of those ideas that would get you there!
Advice to Management
When you come up with a plan - Implement it with a clear plan, manage it and allow it to have the time to be successful before giving up on it. Or, at least modify the plan in an effort to make it wotk imstead of just killing the idea and going back to the way we have always done things. We all know in todays world that you can't be the best by doing things the way we always have, especially in the car business!

Wed Sep 11 2019, Manager,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Current Employee ,"If You're Good At What You Do, Do It Elsewhere",0,"Pros are entirely team-based. If you have a good team, your day-to-day might be tolerable.

Fortune 500 company, which looks good to some other employers when you look for real opportunity elsewhere.
","Where to begin...

AutoNation is lightyears behind on technology and processes, and it's not going to get better any time soon. 

Executive leadership (with a few small exceptions) is out of their depth in the current consumer environment. They think automotive sales is special and can still be run the way it was in the 1970s. See the dubious tenure of Carl Liebert (who was fired for thinking he could actually be the CEO). They're simply not ready to move forward.

Employee pricing on vehicles is a joke. Every dealership you go to will start by telling you they can get you a better deal without the corporate pricing structure. Once you look at the numbers, it's clear that they're trying to screw you like any standard dealer. This is the company culture. It's not a team, and if it were, you're not on it.

Certain areas work as legitimate meritocracies, but good luck finding that out before you start. More likely, you'll end up in a group where advancement is based on personal connections (exclusively) with no regard at all to the ability to do the job.

Contractors - AVOID THIS PLACE. No matter what they tell you about converting to full-time, they rarely do so. If you like contracting, go for it (if you don't care about anything listed above). If you want to be on staff, look anywhere else.

Benefits are a joke. Expensive healthcare options, ridiculously low 401(k) match (50% of 4% - 2% max). 

Don't expect regular or decent raises. There's always an excuse or delay, probably related to a mass-firing of director-level and above talent (which you would expect to free up some money).
Advice to Management
The old guard needs to retire, starting with Mike Jackson. This is not the consumer environment they grew up in, and they're not dynamic enough to shift with the times. Until this happens, AutoNation is going to continue to disappoint employees and shareholders. Not to mention that Cheryl Miller isn't going to be able to run the company with MJ pulling the strings.

I have been working at AutoNation full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
The training provided at AutoNation will help increase your value to the other publicly owned dealership chains and private cap owners once you decide to leave AutoNation.
Cons
Market management truly doesn't appreciate the sales / CFS management team. You'll find part of your job consists of being constantly berated by upper market management. I'm not sure If market management is treated this way by regional and Fort Lauderdale management continuously, but I'd imagine it must be a cycle of abuse. The hours are going to be long in the auto industry no matter what dealership you work at.
The pay plan should motivate and reward employees for achieving market share, CSI, etc. The current pay plans are designed to reduce employee compensation (Doesn't affect Market, Region or Fort Lauderdale compensation) to offset the auto industry being in a down cycle. If your in the auto industry and are considering working for AutoNation just be aware of what you getting into.
Advice to Management
Listen to employees (not just market employees and reports) and practice what you preach. ""One Team.""

Forget about new cars because every general manager is so focused on volume and making our reports look good to the RODM, MP, and RP.

","Took a reputable business and turned it 180 degrees around, back to the old days of lie, cheat, steel and never give the money back. I fought this mentality for twenty years, and now autonation has done everything in their power to bring it back. Their compensation package is so small for sales staff, that they need second incomes. It's to the point where most sales staff are compensated so poorly, that hiring English speaking employees had become difficult. Most sales staff, English was there second language. They take good dealerships and turn them into ""grinder"" stores. If you complain, they find someone else that won't mind putting in the 14 to 16 hour days. Constant job security threats.

","Lots of cons: upper management would belittle you, make fun of/rip you apart in front of everyone, the payplan breeds weak salespeople/order takers and is in direct conflict with how the sales managers get paid. Employees don't care if a sale makes gross, they get paid based on units while management is on gross.

Floor flooded with salespeople, they hire anything off the street (ever sit next to someone with recent charges for beating a woman? ), people would fight for half deals (cars 1-10 is $50 a car) so during slow months you're gonna have people after you for $25. 

Turnover is bad, partly due to the toxic culture in the dealership. The GSM would make thinly veiled threats to people about them getting fired in the middle of the showroom, would insult you, etc. 

Numbers were always faked (cars marked sold when the customer didn't even put a deposit down, appointments were faked, etc) 

The hours are terrible too. It got to a point I was starting to hate my life. 

It's a great way to learn how to sell cars though, and with the right sales managers on your side and teaching you, you can go anywhere. 

Never touching a corporate owned dealership again.

Managers won’t hear your words if you’re a woman, but as soon as a man is involved “oh yea he must be right,” worst off is... when you DONT have the answer to everything but hey act and expect like you should know everything... and the next day they might be understanding that you won’t have all the answers but the day after they’ll flip out again expecting you to know it all. Because at the end of the day they’ll backtrack on their words and try something new each week to improve the dealership but nothing ever sticks or works out. Drama in the sales department. Managers who don’t know how to speak professionally to their employees; your sarcasm and profanity is not appreciated. You are NOT my parent, so YOU don’t get to treat US like children.

We’re about making a difference in the community through auto sales. AutoNation has raised over $12 million dollars to fund research to help find a cure for cancer. We are also the largest auto retailer in the US, and we’re the first to sell over 11 million vehicles. This is a company that values its clients and its associates. Our mission is to “deliver a peerless customer experience” and our vision is to “be America’s best place to buy and service cars and trucks.” In order to do that, we go to great lengths to retain our most valued asset: our employees.

","In IT, the new CTO brings his colleagues who all got laid off from his ex-workplace due to M&A. Almost all the management positions till the Director levels are replaced with the members of his old boy's club. None of this new club members has any interest in winning the confidence of the team they are supposed to lead. Most of them don't even talk to any of their team members including managers. They are all behaving in the same fashion that their only purpose in AutoNation is to please their club leader and has zero concern on the well being of their team.

No access to 85% of sales leads to internet dept and 10% from service drive sales people means 10% of the walkin customers are divided among the other 40 sales people standing behind trees , hiding in tents and ready to pounce on anyone who pulls in. Management is absurd here as they break u down b4 a Saturday sales meeting then make the place feel like a prison all the time your standing outside in rain sleet or 105 degree days. I stayed 60 days, made less than minimum wage and they will steal your last check so beware of that. You will not get what you earned and they will back charge you for everything. Terrible place.

Thu Jun 07 2018, Senior DevOps Engineer,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Former Employee ,Horrible Management - Anywhere is better!,4,"Honestly, there aren’t many pros as far as work environment goes. Complete disconnect from execs down to management. Managers are horrible at managing! Disconnect between departments, the whole place is in flux because no one really knows how any of the tech stack actually works. All the good tech is being managed by offshore teams.
","I’ll reiterate what I stated above - The Manager is not a leader and should not be in a management position. The Manager constantly belittles the team and has absolutely no sense of leadership. Even the current people on the team are waiting for a better job to come along once they have more experience. No real talent stays because of this. This is also why no one that currently works there knows how anything actually works.

","Managers will tell you that unless you have an appointment you cant go home. Which is ILLEGAL. They cant make you work more than 8 hours a day legally but they do it all the time. I was told by my manager to approve of my time card which had 30 hours less than I worked. He assured me, being new that I would still receive the pay I was due which was a lie to the tune of 300 dollars. I am ready to go off I call endless calls of dead leads which is essentially advertising for auto nation. Unscrupulous business practices. They want me to lie and say they have sales when there really is none. 0% apr-- which is a myth. Even the word tracks are lies. Really trying hard to make a go. So far unable to. I fell more dishonest every day. Shady Mc shady in effect here.
