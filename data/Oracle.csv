Tue Oct 21 2014, Technical Analyst III (Support),"Denver, CO",Former Employee ,"Great benefits, good people, slow innovation, no raises",1005,"Every group/division can be different in how they treat their employees, but I'd say overall there is very good atmosphere of trust and fairness. There is a strong focus on education, and they reimburse for outside classes taken (Up to 5k/year I think). Benefits are good, and I'd say quite competitive in the market. Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater). Free drinks in the breakroom. Flexibility to work from home at times. (If you live 50+ miles away from an office you can work full-time from home...policy).
","They don't try to make the workplace anything special (maybe a pool table and arcade game are cliche or gimmicky?). In the 10 years I've worked there, they've given 2 measly %1 cost of living raises (this is the same with most everyone I've spoken to, some don't get any raises). You will not get a substantial raise ever, unless you leave then get rehired on (they will not match offers, better to leave). New employees that you train will make 10 - 20K more than you several years after you hire on (not just me, they do this to all tenured employees). They will give these untrained, less experienced people higher titles (again this is done to everyone not just me). You learn pretty quickly that you're dispensable. The company has billions in cash and they don't re-invest in their employees, just in acquiring new companies and hiring new people that know nothing that you get to train.
Advice to Management
Relax on the multi-million dollar VP salaries and bonuses for a few years so that you can reinvest in your employees. It's obscene how a company will not try to retain it's employees who play the most pivotal part in bringing in the money that you horde from them.

","Persistent issues with top-down communication and direction; no practical support or training for managers, so many poor ones here; whistleblowers tend to be punished; review and promotion system is very broken (and was skipped entirely in 2020), leading to a lot of resentment and frustration; focus on hiring devs from competitors over hiring quality candidates where needed in the business is also causing resentment and frustration; suffers from the same sexism issues as most of tech (women rarely promoted into leadership, women paid less than their male counterparts); high-level execs seems disconnected from reality and their employees (one recently announced that ""cost of living has gone down this year"" as justification for no one below a specific managerial level getting COLAs).

I worked at Oracle full-time for more than a year
Pros
They hire a ton of college graduates, a strategy shared by all smart companies in my opinion. As such, it means they're willing to teach and train, and the investment they make in employees is much appreciated. I learned a lot about technologies that had previously been foreign: database, middleware, infrastructure, on-premises, and cloud solutions. Plus, it also pays well for people who lack experience. Never found it to be a particularly demanding job, and I very very rarely took home work after leaving.
Cons
The other side of hiring young is that many managers are young and often unqualified. They don't seek out input from those who are managed, so if you get a poor manager it means you're likely stuck with them, and their word will hold more weight than yours. Being tied to sales means you're also tied to quotas and other unimportant metrics, many of which are typically outside of your control.

Advice to Management
Directors in this department are more concerned with keeping people who perform well where they are to keep their own behinds covered instead of rewarding them with growth and further incentive. On one team I know of, the supervisor (who came over from sales and knows nothing about the software or the anything beyond making things look good on paper) was promoted and probably given raises multiple times. Most of the people on the hardworking team beneath her have been stuck in the same spot since before she arrived despite having done more than enough to progress to better things. My advice to management is to acknowledge this position of what it is, a stepping stone job, and reward the people that are making you look good instead of keeping them in the same place simply so that they can continue to do so.

Former Employee - Cloud Engineer 
I worked at Oracle full-time for less than a year
Pros
Best in class equipment (Macbook's samsung monitors, etc...etc), free beverages and gym on campus and experience with the latest and future technologies.
Cons
- Extremely hit or miss management. I worked there for 11 months and had 3 managers. 
- Being a large organization, they reorg all the time, which causes roles and territories to get mixed around. 
- Too much information for entry level employees to master. (Other companies such as Salesforce or AWS don't start college grads in these roles for a reason).
Advice to Management
- Be honest about what a ""Cloud Engineer"" is. Sales Engineering is a great role, but calling it a Cloud (specialization) Engineer role does not sound like sales at all. 
- Don't set the salary the same for all the hubs when COL is much higher in D.C, Boston and Santa Monica then Austin.

I worked at Oracle full-time for more than a year
Pros
Amazing place to start your career. Beautiful building and an opportunity to live in LA and work near the beach. Your peers are a ton of people your age so the culture is great. You learn a ton of great tech industry and business knowledge and skills but at the end of the day, it's a sales gig. Day after day of cold calls, emails, linkedin messages. Quarter after quarter of demanding quotas, stressful micromanagement tendencies and repetitive trainings.

Overall, it's a great place to get experience in the industry, especially if you want to go into sales. For the 80% of BDCs who don't want to be in sales and never wanted to be in the first place, it's a good name-recognizable place holder on your resume for your next job.
Cons
Work satisfaction often depends heavily on who your manager is (micromanagey, etc)

Mon Jan 25 2021,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Hit or Miss,0,"Overall, the direction the company is moving in is really positive. There's going to be more alignment between product and customer-facing teams and there is a lot of product innovation happening. It's really exciting to see. The healthcare cover is fantastic. It's really really difficult to get fired.
","This is where the hit or miss comes into play. Some managers are fantastic and you'd be really fortunate to be on their team and be mentored by them. Other managers are really toxic and just plain awful. The 401K match and stock purchase plan left a lot to be desired considering the profitability of the company. Stock purchase plan offered a 5% discount, which is something but it could be more generous. The org structure is all over the place; there's little consistency across accounts, making it really difficult to know who to turn to and where responsibilities lie.
Advice to Management
Perform 360 reviews on managers and directors. I was given plenty of feedback, but unless a manager or director asked me for feedback, I didn't have the opportunity to give it. Poor managers cherry pick those to give them year-end evals, so their awful management skills go unnoticed and unimproved. For those way up at the tippy-top, remove the red tape and barriers for people to move teams and roles within the org. We're told attrition is at an all-time high, but then we're hanging on forever to get a transfer; this is pushing us to just look elsewhere.

","Overworked and underpaid, the Oracle sales floors, once buzzing, are now barren wastelands. Management actively tells you NOT to learn about the product as a salesperson, so you don'tr realize how behind the competition our technologies are. Salespeople are forced to act on a detached management's half-baked ideas, both for sales plays and sales teams, effectively forcing the good talent out when they realize how backwards (or absent) the strategy is. In App sales, we were told to preach collaboration between departments, and how THAT is the key to successful business execution... 3 years later as a salesman, I still couldn't name anyone in Oracle's Marketing department. Bottom line, as an Oracle sales representative, you're forced to lie to the customer, produce results with a failing strategy, and give up any peace of mind/free time when your manager doesn't like your weekly results and makes you stay until 7:30 on a Friday to prove you want your job (without overtime of course!). Management at Oracle likes to push everyone until they're a burnt out, depressed, soggy little shell of the employee they originally hired. To all the college students looking at Class Of, do it, but dont stay more than 1 quarter after you get promoted. The abuse you take in 1 year here is more than anything you'll ever have to deal with at a healthy working environment.
Advice to Management
Pay increases to at least match inflation. Think through your ideas before turning them into teams, and rethink the company management style of ""Just put more pressure on them"". Thats how you get suicides, not productive employees.

You need to push more money to the lower rungs of the company. Oracle doesn't have the ""hot young cool"" reputation like Google, Facebook, or Salesforce so it's hard to pull in young talent.

Advice to Management
You need to stop bleeding engineers by properly compensating your US employees outside of OCI, and adopt corporate legal and security policies compatible with a culture of innovation. I have witnessed your posture of legal/security risk aversion cost us multiple 8-figure deals due to the tremendous strain it puts on our ability to act on partnerships in a timely manner, and the chronic failure to innovate induced by this culture poses an existential threat to our business. Retain and empower your ICs.

","Though I was in a ""start-up"" portion of the company, there was a tremendous amount of mismanagement across the board. From team leaders to higher up, the levels of actual work being completed was minimal with books being cooked and favoritism all across the board. Which is probably why that section was disbanded, but the new direction wasn't any better. No sooner had we crossed into the new fiscal year, than layoffs became necessary. Why it was necessary was above my pay-grade... All I know is they gave little direction or metrics for success towards the end. You can't improve if you don't know the goal.
Advice to Management
Be more transparent. Create success metrics for all departments and teams. Let them prove their worth before summarily dismissing them. Or give them ample time to re-situate themselves in the company instead of the standard two weeks. It can be a great company to work for if the management hires leaders who think more about their product and employees rather than their own bonuses.

Pros
If you find yourself in the ""Right"" organization within the company, there are many benefits. If you don't, your experience may be vastly different. In some organizations:
- More stable parts of the organization provide a feeling of job security - its common for people to leave and come back a few months/years later
- Lots of opportunity for working across teams and getting exposure to different areas
- Unlimited vacation (not applicable to all orgs and not all countries)
Cons
- It seems that the company is constantly reorganizing, so if you find yourself in a less stable part of the organization, expect to have a new role and new management chain at least every year, if not even more often.
- If you are fortunate enough to be in a more stable part of the company, there is much more security but little room for upward growth and development
- The typical red tape exists, as expected at any mega company of this size

I worked at Oracle full-time
Pros
Most co-workers are very friendly
Lots of new hires who try to make a positive difference
Cons
North America Applications leadership doesn't care about talent development, career progression, rewards & recognition and morale within the consulting organization that reports up to NAA.
A serious lack of talent prohibits efficient & effective project management of the consulting engagements to implement the cloud applications
Consulting projects are underestimated, under priced and under staffed with weak project governance. Most projects are in red status. Consultants work tirelessly to make up for the deficiencies and to cover scope creep to keep customers happy.
Application licensing teams whip the consulting organization around by giving short notice on pursuit deadlines, slash estimates, margin & contingency and overpromise on scope & service levels. 
Those same projects are highly marketed within Oracle as success stories.
Promotions from Analyst to Sr. Analyst have been rare (though getting better). Promotions above Sr. Analyst are extremely rare. Salary increases are extremely rare.

This is a major leadership flaw. Stop competing internally - on prem vs. cloud selling into the same account is stupid. Customers disengage with this and marketing needed an overhaul, but no real progress has been seen to date. OCI is the only technology that works, so no wonder there is growth.

Pros
Decent benefits, matching for lots of charities, NS ERP is great.
Cons
Constant churn in mgmt, no raises/comp changes regardless of performance, 4 mgrs in 2.5 yrs, only way to get a raise is to leave and come back 12 months later, heard this from multiple people. Seems like there is very much a clique of who's in - they get the spoils. Feels like factory job and just as mind numbing, cannot find a new job fast enough. Everything w/ Oracle is self service so if you have computer issues, good luck. 'Unlimited PTO' is a joke, holidays count against you so anytime not billing is a dinge on your billability. The only reason for 'unlimited PTO' is so they don't have to pay out when you leave. Not allowed to schedule PTO more than 3 months in advance.
Advice to Management
There is no incentive to stay, zero comp changes in 3 yrs. No career opportunity with constant churn in mgmt. My efforts make zero difference in my comp, mgmt only cares about CSAT, no reason to 'go the extra mile'. Unlimited PTO - really? Sounds great, if it were really only true.

","No focal, no RSU, no bonus, no promotion, no work hour flexibilities and no performance reviews. Management lack of technical and management skills to lead teams. They seem to be waiting for their retirement. Internal job rotation punishes employees with no career and monetary growth. Managements also set higher expectation on employees who work there for more than 4 years while offering new hires who have less related working experience same title and higher salaries (Yes, because no salary adjustment ever since). They are only interest in retaining new hires as they think people who work there for over 4 years are pretty much stuck with the team/company. The only way to grow at Oracle is to getting offers from other companies so that they know you are not stuck with them
Advice to Management
Value those who have been contributing at the company for more than 4 years and are willing to actively take challenges and learn new things by volunteering themselves in job rotations within the team/department in the company. They shouldn't be punished with no growth.

Promote those who have technical skills to managers so that they can at least lead the teams with their experiences and decision-making mindset instead of doing nothing on both technical issues and people management and waiting for retirement.

This is 101 and 201 out of the BDR program and you will learn if you are a right fir for Oracle or if you will find success at most other companies. The Oracle sales model is an esoteric bundling of overlapping teams where it becomes easy to lose sight of the customer unless you're highly collaborative and willing to sell your own interests internally before ever becoming part of true customer relationships. It is difficult to maintain coherence of Oracle's brand ownership but if all the overlapping teams are able to coordinate effectively, they become a deal-making machine. It is all a numbers game, internally and externally. If this type of sales does not suit you, then you can walk onto most other sales roles because of the excellent training and development resources that resemble more of an academy than onboarding.

There are some talented people working here. Unfortunately, politics is the main driver, not quality of work or customers.

If you work here, use it as a stepping stone to other jobs and don't think of it as a place to stay long. The top executive's political contributions to advance his own agenda are at odds with Oracle's corporate message of diversity & inclusion.

I worked at Oracle full-time for more than a year
Pros
There are lots of opportunity to learn and if you’re motivated enough, and depending on the type of projects you work on, the teams can be great to work with. It’s a nice enough out of college job and with the free certifications, it’s easy to jump over to a partner firm (with much higher pay).
Cons
First off, the middle management seems either incapable or unwilling to actually act towards any change. So what you say to your manager likely won’t go anywhere. The staffing model also needs improvement; the current system leaves several consultants grossly overworked and others without any work. In the past year the culture has almost completely disappeared (even pre covid) in favor of a high turnover rate. They hire almost exclusively college grads for the consultant role and as a result there’s a huge knowledge gap between older and newer consultants, where older consultants don’t have time to train new ones. You’re also encouraged to value utilization over quality. They say it’s a strong 9-5 culture unless you’re in the group of overworked consultants- then it’s however long it takes to get the job done.
Advice to Management
With the current promotion system, there’s little to no incentive to continue high utilization with work. Transparency would also go a long way in improving the culture. With how secretive things are internally, it leads to a lot of speculation and rumors. Also, spend more time taking care of the current consultants vs hiring new ones who are untrained.

","The most alarming thing about working here is that they are losing clients like crazy and management doesn't realize it's because they are a bunch of patronizing snobs. Primarily all-white management of the same breed, they speak negatively about their utility clients internally, yet assume their clients should stay loyal to them. Clients are dropping like flies primarily due to Management.

Little or no upward mobility unless you are a legacy Opower person. Management promotes themselves every year, but does not promote their own people. Management is also racist and only promotes white employees.

They don't appreciate the stability and breadth that Oracle provides them. Legacy Opower management believe that Oracle is holding them back. Reality check - it's incompetent and stuck up management who are the source of all issues.

The lack of organization and transparency make it difficult to outline a timeline for your career path, and many people are becoming frustrated by the ""unknowns.""

Advice to Management
Wake up!! Many good employees are leaving Oracle (yes, even in this job market) to go to other tech companies who pay them what they are worth. If you don't stop the practice of not paying hard working/dedicated employees what they should be paid, more will leave and more will go to competitors who pay better, e.g. Amazon AWZ, Google, Salesforce.com, etc. You can't be #1 in the industry with #3 and lower employees. You get what you pay for. Pay your employees fairly!!

","The management is very under trained and incapable of helping you. They are all clearly there to just collect a paycheck. The CRM is very unorganized and makes your life very difficult. The whole culture of the BDR organization makes you feel like you are being judged on many levels. I felt very uncomfortable being in the office as it wasn't very inclusive and you are treated as just another number. Hard to develop professionally when the management isn't very professional. Your vertical is randomly given to you and this could result in you either being fired or hitting your quota. Some of the industries you will work in are clearly not well thought out and result in everyone majorly struggling and getting ridiculed/called out in front of others.
