Approves of CEO
I have been working at Broadcom full-time for less than a year
Pros
Work from home. Plenty of time off if needed. Great people and so far great management.
Cons
Not everyone gets to work from. When having people go back to the office during COVID-19 in 2020 they pretty much said that if you could not go to the office you were out the door. We had a lot of really good people leave because of this.
Advice to Management
Greg Lotko telling a story about how he had to really think about the job he was at one time and if it was worth staying for and comparing it to COVID-19 situation and going to the office was really unbelievable. This showed the huge lack of any understanding of anyone's situation but his own. Saying if you have to go into the office and did not want to during COVID-19 see the door was just silly. Even more silly since the work we do is easily done remote. Sure, he would say we can talk about it more offline, but when the folks did, they moved on to other companies, so really it did mean see ya. He seems to show a lack of caring for those under him. Has said a number of times that if you don't like it, leave the company. I have been here less than a year and I have heard him say this a few times in different ways. Not the most comforting thing to hear so often from upper management.

Hock Tran tries to explain why we are doing something and tries to keep things light if possible. He presents things with care and thought, which is nice to see and hear.

My direct manager and his manager are great. Information is provided to us as soon as they get it and always present anything that may seem bad in as good a light as possible.

I was very proud to work at this prestigious company. CA mainframe products are the best. As an engineer, I could have not been more satisfied. Due to reduction in force in a COVID era, I was sad to let go. The company offers all the major benefits in addition to stocks and bonuses.

- No investment in employee career growth or opportunities to advance
- Inflexible, often draconian HR policies
- Don't care about customer experience or customer sat - especially with ""low revenue"" accounts
- Everything is done on the extreme cheap
- Implemented aggressive return to office policies during covid-19 - even though many positions can work from home. Now tracking employees via forced smart phone app on corporate phones. Really???

","Upper management hates headcount, they'll lay people off solely on the fact that they want the team smaller so they can push up the stock dividends a couple cents higher next quarter. They'll lay off talent and those that know the product best just to save a buck or two. Ends up killing the product line and they let the rest of the team go soon after.
Management is heartless. Politics is rampant, you can't escape it. If upper management doesn't like your numbers, they don't care, you and your department are gone immediately, even if you have had a bunch of successful quarters and one doesn't do as well. They are also very greedy. They do not like to share in the bonuses or dividends, the less people getting those, the better.
Broadcom has almost no employee loyalty. They expect long hours with no compensation or a thank you and no guarantee you'll keep your job. There's no work-life balance, I've worked every federal holiday this year and most weekends. I've had to drop out of classes in school just to keep my job. Otherwise, I'd be let go if anything were to take precedence over my job. Since working at Broadcom, I can't hardly take a day off, I almost have to ask for weekends off. I'm constantly having to reschedule doctor appointments because I can't get a break to go. I can't remember what it's like to work an 8 hour day, I've worked mostly 12-16. They hate work from home, they also hate remote employees. Anything they can do to eliminate that, even if it means laying off the best guys on your team, they'll do it.
No communication from the top, management does not tell lower management or employees what they're thinking. Once they've made an instant, poorly thought out decision with no input from others, there's no changing it.

If you work in IT or software or hardware you can get paid well almost anywhere. Why stay at Broadcom when you can get money AND culture at another company?

To Gen Z or Millennial Americans culture matters a great deal. Create a culture that isn't all about numbers or money lest you lose the interest of the majority of qualified candidates.

Broadcom seems more about dividing up the clients into the ones that pay us a lot of money and the ones that do not and the service we provide is based on that. Obviously that is working for them because they are very successful. But it gives you a sense of not being able to really provide help to the clients that need it if their account is not big enough. But I listed this as a pro because the profits are passed on to the employees.

Fix the pay gap, equal pay for equal work. I get that new employees should start out lower than experienced ones, but if they perform well and work hard or harder than the experienced employees then let them be able to reach that same pay rate in a reasonable amount of time. I get very frustrated to see some operators work their butts off and getting paid 30% less than someone who does bare minimum just because they been in the business for 30 years. I'd like to keep the good employees around...but they could probably quit after a year and take that experience and negotiate better pay somewhere else.

I worked at Broadcom full-time for less than a year
Pros
None since we were quickly divested. Although I did have some CA stock that paid out well...
Cons
I was part of the CA acquisition and subsequent divestiture of services to HCL. We signed an agreement that would pay a bonus of 2 weeks for every month until we completed the divestiture. The closing of CA was November 5th and the divestiture was December 31st short of 2 full months so Broadcom only paid out the 2 weeks of bonus. Worst acquisition ever!

His approach is to purchase companies that have significant market share and profit then cut most the staff and sustain the current product until it no longer makes enough of a profit to warrant keeping it.

","No job security. Everyone is subject to layoff and replacement, everyone.

No work life balance. Work load keeps increasing each time they get rid of some people and spread the work to remaining folks.

No career path. CEO keeps organization very flat, which means there is a very short career ladder without many titles to climb. Moving up takes a really long time.

You won't feel any confidence about long term career path no matter how good you perform. There is no culture here, just cost cutting. You can only focus on surviving current year without getting laid off. This is design by intention so everybody keeps their head down in the same position year over year.

The performance ranking rule is as heartless as it can be. Every group is given a under perform quota to meet regardless of how the group performs. It forces managers to pick some folks as under performer even though they do not deserve such ranking. This system is designed to force people out year over year. It also makes rest of folks get less recognition from how good they actually perform.

Come work for Broadcom if you just want valuable stocks and don't care how long to stay. If you want a serious career path, seek somewhere else.

Why did they keep the brcm name? Because avgo is a company that never did anything ever. They made passive rf front end prodcuts and got financing to leech and acquire better companies and strip them down. The current Broadcom Inc is a Frankenstein or Zombie with no brains to eat. Don't ever work here

Mon May 07 2018, Engineer,"Irvine, CA",Former Employee ,Great company before the merger,4,"Pay and RSU’s are amazing and above average. You will earn a lot of money working here. I would ride it out until the toxicity gets to you and/or you are laid off
","Honestly I feel sad writing about this as I saw this company go from an innovative and inspiring work place to a toxic environment with constant finger pointing and backstabbing. Constant layoffs and fear of when you’ll get laid off makes working with others a pain. This looming fear makes sharing information and skills harder as it basically makes you disposable. People don’t want to help you as they might loose their jobs doing so. This causes you stay at work much longer and basically kills your work life balance. 

Hiring is non existent and the growth is artificial. It only grows as long as the CEO has companies to buy. You can see this on how the stock has been performing after the failed attempt to buy Qualcomm.
Advice to Management
Honestly this artificial growth will end. The company isn’t changing and with the current “reputation” that broadcom has will alienate high skilled engineers and workers from applying (if they could that is)

cost cutting 
Not everyone gets good bonuses. I think the way they assess people could be better. Could have some more events, but usually related to your specific group

spend more on R&D
Improve assement of contributions, and hold onto good people. Share the birthday peoples names on their birthday (at least if they are ok with it)! Its nice having celebration but weird that we don't know who for.

Think about more than just raw dollars and consider the extra time it takes for an employee to perform a task. Spending a few bucks to give him/her the tool they need will save thousands in short time.
