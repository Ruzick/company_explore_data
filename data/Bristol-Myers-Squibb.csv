","Too much politics and too little promotion. The things i accomplished, like running research on statistics problem, training interns, saving budget on outsourcing, completing dozens of deliveries all by myself, were not valued by management team. I was not promoted once for the 6 years been there. My boss (female) feel competitive from things i do. And wouldn't spent any time to develop me. She even kept me from transitioning to other groups. Because she can not find my replacement. She did promote male associates in her group. But eventually everyone left her. She still kept her job at the company though. Other manager in the stats department were not qualified to be a manager either. They either spend group budget to send their favorite to go non-essential business trip in first class. Or they contracted out project to CRO to receive kick back. i am glad Celgene is taken over by BMS. At least science and not look will be valued.

Listen to your employees and put them first and you won't see the large level of turnover. Since Frank Marra left the Reimbursement Organization- they have had 4 leadership changes. This speaks levels about a company and from what I have heard from friends. The Micromanagement from the Celgene acquisition is worse.

Mon Feb 17 2020,N/A,, ,"Another company that puts on a shiny outward appearance, but seems to be rotting from within.",2,"Good cafeteria. Here's a few more words.
","Employees are petty and backstabbing. Management does not involve employees when enacting changes, nor does management listen to the concerns and improvement suggestions of employees. Where supervisors/managers by all rights ought to be developing their employees and providing them what's needed to succeed in their roles, those responsibilities are shirked back onto employees themselves, usually without clear direction or supervision. For this reason it can take weeks to gain badge access to your area, and months to get your training ""plan"" accurate.

Full time jobs seem to be a thing of the past, so if you were hoping for benefits, keep looking. BMS only seems to bring on contract employees, and treats them like objects, at that. This is regardless of your experience, education, or expertise. In all cases but 1 that I've witnessed in my time here so far, an employee whose contract is about to expire receives NO INFORMATION from BMS nor the contract agency as to future intentions. The most anyone has gotten is lip service and brushed aside. Come the fateful day, the response it's always a surprise. In one case, the poor employee was not told until the last day that he should probably look for a new job.

Another was extended 6 months, on the last day; he was vocal about his needs for decent healthcare as he required medication, nearing the end of his career. He was a bit slow to learn the computerized systems, but was surely picking it up over the months. No matter, apparently... He was let go last week for reasons that dismay the team.

On the same day last week, another older gent was let go. He had just had his contract extended another 6 months. He was told in passing by someone other than his supervisor. Fast forward two weeks, and he's being let go for something that happened in December. Why string him along like that, with not even the respect to communicate with him?

If you're looking for a REAL job, I highly suggest looking elsewhere.

","Very hierarchical and set in traditions. The difference between PhDs and non-PhDs is strongly felt, likewise, chemistry vs. biology, immunology vs. cancer biology.

There have been restructurings over the last few years of various groups, the overall effect has been increased throughput of protein production and lead discovery, leading to faster development of biologics. Projects have been pared to focus on fewer, but higher priority targets.

Within the last year, benefits have been improved for all employees. Working hours are relatively flexible as people live and commute from around the bay area. The Redwood City site has been continually invested in and improved.
","Many of the mid-level managers are relatively new to their roles, which can be positive or negative depending on where you are in your career.

Finally after 12+ years I look forward to team building during lunches.Thank you. The outdoor BBQ stand is one of the greatest management technology innovation that the employees will be able to enjoy at the Redwood City site. Pat on the back. Lovely and exotic plants and trees have been planted in the newly paved parking lot. Very well thought out security gates. We finally have a sense of security for our cars parked in the parking lot. Very courteous security guards. Janitors maintain the facility with a lot of care and cleanliness. Womens toilet is always sparkling.
","I wish I could say that there is as much job security as the parking lot security. Hiring practices are highly questionable in Protein Therapeutics and Biologics Lead Discovery Group . Team members and collegues are not given the oppurtunity to participate in hiring decisions. The VP of the group covertly nods and hand picks select members in the hiring/interview team which causes bias in hiring.

","I’ve worked at BMS for several years now in several sites and several roles. All those roles were very satisfying, and I have had some excellent managers at BMS. When I first started, it was my dream job. 

After a series of leadership changes, I came to Devens, MA. The organization I joined lacks leadership. Hardworking, high performing employees are passed on for career opportunities and promotions. Several scientists in process sciences who published their science and made significant contributions left the company because they were passed on for promotional opportunities. The analytical sciences organization is a political nightmare, with the leadership expecting us to work like robots. As long as you pander to the agendas of different managers, the quality of work doesn’t matter. Mid level managers hire several contractors and do nothing. Harassment of women is common. There is no concrete leadership goals for the organization. When new employees who join from other companies in director level positions or above, we always anticipate positive changes. Unfortunately, they imbibe the negative culture of the leadership and let their good employees leave as well.

The attitude at BMS is a bit ""cult like"" it can seem a bit ""Stepford Wives"" at times. But there is a bigger/deeper problem which is upper management is led by outside consultants -- don't believe they would know what to do if they didn't have their outside consultants directing them.

Thu Apr 12 2018,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Poor Management,18,"Ice cream truck Wednesdays during the summer and summer hours. Excellent maternity leave policy. The company is a good company overall, but there are just certain departments that are big problems.
","People who work hard are continuously overlooked in favor of those employees who are buddies with senior management. People who do the absolute bare minimum are rewarded, while those who go the extra mile don't see it reflected in their annual review or bonus. Employees are aware of rating changes during review calibration that did not accurately reflect performance in order to benefit the ""favorites."" This seriously hurts morale and has a negative impact on retention. Retaliation is prevalent when complaints are made. 

Management doesn't do a good job communicating, so things tend to be all over the place and expectations can be confusing. Some managers dislike data sharing, meaning that groups often end up doing unnecessary work.

In addition, there are minimal opportunities to advance within the department (again, unless you have friends in high places).

Health insurance options are abysmal.

Science isn't valued as much as would be expected for a company that wants to be a leader in the industry. Many scientists present data without statistical analysis or duplicate experiments and tend to jump to conclusions.

Cuts to travel budgets mean fewer opportunities to go to conferences. Management has also called for a reduction in the employee recognition system ""Bravo,"" claiming that people are over-rewarded and aiming to reduce reward values for hard work.

BMS claims to strive for a culture of inclusivity, but kept on a senior employee after multiple complaints were filed for him harassing female employees. Female employees were instead moved.

3. Resources - Readily given resources to succeed at your job.
","1. Retention problem - current department has had a serious problem with loyalty within the department and company. Many people of a younger age are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere. There is no reward for loyalty.
2. Lack of incentives - The current system used to rate employee performance is very inaccurate. I can outperform my peers and at best see a 1-2% difference in salary+bonus at end of year. Being a high-perform does not mean you will get promotions.
3. Compensation - Complete lack of any bargaining or arguing your worth. You either take what they give you or you can walk.
4. Lack of Recognition - Management fully believes and supports a culture where saying ""Thank You"" is enough for going above and beyond what is normally expected of an employee. Bringing this up only brought an awkward conversation and a negative impact on my Behavior performance.

I have been working at Bristol Myers Squibb full-time
Pros
Friendly co- workers, benefits are decent, recently updated office areas
Cons
Constant upper and midlevel management turnover in the recent 3/4 years (Syracuse) results in extreme changes to culture and overall work environment. Most of the plant has changed to 12 hour shifts; work-life balance has quickly fallen wayside. Constant and sudden extreme changes in processes with minimal to no training results in major mistakes which lead to investigations, not problem solving. Departments are in silos; communication is minimal and people are constantly questioning the longevity of the plant. Most recently, seasoned employees had their positions reposted and were made to interview- resulting in being informed they no longer qualified. The days of retirement from this once esteemed company are over. Not many opportunities for advancement as the company focuses more on cutting out the fat and putting more work on already stressed employees. There's no gym, no daycare, and are now removing onsite dining facility.
Advice to Management

","Everything else. 

Working here is like being back in junior high school. Gossip, cliquey and rampant with politics. This is a ""good 'ol boys network"" at its worst. If you are not accepted into the fold, expect to be marginalized and ignored. It doesn't matter how productive you are, you will never get recognized for the work you do. Many layers of low and middle management means many opportunities for unprofessional conduct. 

Nothing here is confidential. You can expect your manager to openly discuss you performance reviews with other employees. You can expect your pay information to be divulged if a manager or supervisor thinks you make too much. If your not buddies with your manager, you will never be considered for promotion or advancement opportunities. If you reach an employee milestone (anniversary) and your manager doesn't like your choice for a celebration or who you invite, you can expect to be openly mocked for it. 

Supervisors and managers only care about themselves and their next promotion. God forbid you do or say anything that they think makes them look bad, you will suffer eternally for it. 

Senior Production management is a joke. Literally. As are some former team leads who insist on acting like BoBo the Clown.

","The workforce is overly lean relative to the consistent workload. There is little promotion from within. They seem to love others peoples talent more than their own. Internally, the road to promotion is political and managing perception vs doing work. In fact, they have recently laid off some of their most talented employees for seemingly political reasons. You are better off not delivering your best and passing the buck elsewhere to focus on your one or two visible project opportunities. The challenge is that this creates frustration and distrust. Also, the leaders are largely consumed with politics so they don't spend much time developing people and cultivating the next generation of employee. Those that focus more on employees are either marginalized or let go.

","Hard to progress career, especially if you are a woman. Company consistently invests in the wrong people for management - individuals with no people skills, diplomacy, tact. They are technically competent, but they can't manage people. Some are just out for their own careers. If you are female, you will start levels below male counterparts with same background and it's a hard hole to dig out of. You will also be paid less. You will have to fight to have your salary on particular with your male colleagues. And your male colleagues' careers will progress faster than yours because they will be given priority for prime opportunities. This is how management will justify progessing them and not you- even if you ask for the opportunity to do more/show more skills. Some managers are better than others, but most are pretty terrible. And most of upper management is just trying to deal with change and keep their own careers and power structures. They are pretty clueless how the people below them work, what work is being done, and who is working hard and who is coasting and collecting a check. If you can control your perception to upper management, you'll be fine, no matter how little you contribute.

Fri Jan 20 2017, Director,"Princeton, NJ",Former Employee ,A Once Great Company Now in A Death Spiral,22,"If I was asked a year ago to provide a list of ""Pros"" related to working for BMS, the list would have been extensive. My response to the same question today...not many ""Pros"" to working at BMS during this very tumultuous time of company transformation. We are hemorrhaging great talent and nobody seems to care as attrition is viewed as a mechanism to allow the company to achieve it's talent reduction targets. Having to watch so much talent and vibrant leadership walk (or be forced) out the door, I made the difficult decision to leave this sinking ship. But if you love shiny new ultramodern infrastructure, Princeton Pike may be a great place for you to work.
","-Staff reduction decisions being made with no regard for performance history or years of service. 
-Employees still standing are completely preoccupied with company transformation and trying to predict what the next round of changes will bring. This has led to a ""self-preservation"" mentality - people clamoring for non optimal roles that they think will offer them a level of job security.
-Company operating model has been turned upside down in the last year (thank-you BCG!). Poor communication and expectation setting around how to work in the new model. In short, WAY too much change in a short period of time.
-Over-reliance on a single asset - Opdivo. 
-Weak upper management driven to transform the company to be ""more competitive"" in the future, but in reality are dressing the company up for an acquisition.

","Massive amounts of uncertainty. Especially poor communication style of current CEO- who supposedly strives for transparency, but never really says anything except drops hints and causes massive amounts of unrest. Also, some concern about putting all eggs in one basket... and about whether they can stick to decisions made. Some high level management have very poor leadership skills, frenzied strategic vision, and even sketchy, blatant nepotism and favoritism. They say they care about career development but in many ares this seems HR lip service rather than truth. Especially as the close very productive sites and do virtually nothing for the people left behind.
Advice to Management
Understand that it doesn't help to be transparent if you are only dropping hints about what's to come without giving details. If people don't know how it will affect them, then you are leaving them guessing... and this hurts productivity. If you close a site, try not to let it drag out for years, you are playing with peoples lives and causing massive amounts of stress. You say you care about patients... but do you care about people? It is difficult to believe your message about patients when you treat your employees like chess pieces and jerk them around for years. The last year has taken a huge toll on the mental health of your employees.

I have been working at Bristol Myers Squibb full-time for more than a year
Pros
-Salary/Benefits/perks
-Location/commute
-Flex work schedules for some (not all)
-WDYWF? patient initiative
-Solid products; strong presence in the marketplace
-Key people with excellent leadership qualities and skills( people who are more than managers and understand the difference).
Cons
-Too many fast org changes this year have been disruptive
-Some areas need stronger leadership and management, as some managers are just ticking off requirements on checklists and are not really engaged with their subordinates
-Poor employee retention/constant turnover in some areas 
-Working with remote teams is a challenge (it's been over 18 months and I'm considering a move already). Sometimes a dysfunctional team is too entrenched and can not change for the better.

-Highly intelligent colleagues
-Hourly workers have the potential for overtime
-Reputable
","-Pay (as compared within the company) Professional levels and above seem to see much larger pay increases in both flat amounts and percentages, especially the bonuses (this statement is assumed with confidence)
Advice to Management
-I would tie pay, (and bonuses), of the uppermost management to the lowest paid employee such that the uppermost pay would not exceed 30 times what the lowest paid employee makes, but only if it could be applied across the whole nation otherwise we may end up discouraging top talent at the upper levels.

-I would also, rethink outsourcing. If we pay another company to do work that we routinely need done or depend on, because the outsource company is able to do it cheaper then I would question if that part of the company is running efficiently. Somewhat like, IF Toyota can come to the US, build cars for less, that are safer, more efficient, and / or last longer than US companies on our ""home turf"", then companies like GM should be asking why are we getting beat, instead of asking for government handouts or loans. If we as a company can't do the work needed more efficiently then by all means bring in someone else, but I would try to understand why we can't and not just leave it at, ""we are not in the ..... business, we are in the bio-pharma business.

Lastly I would consider stretching the working hours of the facilities for 2 reasons:
1 - to better accommodate working families work schedule.
2 - to accomplish more in the same 7 day week by minimizing wait times and optimizing functionality and overlap the same way people do by working from home and responding to e-mails at 8 or 9 pm so the person on the other end doesn't have to wait for that respondent to come in before getting a reply. 
The buildings and labs are already here being powered and cooled all seven days. If people are in them and are able to spread their 40+ hours of work, efficiently, over 80+ hours instead of ~55 hours more work can be accomplished with the right timing choices. 

 Instead of the typical 8-5 or 9-6, I would have the parts of the company that can be up and running open from 6 am until 8 pm. Mon. - Sat. I would ask that people still work their 40+ hours, I would just give them more time to do it in. This sort of schedule could help avoid traffic and work around weather issues like snow.
