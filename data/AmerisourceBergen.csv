IT ramp up for newbies is very good. IT Transition to remote for 2020/Covid was excellently delivered to whole enterprise.
","The IT organization ultimately reports to CFO (used to be to Legal) - so that tells you how important IT is to enterprise. Frequent “re-orgs” that never finish. Leadership is only at VP/above levels - so while they should drive much leadership, they do not leverage lower level management well at all. Much deference to VP/above. Culture says it wants honesty but continually acts to avoid it and coach towards getting along at all costs. A large amount of “yes” is said without followup/follow through. IT moving almost all sr leaders to Philadelphia and away from other larger IT offices, to the detriment of career progression/visibility elsewhere
Advice to Management
Get rid of Director level and have Managers report to VP’s. Aligns with how you treat the organization. Find real ways to promote people and make it happen instead of talking about it’s importance. Close remote IT offices if you want to stay focused in Philly. Reduce large reliance upon consulting companies and offshore - build employee knowledge and ownership within your company. Invest in US schools and bring talent in and groom.

So much depends on your department. I’m lucky enough to be in a good one, but I can see other teams that are ...not great. Company talks up the ‘we all contribute to performance’ line, but there’s a lot of unevenness of measurement. “Political” skill seems to be the main criteria for some senior leadership promotions, not actual leadership or results.

","Extremely Toxic Executive Management. While I've heard the phrase ""work place bullying""... for the first time in my 20 years of working in a corporate environment, I experienced it first hand. The lack of integrity , transparency, and trust I experienced in such a critical part of the organization was disheartening. (READ THE OTHER REVIEWS) 

Team player = Must be a yes man/woman

While the company townhall calls push for work life balance and self care, Sr Level Management will work you to the point of mental exhaustion, constantly reiterating; ""This is not a 9-5 company"". 

Asking for assistance with an unreasonable workload is translated as ""I am not experienced enough to perform my role responsibilities"" (That's until the regulators advise the same) 

While the company values displayed on the website is a ""good read"" DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT have the expectation of adherence within the Risk & Conpliance Business Areas. 

- Open door Policy... Don't even bother 
- Upper Management will take credit for hard work performed by direct reports, however lacks the ability to take ownership when he/she is the point of failure. 

Opportunities for career advancement, innovation are selling point (lips service) in the interview process, don't count on it.

","A lot of favoritism going on there especially in manual pick department. I worked in the Chicago , Romeoville office as a full time associate and those supervisors in manual pick are terrible. No matter how hard you work, they only favor those who speaks Spanish since almost all those supervisors are Hispanic. The annoying part is when the day’s work is over, they will ask us to clean for hours instead of allowing us to go home and prepare for the next day’s work. They expect us to work like donkeys. Due to this, they have a lot of turnovers.
Advice to Management
Management should sit up and eradicate this favoritisms going on or they will continue to have high turnovers. They should also advice supervisors especially manual pick to reduce the time for that cleaning, at least 10minutes of cleaning is enough since associates are expected to clean as they work. There’s no need cleaning for hours after a hard day’s work. One thing management can do to reduce the high turnover rate at the warehouse is to introduce voluntary overtime which will always ask associates who are interested to work overtime to clean instead of this mandatory cleaning. Most associates who left like me complained of the same things I mentioned. Some people signed up for just the work, cleaning was not part of the job it should be overtime for those who volunteer. Allow associates to go home and rest for the next day instead of asking them to clean for hours, that’s ridiculous.

","When I first started at the company, it was pretty decent. We had upper management that knew what they were doing. We had metrics that were normal and reasonable. 
Of course those people were fired and replaced with people who are...well...much less than stellar.
Constant changes in rules and metrics without giving them a chance to pan out. They could not agree on a QA rubric to save their lives, for example. 
They claimed they cared about our customers and their patients, however they would penalize you for actually taking the time to solve customer issues. There are reps there who only take inbound calls but do nothing the customer asked- probably because they're fearful it will impact their average handle time (AHT). Yet curiously we didn't even have metrics when I left, apart from QA. So how can someone be held to a standard like AHT when there is NO standard?
Unless you are a favorite, or they have to hire you for the sake of affirmative action, do not expect to get promoted or shown much mercy or favor. 
There are backstabbing supervisors there and some coworkers are the same.
Advice to Management
One customer we acquired told me, ""Everything Amerisourcebergen touches it destroys.""
I happen to agree. I really feel sorry for our customers because they are not provided the support they need.
Some of the supervisors are immature and unprofessional. There were things I heard about them that were unethical and disgraceful.
The company is run by two-faced people who talk a good talk about being patient-minded, yet allegedly run a racket - hence all the opioid litigation. 
I know the future is not bright for this company.

","This place is a competitive job with literally everyone working against you. Management is down right abusive to employees. You can’t go to HR about it because they will always take managements side and tell you that you are the problem even to blatant harassment. If you are injured on the job they will not give you workman’s comp and just fire you for not coming to work due to an injury. The company does have an incentive program but management adjusts incentive of the employees however they feel like. The company also lost almost 850 million in lawsuits and within the year lowered raises, 401k matching, gave worse insurance, and lowered incentive numbers, while bragging they had great return on investments for shareholders. If this wasn’t bad enough the day shift and night shift hate each other for no reason to the point where both shifts try and sabotage the other shift by not doing work. It even got so bad at one point where one shift was taping razor blades to shelves to cut other employees. That is not a joke. That is how messed up this place is.

","Management doesn’t care about their employees. They are only out for themselves. They will screw you over by withholding the money that you earned in selling. They micromanage, dictate, and set unrealistic demands. There has been times where they never follow through with rewarding winners after setting up a contest or spiffs.

Advice to Management
I really tried liking this job, I'm a top performer. The pay is good and the benefits are okay but the management are ridiculous and have no idea what they're doing. They'll lie to you, talk down to you, play games with you, tell confidential information about you in group meetings with other coworkers. Theres a reason they cant keep anyone and everyone quits. And if you talk to anyone about maybe changing how something is done because its ineffective or can be improved upon they throw your ideas out the window and continue the old way. Then write you up from deviating from an sop that was constructed probably when the company first opened. Management has zero idea how to do your job and its really up to your coworkers to train you. And because they cant keep anyone because management is toxic you usually work 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week because your shift ends when the work load is completed. 

Highly unprofessional environment with people who lied on their resumes to get into management positions.

When I first started, it was just Lash Group and they had not incorporated Amerisource Bergen just yet, even though it was already a done deal by then. Lash Group was a warm and inviting place to work. The first fortune 500 company I worked for that wasn't ""corporate"". With the number of managers that was ever so present, I've never met so many down to earth managers all in one place. Lash Group was so great they even had a resource to help you with your kids. A very kid friendly work environment. But..... As Amerisource Bergen started to take over, things changed. see cons for the rest of my story
","Well like I was saying... AB came in and things started to change. I think what was one of the hardest hits was the kids... AB doesn't want anything to do with them. Like it was the plague. So you can really understand what I'm getting at, check this. I would say, at least 60% of the employees are Afro-American woman. and a great number of that 60% has kids. So when you had an emergency and did not have someone to babysit, it was nothing to bring them to work. Hell, they had toys and puzzles and game to keep them busy while you work. To me, that's what made it a company I wanted to work for. That and they pay well. It has changed. Now it's AB/LG. Totally corporate. Not bad, but it changed.

Why would a company invest all the time and effort for on-boarding a new employee, do the training, pay them benefits, give them a laptop, desk, etc and then only give 90 days - this is just bad business all around and fosters bad morale. It takes a little more time than that to get used to a job and develop and nurture relationships with clients. Stop hiring so many people if you know the majority of them will not last. Change the metrics so they can support stability in the sales dept. Supervisors are frequently hostile and behave in inappropriate ways such as discussing reps being fired with staff before that rep is even aware, discussing their metrics with ""favorites"" and just out right gossiping. Very similar to middle school. After reading other reviews (Bellco Generics) it's amazing how this company is still getting away with these unethical tactics . Where is HR in all this mess?

The unexpected mandatory overtime 
You get a “tardy” for everything it seems like
There’s no understanding if you can not stay for the mandatory overtime

Strict attendance (and although I understand why but with the attendance being so strict it makes people have more call offs after their 90 days are over with) which means more work for the people that didn’t call off which could result in mandatory overtime 

Some shifts are told mandatory overtime while other shifts get to go home. For example, I work 11pm to 730am there is a shift that works 10pm to 630am. One night that shift was able to leave at 630am and at 645am they made my shift and the other shifts after me stay mandatory 1 or 2 hrs overtime. Which wasn’t fair 

They raised the pay to compete against “competition” but also provided us with more hrs added more vendors and there’s not enough space 

Also, the incentive is horrible as far as bonus 

The turn over rate is high they can not keep people 

I could go on and on to be honest....
Advice to Management
There needs to be a work/life balance. If I’m putting in 12-14 hrs in my job there needs to be some understanding that we all have a life and people has kids. Not everyone will stay just because of the pay which is probably why AmerisourceBergen can not keep people.

","No work/life balance at all. Multiple surprise 12-15 hour shifts on a weekly basis. No warning for the overtime, you just are forced to stay until all the work is done in all departments. If your department somehow finishes their work at a decent time (within 10-12 hours) you will more than likely not be able to leave as you will be sent to other departments to help them. Mandatory weekend shifts happen much more regularly than they would like to admit. Upper management (above supervisors and leads) have no issue with keeping employees over 12 hours a day, and in fact become upset if employees try to leave after a 12.5 hour day. Supervisors are blatantly abused with extreme amounts of overtime. Pay is menial, although the bonuses do help.

","Worst management that could possibly exist.

HR will lie to you and say that pay is competitive, it's not.

Micromanagement. Middle management is too thick. There are as many workers as there are managers except managers don't do any of the true work; they just tell the employees to do the work that they already know to be doing.

Fat middle management segments create roles where no roles need to be, redundant roles, meanwhile not enough workers to actually do the work.

If you don't drink the corporate kool-aid then you will be reprimanded for not caring enough about other departments of the company, even if they don't pertain to your department.

Management will not give warnings. I have been a faithful employee and slipped up once. And for the next two weeks I had evidence trumped up against me that was fabricated, and had my job threatened daily. 

They will threaten your job out of the blue as a motivational technique.

Work environment created by management is unhealthy and hostile.

Conflicting priorities given by the tens of thousands of different ""bosses"" that you have will inevitably cause you to forsake one priority for another, and then you will be yelled at by the managers who's requests you put on hold for the other manager.

Complaining culture from tenured employees fosters in this pseudo-busyness whereby employees can fake being busy and shirk their workload onto new employees.

Give preferential treatment to minorities and women because of PC culture/fear of backlash. Management eats up the concerns of the aforementioned groups with a spoon.

Our 2017 performance goals that started on October 1st 2016 (beginning of fiscal year) have not been delivered by our management team as today's date. That equates to 7 months 24 days without performance goals. No indication on when they will be delivered. No accountability held again against management for this issue.

","Hard work gets you absolutely nowhere in this specific warehouse. I worked in manual pick for 2 years and I'm not ashamed to say that the other departments in the building are treated like garbage. They drive hard workers out of the building and want people who know the minimum and won't cause any ""problems"". You are moved up based solely on personal relationships and if you ever challenge management (on some of the most ridiculous things) you will be blackballed and targeted. Supervisors are constantly bad mouthing their employees and the woman in charge has no clue what she is doing. Trying to explain something to her is like talking to a brick wall, she has no knowledge of the job and attempts to micromanage EVERYTHING. The management does not care about their employees whatsoever, they only care about not being sued. If an employee calls HR on them, they ban together to ""have each other's back"" and sit in their office with the HR rep and try to guess what employee called. The sexual harassment in the building is off the charts, and the disrespect is unbelievable. Everyone in the building is too afraid to step up and attempt to make a change because everyone who has before them has either been fired or will remain in their same position until they're fired or quit. They will take credit for your ideas and hard work and put the blame on you when things are going south. From what I've seen/heard the only person who seems to connect/care about his employees is the shipping supervisor. He is consistently mentioned in surveys and reviews for being a good supervisor and they try to punish him for it. This is a terrible place to work and will remain that way as long as the people who are in charge, are in charge.
Advice to Management
Move people up based on their hard work and dedication. Stop deciding who you're going to hire before you give people the opportunity to apply. Wipe management clean and replace them with people who are not out for themselves, not corrupt, care about their employees and (in the managers case) have any knowledge of the job at all. I truly hope someone does an investigation on this place, leaving it behind is the best decision I've ever made.

","No work life balance.
Over the last few years, they continue to lay people off and downsize departments or not hire additional personnel, yet increasing the amount of workloads of the people who are still with the company. 
Due to this, working unpaid overtime (as most people are paid salaries) and weekends has become mandatory to meet project deadlines set by management. 
Along with this mindset, they have shown that they do not have loyalty to their employees and will lay them off to be a scapegoat or help their bottom line.
Because of this, the employees that have not left are stressed and are becoming burnt out.

","Management within User Services is appalling. New hires are provided inadequate training before being thrown into the fire. Management never makes the necessary tools to complete the job available, technicians are constantly scrambling to share the one login credential between the 15 or so technicians. Management also won’t provide any information in regards to fixing new issues that may arise, unless you do something for them, such as pick up a weekend shift or fill in for more overtime. It is also a necessity that technician’s matchup their pay stubs to their timecards. Management consistently performs overrides to remove overtime from timecards, without any legitimate explanation of why. When confronted supervisors blame the technicians for not clocking out when that same supervisor was the one that forced the technician to work the overtime, to begin with. 
Many of the company events such as holiday parties, technicians are strictly told not to attend and that they are for the rest of the company and not for them. Throughout the year technicians are told by User Services management not to engage in conversation with individuals in other departments because those individuals are much too important and too busy to be bothered. Technicians also do not enjoy many of the company-wide perks such as being off on certain non-federal holidays, or half-day Fridays in the summer, that other departments receive. Being a call center environment this is understandable, but you would think management would provide some other alternative like a time and a half pay rate or floating days off. Management does not care about the concerns of employees. Representatives are constantly told to their face that they are expendable. HR has to be aware of the high turnover rate within the department (literally all through quitting), yet nothing is done about management.

Weekends are always off which is a great bonus for a lot of us. Only when system issues arise does the call volume shoot up. More often than not it's an average of 2-3 minutes per call. The main thing we are responsible for is checking stock on available items and reaching to confirm availability.Sometimes depending on the time of your shift, you may not get a call for a good 10 minutes. This allows a lot of downtime to work on other tasks or even browse the web. (within reason). They do believe in their employees and offer great incentives like awards for providing excellent service and going above and beyond. Also, the equipment is decent (at times slow) but more so it's nice and the workspace is nice, clean and efficient. Large food area and majority of the time there is a food truck out on the lot to eat from. They now offer hour lunches (adds 30 minutes to either the beginning or end of your set schedule) Workforce Management chooses this, unfortunately you cannot however it's way better and offers more flexibility throughout the day. Also most of the supervisors are down to earth and friendly. Senior management on sight has gotten the hint to be more receptive and offer more flexibility to the agents. This is huge compared to how it was when I first started over a year ago.
","I find the most difficult things to deal with are at times are dealing with situations where there was a lack of follow-through by the previous agent who may have assisted a customer. At times this can get stressful because a representative didn't leave clear notes or sometimes management may not have caught a process issue. 
This career doesn't play around with tardies. 1 minute late, is considered a tardy so timeliness is key for your success at AmerisourceBergen. 
Management (including call center supervisors) are held to a different standard compared to the call center CARE representatives. (This is apparent when it comes to how AmerisourceBergen disciplines it's associates compared to how they ""manage"" their supervisors. 
Across the organization there's been what they've been calling it as ""restructuring"" which to them is better term that they use instead of just saying layoffs. Fortunately the CARE team isn't affected however it does change the level of security for advancements within this facility. I don't see where I could truly grow in this environment which is why I'm looking for better opportunity. If they offered it I'd probably be more inclined to stay.
Advice to Management
Work on being more diligent with how supervisors are managed. At times, I'd question the accountability that is placed on them. Supervisors can stroll in minutes late on a day to day basis where as CARE reps wouldn't even be allowed to do that. We'd be out of jobs. Also we had some supervisors who specifically ran reports to catch tardies that were not caught within a specific time. (ahem 6-7 months prior). To me this was HIGHLY petty. At one point you couldn't stop this supervisor for letting people go for tardies but now that there is more leniency, majority of the people are leaving the facility for something greater. Also, hold the supervisors to the same level of accountability that CARE reps are held too.

We have a few associates that think it's their place to stir up drama, lie, make up stories about things they don't know, assume and when a process is put in place for the company to move in a better direction the same employees makes it impossible for others to see the new leaf. 

You are hired to do a job, if you don't like the job then quit it.

","This office can burry you in paper. Many reports are printed and handed out to employees when they could simply send spread sheets via email. There area a few known employees that tend not to pull their weight and cost the company time and resources when their errors need correcting. This small group seems to be protected by their seniority despite their sloppy performances. Change can be difficult to make. Senior management tends to be closed off to altering processes leading to the use of antiquated time consuming tasks.
Advice to Management
There are opportunities within the office to ""trim the fat"". Employees should perhaps have their performance records evaluated to determine the value they bring to the company. Paper use could be cut down to save cost. An environment more nurturing to improvement suggestions may lead to more time saving and cost cutting opportunities.

It is generally a laid back environment. You learn a lot about specialty drug realm.
","There is a GREAT lack of communication between operations. 
You are not promoted based on your work ethic or experience or great ideas to improve company to drive business efficiently. They want people essentially who are ""yes"" men and women, whom don't like to step on other's toes. This is a business. In order to run a business successfully, there are bound to be toes that will be stepped on. Learn that it isn't a personal attack; only improvisation so employees that are driven to be the best they can be, which only promotes growth for the company. You will learn a great deal as to how to cover yourself, if you don't already know. The managers claim to have meetings with other teams regarding process changes and business acquisitions; however, pertinent information that will make the coordinators job easier and more efficient, is not relayed to the coordinator. It's more of 
who's at whom's desk, which in turn, does nothing. Morale would be better if we ran more like a well oiled machine, not the Titanic, after it hits the iceburg. There is always a knee jerk reaction when managers who have not done what needs to be done and the problem is out of control, which again, make the coordinators suffer. Also, you have intelligent coordinators; listen to their ideas and implement them. Most of the supervisors are on the defense, because they are not doing their job well and their coordinators go to them with their concerns or questions. US Bioservices is run more as a ""mom and pop"" shop pharmacy and that simply does not fly. At times, it seems as though supervisors and/or managers are intimidated by coordinators who happen to be very intelligent and they know it, but don't want their positions put into jeopardy. Those employees that do go to HR fortheir concerns regarding management, or lack thereof, often times are retaliated against and deemed as ""troublemakers"". This must stop.
Advice to Management
My advice to management is to please, please, please, listen to your employees that have worked in other pharmacies and for pharmacy benefit management companies, that have multi-faceted ideas that will improve job functions and let us prosper as a company. Promote those individuals that truly deserve it and whose work shows for it day in and day out; not those individuals whom just happened to know the supervisor or director but work ethic is severely lacking. Quit blackballing key people that will help the pharmacy thrive. You have quality employees that deserve chances. Our upper level management needs to take a look at whom they have in ""charge"". Most of them do not need to be in supervisor or lead roles. Also, acknowledge EVERY employee that receives compliments from internal and external parties; not just those that are on your list of ""favorites"". If this is done more often, morale would be a little higher. Also, mid level managment needs to severely work on communication and delegating work accordingly and not just at the last minute. All that does is cause unnecessary stress that can be avoided.

Too many acquisitions without the right support or staff in place to accomplish goals/tasks. No consideration of your own goals/aspirations, they would shuffle you around and from team to team at a moments notice with no support or training. The lack of sufficient training is rampant from the top to the bottom. NO HR ON SITE when there are 150+ people working in a building. HR shows up once every other Friday for a few hours.

Tue Feb 23 2016,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Financial Analyst,0,"The people: Employees at ABC are very kind and open-minded. As a newer employee, associates at all levels (even senior managers and executives) are very open and willing to answer questions. They want you to learn, and they realize there is a huge learning curve. It's a very empowering work environment, and they let you go at your own pace. 

There is a huge push for millennial workers, and the company is eager to know how they can cater to the millennial workforce. With that being said, work/life balance is great. They are continuously trying to improve this balance, as well.

The pay is satisfying, as well as bonuses, benefits, and the 401k. I was offered more than I was expecting when I was offered the job. From talks around the department, though, it's definitely an entry-level salary for the company.

The company is growing rapidly and is fairly large already (Fortune 16). However, it is still being operated as if it were still a small company. There is a lot of opportunity for process improvements, developing training programs, and other projects. You can literally play a part in a huge change that the company goes through for these reasons. Exposure is huge.
","Honestly, I can't think of anything negative to say about the company as a whole. The only thing I would mention is that the benefits and 401k do not start on day one of employment. They start after a full 30 days beginning on the first of the month after you are hired. Tuition reimbursement is a little over $5,000 a year.

Pros
Strong, intelligent and thoughtful leadership(mostly). The organization is positioned very well for continued growth and success.
Cons
HR has way too much influence over decisions that should not concern them. The head of hr is more concerned with her own agenda than what is best for the company and employees. Lots of turnover. It's time for new leadership and fresh ideas in that group. Managers need to have more input and control over their teams. 

Business processes are cumbersome and not intuitive.

You are never left alone - a mentor, a boss, a buddy is always there to help you get what you need to succeed. The only way to fail is to literally not try at all! 

Compensation is market level, the 401k is good, and the benefits package is great. Any doctor or dentist will tell you that your plan is excellent!

Work-life balance is a high-priority, but there are times you must grind out the 50/60/70 hour week. This is very team-dependent, but for every long and hard week there is the occasional long team lunch, early Friday, and and standard 40 hours.

Senior management varies depending on person and department, but most people are very passionate about both ABC and developing their teams. There is a common saying that ""harsh bosses do not last long at ABC"" because of the culture of respect. 

You will be hard pressed to find better culture and values at any company. Respect and fairness is found at all levels. Truly, we do shape healthcare for our customers, and help get patients the medication they need at a price they can afford.

In short - WORK HERE. ABC is an excellent company.
","Compensation could always be a bit higher, 401k matching could be a little higher. 

There is no real cafeteria, but instead there are vendors that bring food... While most people love the Chikafila vendor, it would be nice to have a real cafeteria with some hot foods available for breakfast and lunch.

Not every team has a great work-life balance, especially short-staffed IT teams. It would not hurt to identify overworked teams and hire another employee to share the load.

In short - our problems are minor, and will likely be addressed due to very receptive management... again, WORK HERE.

I have a BA degree. I voiced to my manager that I would like to develop into a new area in my career and he was excited at first to help me get there. After finding the area I wanted to move to within my department he promised to arrange mentor meetings and to get the ball rolling. He never set-up the meetings, never spoke about the transition or ways to prepare me for the transition after that. The company would rather hire Interns than to promote from within. It's really the luck of the draw sometimes. Early on I reported to a VP that was moving me into a better position. He was let go from the company and I have never had any similar support since then.

I have been working at AmerisourceBergen full-time
Pros
As many have posted, there are absolutely no accolades with which to grace AmerisourceBergen or anyone in a senior leadership role.
Cons
This is the type of company that you run away from, make an appointment with a therapist, and undergo years of therapy to recover from what you have been put through. 

Our compensation packages are market bottom; bottom of the barrel scraping poor. We cannot recruit any real talent with these salaries so we end up hiring the worst of the worst. We end up with new hires that have absolutely zero leadership skills, no chance of ever becoming leaders, yet think that the adolescent attitude that got them through high school will prevail in the corporate world. In 4 years, I have lost all of my top performers. You should see what I am left with and what I can afford to hire! 

Make no mistake, the company is making money. But it is being bled dry by senior leadership. We all see the articles in the news where $2.4 billion went to buy back company shares and the next day our CEO sold over 20,000 of his company granted stock options. That's were the money is going. It is certainly not going into my business unit's budget! Simultaneously, our bonus goals are close to impossible to achieve. Good luck reaching your 40% bonus goal under these conditions! We can't motivate or engage a single associate when the company is making billions yet is being run down into a flea market type of environment. 

If you have any hopes of career advancement, keep on dreaming. The only way to advance within the current state of organizational dysfunction, is to be friends with someone who can promote you or to be part of the in crowd. You will not be promoted on experience, merit, education, or hard work. None of that matters when we are all insulating ourselves with our friends to ensure that we will never be threatened by someone more competent or knowledgeable. You will only reach the point that we allow you to reach. Yes, I am guilty of that practice. But in this internal environment, that is the reality and the practice. 

Not convinced yet? Then some much needed perspective follows. Look at our top competitor's website; also, look at their GlassDoor site. Notice how they are an employee centered company? Notice how they portray themselves in the corporate world completely different than AmerisourceBergen? Read their GlassDoor reviews. The differences should tell you a lot. If you are internal to the organization, take a look at our Vision, Mission, and Values. There's nothing in there about you, about providing you with a world class working environment. It is all geared towards making that last buck.

","( I would give negative stars if I could!) 

You will need all 4 weeks of the time off in order to recuperate from the long hours ( 10 - 13 hr days if you work 8 hour shifts and 12 -14.5 hours if you are on the 4 day a week 10 hour shift) and mental exhaustion you will experience here. you will see explicit favoritism and may be bullied in front of your coworkers by supervisors. your HIPPA rights are violated by supervisors telling your medical issues to your coworkers when you miss work and HR will take the supervisors side against you. You can be falling down with fever and supervisors will walk past and ask ""are we having fun yet?"" even when it is obvious that you are extremely unwell. Your coworkers will be the ones to watch to make sure you dont collapse even after they have reported to a supervisor that you are very sick. Then when the you can no longer stand and you DO collapse your coworkers will carry you out of the warehouse. You will not be safe to drive home but you just hope you make it.

When they add more and more work you will suffer exhaustion and sleep depravity. likely to have accidents or make errors and since this is a pharmaceutical warehouse you have to make 99.97% accuracy.... We were told that fatigue was ""NO EXCUSE FOR ERRORS!"" ( Unless your supervisor likes you ALOT *wink, wink* , then you can make all you like and you will never be written up) There was a man that had a heart attack when i was there but didnt want to leave to go to the hospital because he didnt want to get points on hos attendence (It was MONDAY!! 5Thats POINTS!) there was another man taken out of there on two different occasions from exhaustion ( he typically worked 60 hours per week) a lady had a head-on collision after several 14 hour days and she had told people she was feeling unsafe to drive. 

you will be screwed out of almost every bonus..you can work longer hours and the work load will double and they will still say you didnt make the projectated goals... goals set so high they know you wont make them. and then they will tell you that its isnt your fault...the goals were over estimated , that clients who said they were going to sign decided not to and other clients left the company. so it wasnt your fault, ( and it wasnt, there was NOTHING you could have done to in anyway make a difference in this)---but they still arent giving you your bonus.

This is a pharmacutical warehouse and your day is not over until the last box is on the last truck. do not think you have a ""quitting time"". you will stay until they allow you to leave so you best have a babysitter that lives with you.

All around, a vague answer has left you still wondering whether you did what you were supposed to or if you're going to get an email sometime down the road stating you are subject to corrective action because someone complained on you in a passive aggressive way and you will never know who did it or what was said.
Advice to Management
Collaborate more with the team on a daily basis to get an overview of what goes on in the department. I would definitely suggest that if you are a manager and your friend is needing a job, do not put them in the same department with the friend as the lead. They will do whatever they want (including not work) and nothing will happen to them.

There was a big problem with managers hiring personal friends, giving friends the best projects and professional education opportunities (when space was limited), and then promoting those friends to higher positions with better pay over staff with more related experience and higher performance. HR and Sr Management did little address employees' concerns over promotion practices, despite repeated complaints.
