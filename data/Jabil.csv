Benefits are okayish (much lesser than many other companies around in the bay area) because you'd be enrolled in the Jabil payroll.
","I worked at Jabil Fremont for almost a year.
The entire company was an earlier mom & pop shop which became something big and was bought by Jabil. Most of the ""True Tech"" employees (earlier name of the company) even after 1 year of the merger are still the same and the culture has not changed even a bit. Each employee is a relative of one or the other person which would be on higher positions. Being said this, if something goes wrong, each relative would stand for someone else and the person not having any contact would be the scapegoat. Complaints, even if heard by any personnel or HR, would just see the trash bin and nothing would happen except the complainer's name would be out and everyone would know, who complained about whom which might turn out to be very bad. 
The company management tends to micro-manage each second (at least in the team I was a part of). My manager would treat his team as more like slaves rather than respecting respective engineers and his subordinates. Upper management thinks as if they are the owners of the company and can do any and everything. Hardly you would get any credits for any good work, because management would take that and you would be bashed even for the work you are not responsible for, if things go bad (specially if you are newcomer and you don't have connections).
[Additional points:- I was asked on the day of orientation 1st day of my work as why did I decide to join this terrible company and if I had some other options, then to choose that.... should have listened to him :( ]

This being said, there are few handful employees which are very good and supportive which would guide you and help for your growth and betterment. If you are in that team, you are lucky.
Advice to Management
Try to get rid of the older management who thinks they are the owners, try to get new personnel (specially not all who have one or the other connections/relative bonding internally). Hire good leaders rather than the bosses who do not guide but just delegate each and every work while they sleep sometimes.
HR team is terrible and would talk to their 'relatives' about some complaints of one personnel which should be confidential. They would not even try to understand the concerns but would create more problems for the employees. Maybe look for some non-connected HR personnel at a hire position who has some power.
Not even sure if Jabil (HQ) knows about any of these issues and if they know, it didn't seem like they were doing anything about this, maybe look into this.

Wed May 13 2020, Engineer,"Saint Petersburg Beach, FL",Current Employee ,Explore all options thoroughly before landing here!,5,"Diversity of projects without building expertise in a single domain (if that is desired).
","Management - The St. Petersburg healthcare design group is run under a mob mentality with zero transparency and accountability for unilateral actions taken by the site director and the supporting managers without balancing employee concerns and fears. During project bids for instance, estimates on scope and labor from experienced senior engineers are ignored in favor of underbidding quotes and winning projects. This detrimental practice catches up very quickly as it is realized during successive engineering phases from engineering design test (EDT), engineering verification test (EVT) and design verification test (DVT) that there was a gross misalignment in the original quotations which is misaligned with the customers' expectations. This results in issuance of contract change orders at repeated intervals to the consternation of the customers. And although senior engineers feel vindicated when this happens, they are left overwhelmed with the ""I told you so"" syndrome. 
Lack of Career Opportunities - Overall, there is lack of youth, women and minorities in the design center with these scarcities exacerbated particularly at management levels. Contractors are also predominantly older (>50 years) white men who are brought in mainly on the basis of their years of work experience regardless of how relevant that work is to the given project’s resourcing needs. A further downside of this practice is that junior engineers are almost never given more responsibilities thereby enabling them to successively prove they are eventually promotion worthy. To this end, the lack of promotions even for the most senior engineering staff based on exemplary performance reviews are held back and blamed on HR and other bureaucratic factors by the management. The company executive officers including the CEOs of Jabil Inc. and Jabil Healthcare keep touting the role of women and its importance within the company. However, the hiring practices run counter to these lip services, as within the engineering staff, women are not sought out or hired for roles in systems, electromechanical or software functions. 
Lack of Transparency - This is especially evident when it comes to how bonuses are given out. Employees are provided only with a rough sketch of their annual performance evaluations and told that they will receive a writeup informing them of their annual bonus payout. A couple of months go by and this writeup is not received. Eventually a payout is made; however, management or HR will not bother to explain the breakdown of the payout with respect to the management-based objective (or MBO) targets for the fiscal year. HR overall is absent from interactions with employees when it comes to face time or even generic email communications with respect to employee's growth, development or understanding of ongoing concerns with respect to management. Many of us still do not know who our group's HR representative is. 
Facility - The healthcare group was moved to the single-story Jabil Innovation Center (JIC) about a year ago. The facility was already overfilled and employs an open layout devoid of cubicles which is extremely disruptive to performing quiet and cohesive deep analytical work. Further, this facility is not equipped with security staff and front desk greeting staff thereby heightening security and medical risks for several employees. Parking is extremely limited with people having to park off site during customer visits which are more frequent lately. 
The above inconveniences along with healthcare management's abuse of power and continuous disregard for transparency in many work facets have led to significant declines in employee welfare and morale.
Advice to Management
My advice to the executive management is to not overlook the abuses of power that are currently undertaken at lower management levels within the company in the face of the higher than normal share values (which are on the decline at present owing to the coronavirus pandemic). 
Scrutinize the practices of this St. Petersburg healthcare design center, particularly the behavior of the site director and his supporting staff when it comes to bidding on projects, appropriately utilizing engineering resources, hiring practices, discrimination against women, holding back promotions and ignoring security, safety and working environment concerns of current employees. Further, get HR involved by taking an interest in the development of engineering staff members to enable fair growth and upward mobility in senior management positions. HR should be a resource available to all and not just those titled Directors or Senior Directors and above.

- Long term employees who have grown to leadership levels are too comfortable and egos fly high. Sharing ideas openly or showing leadership can be problematic as they can come back at you badly because of insecurity. This was a big cultural surprise.
- No guidance on how to navigate the structure and be successful. Seems there are too many clicks within the org and they seems to cover for each others with the only goal of saving their own jobs and pleasing their bosses.. How will the firm grow otherwise ?

","Managers were unbelievably bad. I don't intimidate easily, and I quit after 4 months because I felt intimidated. 

Was hired as an engineer and was only ever given manual labor to do. The big boss saw me checking the time on my phone and called me in for review on my first day. Had to furnish my own tools for this job, to do the manual labor, I did 12 hours a day, as an engineer... so bad it's confusing... Shop was horribly disorganized, and managers made us pretend to build robots for made-up customers when corporate came around. When I was actually being productive, bad project management meant that a job I was told to finish in 2 weeks would take 4 or 6 despite 12 hour days + Saturday. I'd complete a work-cell in a week and a manager would come tear it down to work on ""software"" or something while I was working on something else. Then I'd get in trouble. All the while the boss would talk about Steve Jobs and how hard he worked. 

Unsafe working conditions like lifting you up 30 feet on a forklift with no harness to pull down heavy equipment so we could pretend to build robots for fake customers. I nearly died. 

 This place is the most ridiculously unprofessional employer I've ever had in 15 years working full time. Randomly received a paycheck 6 months after quitting, for like $100 or something. Still receiving medical, dental, vision, and retirement benefits 3 years after quitting, in spite of several calls and emails to HR. I suspect they never took me off the books.

Occasional inexpensive employee events (Tiger Opening Day, Halloween party)
If you're friends with a manager, you can get hired for just about any job - usually some type of supervisor - with zero experience and you can be practically brain-dead. Great opportunity for people with no other career options.
Great place to get experience right out of college for a year or two - but then you better bail out! Let yourself be used and abused for a couple of years (trial by fire) and then take that experience, the cache' of the Jabil name, and go get a job at a reputable company paying 25% more than Jabil.
","As soooo many other people have posted - this is SUCH a good ol' boys club! It's truly about who you know not what your qualifications are, for getting hired or promoted. It's a little disgusting. Unless you're ready to kiss the butts of some of the managers and fawn all over them, you'll never get ahead. 
During my time here, I've had no opportunities for promotion, but I've seen plenty of butt-kissers get promoted. The problem is that I know my field and Jabil doesn't want people who know their field - they want people who suck up.
Pay has been below market, but Jabil takes advantage of their ""big name"" to pay less than the going rate, and the economy's too good right now to work for a company that's as cheap as Jabil when you can get a job paying way more just about anyplace.
Training is non-existent.
Don't believe the ""work hard, play hard"" nonsense managers spout. Maybe that was Jabil 25 years ago, but it doesn't reflect today's reality. Today's reality is ""work hard, then work harder, then get laid off.""
Advice to Management
If you expect your employees to be loyal to the company, then you should be loyal to your employees. There's too much ""off with their heads!"" mentality within Jabil. Goals and expectations are very short-sighted and you don't take into consideration the need to occasionally invest in employees' training and preparation for a better position. Instead of preparing existing employees for promotion, managers typically just hire one of their buddies who is jobless and desperate - and then they make them a ""manager"". You should invest in your employees so they will invest their time and commit their resources and faith in the company.

Sun Nov 09 2014,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,"Good for recent graduates, bad for seniors",3,"The company is good enough for any recent graduate, since there's a lot of room for growth (mostly in title rather than salary, but it's OK). Benefits are good, the technology used inside is usually 2 years beyond the most current (which is good enough to keep in the tech loop). There's a lot of flexibility regarding when a employee has a dr. appointment or need to pick their kids. However... (read cons)
","It's very hard to get a good raise (if at all), even if you change to job title that's supposed to grade you a lot more; they will always cap your raise, even if that means you will not earn the minimum of your new job title/grade. When you reach a certain hierarchy level (can be, leader, manager, architect, etc.), THEN you realize the company is a ""dog-eat-dog"" one.

If they want you out (for whichever non-justified reason), rather than laying you off, they will harass you from all angles (management/peers direct harassment, work overtime, vacations canceled, working on weekends, etc.). If you want to scalate this harassment to HR or higher directors, the direct-report-management will make sure to claim you are a bad frustrated worker and that you are finding an excuse to blame others for your own fault. They will even fabricate evidences if necessary. If you want to play fair and discuss this professionally, then they will eat you, as you're been the dog eaten on this dog-eat-dog company.

This company actively encourage mobbing despite what their brochure says.

All the ""Jabil-values"" are merchandising disposable words, made only for the sake of accomplishing a false sense of ""we care about employees and work environment"". It's made just to fool some employees, providers, recruiters, job candidates and, why not, external orgs that evaluate places to work.

As many other electronics-oriented companies, this one will make sure it will attempt to deliver false and pretentious promises to their customers regardless of the human cost. Many employees have developed serious medical conditions for working in this company (heart-diseases, high-pressure, high stress levels, depression, lots and lots of divorces, families destroyed, etc.).

","Each year Jabil goes after different lines of business. This is actually a good thing ... Where the issue comes in is that, depending on what you do, you could get moved around a lot. So it was hard, for me at least, to ever truly become an expert at one thing. Also, most years they have layoffs. I lived through a lot of them and can tell you that if you are performing well in your job, you will survive them. Where i think it might get a bit dicey is if you are moved to a different area, for example, and under a new manager. Then it could theoretically become a ""musical chairs"" event where a layoff might come and you get cut as the ""new"" guy. I wouldn't let any of this keep me from joining the company though.

Sun Jul 27 2014,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Not impressed!!,7,"Jabil is profitable. It's hard to argue with the company's success.
","I'm new to the company. I became a Jabil employee through an acquisition. All of us at the acquired company had high hopes regarding Jabil but these didn't pan out. Some of the challenges include a general lack of regard for employees overall. At least that's my opinion based on what I've seen. The executives of the company say all the right things about the importance of employees (and they seem sincere) but what they say doesn't align with what I've seen and experienced. An example would be the way the company gives complete deference to the Compliance Department. I understand the need for strict compliance in a SOX governed business environment. Unfortunately, though, Jabil has let their approach to compliance remove a good deal of trust from the culture which I suspect is not of much concern to senior management. 

Another indication of how sick the Jabil culture is would be the institutional arrogance at the corporate office. The shabby quality I've seen from the people working at St. Pete, and their complete lack of interest in improving should be embarrassing to the senior management. How some of them remain employed, I do not know. Yet the Jabil executives seem not to care so long as the profit number is delivered. Meanwhile, the corporate middle managers who are engaged in ""kingdom building"" go on hiding behind general department e-mail addresses that help them dodge accountability, laying blame for errors on underlings, and generally ignoring the employees they are employed to serve. 

A recent employee survey done to get a feel for how the Jabil culture could be improved was so far off the mark that many people refused to fill it out. The Jabil management team didn't even allow respondents to add comments to the survey that could have yielded valuable information. The survey was strictly a multiple choice exercise covering issues that did not get at the systemic problems influencing the company's culture. Perhaps it was simply a case of not asking questions to which management really didn't want answers.
Advice to Management
Start holding managers accountable for their unacceptable work and attitudes.

Ask employees in simple terms what they would like to see improved. Then listen to, and honestly respond to their answers. Then do it again, and again until you really understand.

Sat Apr 05 2014,Anonymous,"Saint Petersburg, FL",Former Employee ,Being on the Cutting Edge can make you Bleed !,1,"- Jabil moves very fast in response to customer demands.
- Jabil is present in more than 55+ locations, across the globe. 
- Jabil does offer its staff the chance to work on some very cutting edge CE products. 
- Jabil can erect a new product manufacturing line faster than almost anyone.
","- While Jabil has a fairly young staff overall. The politics and decisions are driven by those with 15+ years in house. So plan your moves wisely. 
- To respond fast to customer demands, often leads staff to 60 and 90++ hour work weeks on salary
- The far flung manufacturing plants mandate lots of travel, so give up your Sat and Sundays. You'll be in the airport queue then. 
- If you are overseas, and the factory is running on Sat and Sun, then so are you. Working For Free !! 
- Jabil can and will close a manufacturing line equally fast. Most line workers are let go the same week.
- If a customer kills a product line, then Jabil sheds their own staff incredibly fast. That includes salaried professionals all the way up through Supvrs, Mgrs, and Dirs. Lateral job placements are a rare and very competitive commodity. 

 So living under the guillotine may not match your lifestyle.

Mon Apr 22 2013, Industrial Engineer,"Memphis, TN",Current Employee ,Good Company Mindset. Poor Execution.,3,"The company mindset and culture is great; very entrepreneurial, self start, do-it yourself, and work hard, play hard. At the local site, the people that I have dealt with seem motivated, nice, and genuinely helpful. The challenges are exciting, and you can quickly gain experience. Jabil does try to make up in benefits [full health with low premiums, good 401.k, stock purchase plan, profit sharing] for what they lack in pay.

Although you wonder if you even have an upper management, there are some real gems within middle management. All problems said, Jabil is definitely the best compared its competitors, and it should be said that may of its problems are the nature of the business environment that it is in. It has also seemed to recognize/acknowledge these problems and has started to make steps to change if however slight.
","Jabil has grown into a large international manufacturing services company while keeping the strong small business mindset but has seemed to keep small business problems. Many times templates and previous solutions are no where to be found, and with I do-it yourself culture, when you point out that you need tools, you are often assigned the work to create it. Long-term planning is little to non-existent even in long-running accounts. Management does seem to only go for short ROIs, and concentrate more on checking actions off a checklist than verifying if those actions were done with any quality. When the complications come up because there was no proper planning, the management solution is to promise to fix the long-term problem, but until then, the solution is working people harder.

Direct compensation is lower than most would like, but with the extra benefits, it seems bearable. It would be more acceptable if the company gave more individual and team bonuses based on objective performance or if it worked harder to develop and promote.

From the first week, I was treated with zero respect and made to fear for my job every day since. The more I showed fear, the more it seemed to be enjoyed by the Director. Sad thing is that the majority of the team had more experience and leadership skills than the Director, however she seems to be untouchable. People has quit, been fired and retired early due to stress.

Being a very fast paced contract manufacturing leader, much is expected, you need to know what your doing and hit the ground running, above all remain accountable for your input and actions. The culture is one of fostering from within, and I found the longevity of their employees above all their greatest asset.

","Jabil doesn't put much value in work/life balance. This may have been a workable equation when the company stock options were increasing in value, and people felt their contributions were leading toward a bigger, long-term reward, but with so many options under water now, it's more like a basic sweatshop. Also, the way the company has held Florida taxpayers hostage in order to squeeze ten of millions in tax incentives to stay in Florida is deplorable (see St. Petersburg Times, June / July 2008). Since business is down and Senior Management aren't getting additional comp through stock options, this is the approach they took to bolster the bottom line and line their pockets.

","Unless you're being parachuted into the company and started off on a high note, career progression is almost non-existent. The unspoken rule - compensation is based on the number of years experience rather than achievements. If you're looking for a stable lifetime employment, start low and stay forever. 

HR is biased towards management's decision and do not always act in the best interest of their employees. Policies and team structures are constantly changing (every few months) and there is a lack of a proper communication channel on these changes. Management team is expat-heavy with few locals.
Advice to Management
Please plan ahead. Frequent short-term changes to team structure and policies is both time-consuming and cost-ineffective. Rather than spending money on severance package, the business may be better off if a better fit/ someone who is suitable for the long-term outlook of the company is hired instead.

Management are only interested in short term cost cutting. They just want the cheapest option and will make you redundant if you become too expensive.

They can set teams up to fail with unrealistic goals and deadlines just to replace teams with what they really want. Or they can remove key stakeholders so that the project folds in on itself.
Advice to Management
Don't treat remote employees like they're second class. Include them in the decision making process and communications that affect them.

Remember that your employees are people and not just numbers in a spreadsheet that can be replaced with cheaper numbers.

When redundancies or restructuring happens don't leave people in the dark about the future of their employment. One minute they'll tell you you're fine, then the next half your team is gone.

Have open and honest communication.

 Also, new ideas and changes are what the company is looking for from their employees. If you have an idea that, managers are open for implementation. In fact there are schemes to get employee projects recognised throughout the company. 
Big work-life balance emphasis- typical day is 8-4:30 and shorter are fridays. 
Changing projects. New clients come in with new products as well as the company constantly expanding into new sectors and markets. There's always something new available.
Opportunities for travel even as an intern

It is generally a male majority company though numerous projects to encourage diversity and support women. 
But sometimes it feels like an ""old boys club"" mainly in the higher levels of management. 
Employees have to support their own development. Many resources but not much guidance and mentorship to on utilising the resources.
Advice to Management
It would be great if there was much support and focus on employee develop. Though there is a lot of resources and employees are free to take advantage on development, it would be better to have employee guidance. For instance, monthly reviews to check that employees are meeting monthly goals. 
Need of younger employees. The company needs to better advertise itself and its opportunities. 
It's fast paced but can get unorganised. 
The company can be too accommodating for its customers. Customers can come in with numerous changes to the product or request numerous changes, which Jabil usually complies in. However, it slows down production and leads to production lines stopping as well as other costs.
