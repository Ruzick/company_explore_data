To put it into perspective a bit, in my opinion the only thing you might have trouble with is, if you are in the bay area, Seattle or somewhere with comparable cost of living and want to buy a house. If you are renting or live somewhere else I think you should be fine. I still think you could buy a house in these areas but it will take a decent amount of saving. I would guesstimate for myself 3 - 5 years for a down payment of between 10% and 20%, on a house in the $1 million range. Living decently comfortable.

","Let's see, where do I start:

1. It took them almost a week to get me a computer when I started. Promised me one setup when I was hired and then gave me a lower spec, inadequate machine and never leveled it up.
2. Lots of talking about work life balance during hiring and then switched to un-realistic deadlines with no support for success.
3. Very poorly organized and run dev teams. Basics such as how to organize and run a scrum board are non-existent.
4. It took them almost a month the get me enrolled in benefits that were supposed to start on day one of hire.
5. Within two months or hire they fired my bosses boss and another team member due to a restructuring.
6. Extremely political. Lots of people spinning their wheels because of basic project organization issues.
7. Lots of hiring to check boxes instead of for actual talent.
8. An excessive amount of red tape to do simple things.
9. Lots of employee rah rah sessions, but when the rubber meets the road with the important things...like getting the tools you need, benefits sorted out in a timely manner etc. stuff does not happen.
10. On one hand managers are trying to convince people the no further purging will happen, but then actions are coming down that make it clear that more trouble is on the horizon.

All of this was after they had tried to actively recruit me and woo me to join.

","Following data points are specific to my experience and doesn't necessarily mean all teams suffer from the same. This feedback is specifically for Data Infrastructure team.
(1) People who have worked in the company for many many years don't share any knowledge or information to new staff. Extremely political. They feel their jobs at risk if they share any knowledge / subject matter which makes the environment highly toxic. I had to go run around people for permissions/ approvals, information shared is highly cryptic and misleading.
(2) Managers here lack leadership skills. They don't have a vision and are never sure of their roadmaps. They prefer to be people managers for HR purposes. I had to go to skip level to get help but even they were of no help.
(3) Chennai mafia - Yes, the office in Southern India is full of highly toxic personalities, scheming, misleading, extremely manipulating. They have subject knowledge but they are absolutely difficult people to work with. It's a shame that most of the Engineering resources are situated there.
(4) Insane and inhuman scheduling of meetings in late nights for visionless, directionless endeavors. Following Agile for a meaningless projects, blame games make your life stressful. I had to attend at least 10 meetings a day from 8 am to 11 pm. What a culture!

","The Information Security group is very cut-throat and not a fun environment to work in. It is full of unnecessary fire drills and inconsistent, temperamental leadership. Roughly half of the 2nd line InfoSec group, from CISO on down, do not care about their employees in the least. Managers will smile and lie to your face then do the opposite. Very unprofessional managers will openly mock former employees and expect you to laugh along at their horrible jokes lest ye be next. Last year they shrunk cubes and banned personal items on desks. Personal items must be kept in a bank of lockers so that it is easier to walk people out as they are terminated. InfoSec has constant ""reorgs"" to get rid of employees(Often more than once a year). Management complains that they can't find good employees, but the reality is, they probably should be taking a long look at their own management styles instead.

Get over yourselves. Look at what is going on in the technology world and embrace creative change. Your way of doing things is antiquated at best. 
Decide if PayPal is a bank or a fintech. You can't have it both ways. If you're a bank, which is the way you're acting, stop pretending to be a fintech. If you're a fintech, stop bringing in legacy blockers from your banking partners / senior managers.

having you work to ship your job overseas or to cheaper sites. Constant layoffs since going public and problem with female promotions in IT. Lack of honest communication and low pay compared to other companies.

","Honestly the only downfall is the customers sometimes. When dealing with money, people get upset. The beginning segment (SSP, or “settings, security and payments”) is rough just because you’re having to explain what an echeck is and why it takes so long to process, or that a transaction will not go through due to the security system blocking it. People can get angry, but that’s to be expected I guess. Just can be emotionally taxing. Gotta do well on your metrics or you can get in trouble.

Those who don’t are coached on how to get them up and the coaching is very helpful and not like being scolded etc. so I guess maybe that’s not a con after all lol.

Wed Jul 10 2019, Software Engineer,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee ,Laid back with no standards,5,"- Good work/life balance
- Ability to work with new technologies (i.e. React and GraphQL)
- San Jose campus is beautiful, a very pleasant place to walk around and show up to on a daily basis
- Expectations are reasonable (although almost TOO reasonable to the point of being lax)
","- Depending on team, people aren’t always the friendliest
- Lots and lots of bureaucracy and layers of middle management that make it extremely tough to navigate
- Code and engineering standards are essentially non existent. No one cares about the quality of code you write as long as you ship the feature. Yearly reviews have nothing to do with your engineering ability, promotions are often given out to those who have stuck around long enough to make it their “turn”. 
- Internal tools often break and don’t work, staging and development environments are incredibly unstable, and a lot of productivity is lost just waiting for things to work properly.
Advice to Management
Expect more out of your engineers and enforce higher standards. Understand what it takes for an engineer to be effective (hint: developing in a stable environment is kind of the minimum and you haven’t even reached that). Rather than throwing more bodies at a problem when productivity is lower, work to understand the root of the problem. Throwing money at engineers to appease them into working in frustrating and demoralizing environments will only take you so far and won’t foster a culture of good engineering.

I worked at PayPal full-time for more than 3 years
Pros

Cons
I was brought in to PayPal as a security consultant in their San Jose office in March 2013. A month later my wife received the news of her pregnancy and I started making all the arrangements for it. Obviously I wanted the best for my wife so I got in touch Human Resources (I do not recollect any names) at PayPal to cover the medical expenses. They informed me about United Healthcare who was responsible for providing medical insurance to the employees. However, when I approached them with an exorbitant bill for non-invasive pre-natal test, they refused straight away by saying my wife was 
underage. The required age was 35. I was appalled by this reason as it made no sense at all. I am not sure who really fooled me, PayPal or United Healthcare.

","PayPal has blindly put their faith and trust in United Healthcare who is supposed to provide complete health protection to their employees. They are also supposed to cover all pregnancy related costs. However, when I approached them with a claim for my wife’s pregnancy, they flatly denied the bill for NIPT because my wife did not meet the minimum age criteria of 35. At first, I thought this was some joke but it wasn’t. They have this stupid rule for one reason alone that they do not wish to shell out such a huge sum of money for this test.

","Work life balance is terrible because of my manager signing the team up for way too much. Other teams are better so be careful with what team you accept a job from at PayPal. Despite being a startup cannot move up quickly despite what HR tells you when interviewing. Matrixed and political promotions like at a bigger Fortune 500 company so plan for that and do not accept a level less than your experience level as you will regret it. Do NOT allow HR / recruiters to underhire you because 2-3 years for promotion regardless of work. 1% yearly salary increase is the norm so be prepared to be paid in equity vesting over 3 year periods at 1/3 per year.
Advice to Management
Look at managers (senior director level especially) who run their teams ragged with extra hours due to their poor leadship skills. Many are used to running bigger teams at bigger companies and fail at transitioning to running small teams and do not listen to upper management telling them to focus on 2-3 things only. They spread people way too thin with weekend work and long hours daily because they do not listen to scope creep and non-sustainable hours being bubbled again and again. People are avoiding working for certain leaders because they are notorious for that even after only being at the company for 11 months. Train these managers or sack them. Talent will only put up with so much before finding a better manager at a competitor.

Wed Apr 03 2019, Business Analyst,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee ,Feels like an average company turning into a tech giant,0,"The culture at PayPal is, for the most part, really great. The people I work with care deeply about their work, especially in the diversity and inclusion sector. Groups of employees create their own initiatives and get support from the greater PayPal management. I have been impressed with the level of transparency leaders give to their different orgs, and the growing willingness to have difficult conversations.
","The company feels like it's in transition. Internal reorgs happen fairly often as divisions grow and the company figures out how it will be structured moving forward. Leadership is very open to feedback, and they make changes as we move forward. The campus is going under construction constantly, and building are either using an old dated aesthetic or have been remodeled to a fresh new look and feel. 

All of these things combined can lead to a feeling of ""incompleteness"" or ""unsteadiness."" That being said, this transition is only temporary, and I am more than willing to be contributing to a growing company who's eager to improve, and excited to be a tech staple.
Advice to Management
Management at large has been making good efforts to be as transparent as they can. However, I would still like that transparency to expand. There are times when things come out of the blue, and I'd like that trend to stop. This especially becomes difficult when talking about sensitive topics related to HR, but I would love for PayPal to take the lead on new trends of communicating with it's employees.

","Meeting culture is a productivity killer, “let’s have meetings just to have them”. And if you decline a meeting, expect to have a follow-up meeting scheduled to discuss why. 

If you don’t care to advance your career, this is a good place for you. Even if you have a supportive manager advocating for you, unless your department has a competent HR business partner and not just a roadblock, you can bet HR will either 1) shut the promotion recommendation down immediately 2) attempt to understand the employee’s job function and promotion justification with repeated inquiries for the same information, creating churn and additional work to deter managers from pursuing this process. Of course there are exceptions - if you’re a savvy politician, you have a chance of being promoted. It was demoralizing to work efficiently “do more with less”, see other people coasting and being rewarded for it.

Thu Jun 21 2018, Data Engineer,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee ,Not as innovating as I thought it would be.,1,"-Good people, hungry for more knowledge and innovation
-Good company mission
-Work life balance is pretty good, but it varies per team
-Good benefits
-Diverse, global team
-A large suite of classes and trainings for engineers to take to better themselves
","Ho boy, where do I begin?

-Pay is below market rate, and is being squirreled away in favor of stock options which vest over many years. Example: an employee will receive their annual bonus only 3 years after the fact.
-Heavy micromanaging via Agile - tasks are reprioritized almost daily, making the previous day's work a waste of time.
-Stack-based managing style - last customer that the manager or prioritizer talks to has the first priority task, no matter the actual importance of the task
-Rewards/recognitions are purely political; I have seen people get promoted for the sole reason that they need a higher level person in that location. 
-Bad engineering practices in non-customer-facing teams - I have seen horrors like shell scripts that write to file to pass variables to subroutines. This is enterprise-level production code.
Advice to Management
Management is trending towards the business perspective, where engineering is considered ""manufacturing"" and is therefore expendable/outsourceable. Furthermore, if a request comes in for a meaty tech project for our engineers to participate in, it is immediately outsourced. As a tech company this is unacceptable; we have trained software engineers writing either shell scripts or SQL queries all day. This makes our company values of ""Innovation"" and ""One Team"" ring hollow.

But hey, stock price is going up I guess.

I worked at PayPal full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
PayPal is the undisputed leader in online payments and things are constantly changing. As a company that's been established for nearly twenty years, it's still operates as a start-up at heart but suffers from growing pains in various fields. This leads to new opportunities for those who are willing to step out of their comfort zones. For those that want a stable job and don't care too much for new roles, they will fit in as well. There are many lifers working for PayPal in their operation centers. The company is employee focused and is constantly updating their benefits packages to stay at the leading edge for offerings. The company has some flexibility with scheduling which allows for a healthy work/life balance.
Cons
Promotional opportunities are based on your past performance ratings, so if you've had a supervisor who rated you unfairly you'll find it difficult to promote. The pay is competitive at the entry levels, but as you promote they lose some of the competitive edge.
Advice to Management
Continue focusing on your employees and don't forget that they are the backbone for the company.

Wed Jan 24 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Incompetent Management Bring Down Productivity,10,"I have worked for PayPal for sometime now because I really like the company, its mission and vision. I also like how our CEO, Dan Schulman, leads the company.
","I loved and was proud working at PayPal until recently, when there was a re-org. I have met some Senior Leaders of the company who are good leaders but others are not, unfortunately. The ones who are less competent or less productive are creating an unhealthy workplace.
I’d like to highlight some of the negative behaviors/negative culture of the Senior Leaders in my group:

 1. They have intimidated staff members at meetings so much so that they are hesitant to speak out or voice their opinions, thus creating an atmosphere of anxiety and trepidation.
 2. An employee was told by a Sr. Leader that using the restroom during work hours was not permitted.
 3. During Kids at Work Day, a company-wide event, a manager told employees that they had to stay at their desks even workload is permitted.
 4. Sr. Leaders have been known to procrastinate and take a long time to make decisions. There have been several instances where their indecisiveness led to urgent ""fire drills"". They waver about how things should be done and as a result, project deadlines are compromised. When mistakes are made, they don't want to be held responsible or accountable for them, so the ""finger-pointing"" starts. Others are blamed for the mistakes they should ""own"". Furthermore, this indecisiveness and procrastination has caused a late reporting which increase regulatory risk for the company. 
 5. We recently received an email communication regarding annual performance and 360 Performance Feedback as part of our review. However, our Sr. Leader mentioned that she will NOT incorporate it into our annual performance review, a blatant disregard for employees feedback/input. Sr. Leaders say that they welcome our input, but they are not honest with us. When we offer suggestions, it is not what they want to hear. It's ""their way"" or ""no way"".
Advice to Management
It is very disappointing and frustrating to work with incompetent, unreasonable and unprofessional senior management personnel. In the past, a Sr. Leader was reported to HR for the abuses/bullying tactics directed at the team, but NO action was taken to resolve the issue. Our efforts to be proactive have fallen on ""deaf ears"". Also, staff are now reluctant to report management misbehavior for fear of retaliation. This contradicts our company's mission of ""One Team Behaviors"". The morale on our team is very low, and a hostile and fearful work environment exists.
The above abusive behaviors by Sr. Leaders are tantamount to a usurpation of power. It needs to STOP! I am appealing to our CEO and/or HR to help prevent the situation from getting any worse, before it becomes a ""toxic"" working environment, putting a great company at risk.

Sun Feb 18 2018, CS Promoted,"Omaha, NE",Current Employee ,I wouldn't recommend.,13,"Sabbatical, and time off.
However, even though you earned PTO management still gets angry when you take time off.
","You get a base pay plus bonus if you meet metrics.
No one says it, but if you don't meet the metrics of ""getting results"" or a meets your job is in jeopardy. 
The metrics contradict each other: you have handle time and quality. You cannot service a customer fully and have a good handle time.
Also, if a customer hates the PayPal system but LOVED you and gave you a bad survey... you could lose your job.
Everyday things change.
You come into work and every Monday they change something.
Whenever I come into work on a Monday I assume that I am getting fired.
They hire so many people also that after hearing ""PayPal is the best place to work"" every day after a year you become the person that seems mean and nasty because it's annoying.

The cafeteria sucks!!
Same food everyday and the employees in the cafe are JERKS!
You come in at 8 and you can't take a break within the first hour of work.
So you're not eating until lunch.
Then at lunch time the cafe is ALWAYS ALWAYS busy and the people behind the registers just seem to be joking around rather than working.
They also tear things down early or are in a switch between breakfast to lunch or lunch to close.

Management is garbage.
I sit next to my supervisor and hear conversations of crap talking EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Rather than management talking to an employee directly it turns into back talking... where the employee will never hear about it.

MANAGEMENT HATES ITS EMPLOYEES.

Oh also, every single thing you do is monitored.
Your screens are recorded 24/7 and they tell you this.
So if you have a question you can't just email your neighbors or leave your desk. 
THEY CAN FIRE YOU AT ANYTIME FOR ANYTHING.
ITS HELL ON EARTH.

That's PayPal and the horrible individuals that work there. The entire place and the entire experience of working there is one big con. Management encourages snitching, even when none of it is true, and pulls the innocent, unsuspecting person who was snitched on (lied about) into a meeting room and ""confronts"" them. But they won't say who said it, or what they said, which leaves you defenseless. And they know it. And if you, as the unsuspecting innocent one, dare to defend yourself, management only doubles down on you. It's like the Gulag Archipelago in that place. Something is really wrong there.

Advice to corporate, get rid of or retrain the management and team leaders at the Hunt Valley location, this is why you have a high turnover rate. Of course there is going to be some level of staff turnover but you are losing good employees and retaining some not so good ones. In addition, there should also be urinalysis for drug use as part of the employment process because there are several employees that either come to work high and some that even do while at work. Two team leaders in particular, Stan and Kate, are very unprofessional and untrustworthy; both will blatantly lie on you for no apparent reason. Coming to the job with two graduate degrees and several years management experience, I clearly witnessed many things that were not properly handled along with gaps in implementation of best practices. I would not recommend this employer to anyone. This is definitely a job for people that do not have a lot of options in regards to employment.

","The company's pay is sub par for the industry, and I was only provided one cost of living increase of .25 cents in over four years. 

It was well known that many people would simply come work there for the experience, then leave for other companies who pay better for the same job. 

The company is incredibly disorganized internally. Personally I felt that people in charge of long term planing and communicating these plans were utter failures. With any given change, launch of a product, or even hiring e employees the plans implemented seemed to be 6 months behind. 

In general since the split of PayPal with eBay the company has made a huge turn from putting their customers and employees first to the all mighty dollar.

","Managers are the worst. Stingy as hell, won't give a yearly raise. Gives promotion with a bare minimum of 6% raise. Managers tend to favor women over men at promotion (this is the current norm at PayPal as a whole). Depending on the ethnicity of the boss, he/she will favor those who belong to the same ethnicity. Diversity is a joke. Risk teams are fully either Chinese or Israeli. Few people from other nations who were part of these teams were made (or forced) to leave the company. Too many re-orgs and jobs getting outsourced. High attrition. Paypal Risk has 1 manager for every 3-4 people, which translates to too much politics.

","I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone honestly. They do not keep their word on anything or practice what they preach. We were told we were in one department in training. And when we hit the floor we were basically all departments and were held accountable. PayPal is basically a Hardcore Call center expect to take 80 to 100 calls easily no filter for departments. They will let some people go for doing the same thing someone else is doing. But if they don’t like you you’re the one that’s let go or written up. I knew people that were well over the attendance threshold but were still working. While others were terminated on the spot because of their attendance. I had always wanted to work for this company in there Fraud Department or Compliance Department (Which are now nonexistent). They do have a lot of layoffs so you never know if you have a job or not. I believe at some point this company was great. But in the last year so many Great people left during the time I was there while the hardcore social climbers stayed. If you want to work for a company that pays very little and works you until your mental capacity is about to break this is the company for you. Employees will try to sabotage you because they think that's how they can get ahead. I was lied to over and over the entire time I was there nothing was consistent. But it’s done that way to brainwash you into working harder and believing that they really care when they don't. The workload is unbearable and they do not care until they are fined or losing money. They micromanage you without doing it aggressively by 7 meetings a week. There's one team meeting per week, 5 short meetings then a one on one with your manager every week to keep up with you. I would have rather had an hour lunch incorporated every day or an extra mental break. They’re very unprofessional but that's so that you will let your guard down to instill trust them. If you are an adult and want to feel like you are trusted and given benefit of the doubt and like to work independently do not work here. Not to mention an electronic key to log into your computer that's how much they trust you. They have laid off two departments that were really great departments (All Back office Positions). But claiming there is still opportunity in the company. The pay is definitely under what they expect from you. We were told we would be in one department doing one job function. On a day to day bases we were taking calls from other subsidiaries , also Site support calls , email calls , dispute calls , fraud calls and collections calls (without getting paid for collections). If you like really intense and very busy hyper environments this is for you. Management walking around all day constant meetings right there on the floor. Management also standing around talking to one another about other employees. I honesty felt really uncomfortable and I had reason to feel so. They let go of all the genuine management and kept the ones that were willing to be corrupted in fear of losing their jobs. And forget about sick time with this company you will be lucky to have PTO for 5 or 6 days. Not much work balance in my opinion unless you want to take it without a check.

 There is always someone on the floor watching. The walls are glass so there is always someone looking. Wages are roughly about $15 an hour but there expecting $ 18 worth of work. You are not fired for your stats but you are reminded of them every day aggressively. And the way they are set up you look really bad unless you are in a very low percentage. And wage increases are very minimal not huge in any way. I suggest seriously if you are not willing to give your soul and integrity to this company think twice. I have talked to people that had mental breakdowns and were let go. The final act was just jaw dropping all lies no truth what so ever which in any other state they couldn’t have gotten by with lying. If you go into this company trust no one always know that you are judged every second. Everyone is scared when people are fired you ask what happen to this person. I don't know there just not here anymore? No one should live in fear like that. The stats are basically a monthly report (but its weekly) they have everything on their except for your bathroom breaks but they are monitored separately and definitely a big deal. They send your stats out to everyone that's so you can feel bad if you’re behind and work harder. Nothing is private it’s all designed to make you work harder for nothing. Stat wise you have 6 other things to meet including a Re-contact rate and a Transfer rate. Yes! You are held accountable if the customer calls back as well as if you have to transfer them to another segment. Plus you couldn’t really assist the client in most cases because PP systems had already implemented the decision (Which I heard that's why the compliance dept. was not needed. So in all essence you were there to take the heat and couldn’t give an answer. But at the same time you were given the negative survey for this which heavily weighed if you made bonus or not? It really was stressful and didn't make a lot of sense. If you are looking for stability I wouldn't bank on this job. If you are an adult and looking for a real job skip this place they cater to mostly the younger population now. To mold them into how they expect PayPal Soldiers to be and to be grateful for working for the company. Bonuses are a joke they are quarterly and very little money. Management do not work at all just schedule one on ones all day and go to meetings what I said above. And it really makes the environment uncomfortable because you don’t know what’s going to happen next. Which in most cases there is always something but nothing that’s going to advance the employee’s paycheck. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. They do not pay enough for the quality of work and expectations that they want from their employees. And the micromanagement is stressful and overbearingly scripted. The company feels more like a cult than an actual place to work which made me uncomfortable especially for the money. You will have scripts to read and will sound like a android daily. This company’s reputation is surviving off the people who had integrity that are now leaving either by choice of force. As time goes on you will see that the reviews will rapidly decline. All that remains are the people with no heart no conscious and just trying to survive to keep their job.
Advice to Management
Pay your employees more so that they will want to invest in stocks in the company. Instead of wondering why people aren’t willing to do it.

Raise your wages if you want quality work and want people to stay a logo isn't enough. Hire enough coverage so that people won't have to take back to back calls. Get an IVR system and phone numbers so that people can contact the departments they need so that the call volume is stable. Don't hold people accountable on their stats for calls that are not part of their department. Make the stats normal so that people can understand why they loss there bonuses or how they could lose it. Don't sandbag your employees without letting them know and implementing the proper steps warnings and procedures. Treat people like an adult and not children.

","- Some horrible engineering management
- No future. No new products (which is why there is time to rewrite and update to cutting edge tech)

- Lot of politics
- Low hiring bar

Sat Oct 07 2017,Anonymous,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee ,Technology and Prof Services POV,0,"Great benefits, if you get on the right team it's a dream job. There is a lot of freedom to pursue projects, certifications, lots of training, and a great outlook for where the business is going. 

Someone somewhere that makes the big decisions realized there were big changes needed, and empowered Product and Technology to make them. It's still a work in progress, but it's certainly getting better as time goes on.
","You have to find the right team. I know some teams are not a great experience, sadly. 

As with any large company with a LOT of branches, there are communication issues where teams don't always share needed information. 

In some roles (such as management) work/life balance is challenging. Additionally, the rating system is on a grading curve which absolutely sucks.

Some decisions are held up because of process, and the bug metrics seem to result in ticket closing instead of actually getting to the root of the problem.

Products are focused on particular silos rather than overall experience. 

The longer you work here, the harder it is to get promoted. This is the most serious downside in my opinion, and is causing good and knowledgeable people to leave for other opportunities. It seems like in order to get to the level you should be, you have to go outside the company after a few years.
Advice to Management
We need to get out of our own way. Build for a great experience and quit focusing so much on what the competitors are doing. If we build it right (and simply!), we'll win.

Let your managers make decisions more quickly, and stop having single points of failure for decision making.

Fix the way we promote internally. For the love of everything, get rid of the arbitrary ""can't jump two grades"" rule! If you retain knowledgeable people by paying their worth, they will return the investment instead of leaving and you won't have to constantly be training new hires for strategically important roles.

Care more about PYPL's reputation in the technology/developer world.

The Benefits (medical dental vision) life insurance fraud protection (alot of others too many to name they even have very great benefits for both mothers and fathers who are employed with the company for planning a family you get your regular 8 weeks for maternity leave then baby bonding time within the first year you get extra 8 weeks of time off with your new baby so total of 16 weeks which is awasome they also have great adoption assistance and tuition reimbursement

Sunday and tuesdays they have FREE donuts and Fruit

 

The lavista NE location is very well kept nice gym, cafeteria, volley ball court and basketball court with a pond in the back to walk around during breaks/lunches

The desk are bigger than normal call centers i've seen!
","Just as any other call center you are sitting 95% of the time and it can get tiering sometimes you get conflicting information on what is right and what is wrong. They seem to say there is room for career growth however with out a degree i have not seen that possible and ive been there two years. 

The calls can be very dificult (depending what department you are in) however Debit card Department you get the callers who are upset about their cards not working or issues with their account and they can be highly unproffessional rude. 

Metic based per performance- some of the metrics just as any other call center AHT there are some metrics we as employees are subject to but its not within our control ex AHT is in your control call control but when we get bad survey they make it impossible for it to be appealed even if it was the correct response we gave the customer if their upset we have to take the hit on the survey which affects our TIP payout (bonus) at the end of the quarter

When i started i knew it was a call center however i did not know what position i was going to be placed you dont get to choose what you want you go through :my path"" then they decide and give you a schedule you cant change it unless there is a ""shift bid"" available and it does not happen often. we can not shift trade like other call centers allow you too. its very limited

Lower level management is highly competent
","Upper management recently experienced some drastic changes, which resulted in many cloak-and-dagger actions including forced demotions in lieu of paying unemployment. Recently there have been some severe layoffs due to (ineffective) automation practices in addition to outsourcing to highly incompetent workers. This was a great company to work for several years ago but, although it is too self-sustaining to fail, is certainly not going anywhere fast. For a company that boasts significant growth every quarter, it's a travesty that benefits such as shift differential and bonuses were cut so dramatically for seemingly no reason.

","So much of employee engagement, happiness, and consistency depended on what team you were on.

There was very little consistency and as I moved up in my career, that didn't change.

- If you can keep up with the high work demands, there is good upward mobility up to a certain point.
","- If you work on one of the critical back-end teams, you can kiss your weekends goodbye. It's very common to see people in the office until 7, sometimes as late as 10 for a deployment hand-off to an India team.
- Mediocre culture (perks != culture). Although overall there is diversity, individual teams hire people like themselves (diversity != inclusiveness)
- Non-flexible work for engineers. They always assign more work than is feasible to complete. They expect people to work at a constant output all of the time.
- Managers may ask you to do extra on top of your work, which can be rewarding for your career, but is mostly to help the managers look better in their fight to look good.

Executive leadership needs to open the hood and check out the engine - in all areas of the company, not just San Jose; leverage the employee satisfaction surveys to hold your leadership teams accountable - it's one thing to say you want the feedback, but another to address the root cause problem and not just a symptom. It is unfortunate that PayPal just can't seem to get out of their own way most of the time.

Cronyism is alive and well, if your in the clique or inner circle you are destined for a raise, bonus and not affected by the new blood mantra, otherwise expect to be rifted out.
