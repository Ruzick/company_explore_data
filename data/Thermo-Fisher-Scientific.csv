","It may be, in a lot of ways, a safe place to work. But, they still have a long way to go to completely protect their employees from unknowingly getting sick from exposure to the clinical trial drugs that people expose themselves to. Favoritism is a thing here from supervisors down as far as I could tell, if they don’t like you, primary workers will run you out, or shut you out. They like to periodically edit your job title duties by adding responsibility, with or without your consent. And not to mention will not compensate you for those added responsibilities. Supervision can be very gun-ho yet that goes for a-lot of people here. And I speak especially of those who work in Primary. Cut pay instead of raise it when COVIID hit this only effected Supervision and up.

","Long 17 hours to 20 hours work day, 7 days a week. $30k below market value pay. Leadership and management constantly yell and scream at employees. Divisional presidents and VPs are aggressive and nothing to show for. 

Made over $5 billion revenue Covid money but make entire company take major pay cut and forced employees to forgoe PTO hours and work over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Lower band level employees were forced to do sr.director and VP level work. Disabled employees are being threatened that they will lose their job if they take medical leave. Honestly people just didn't have the money or everyone would have sue the company. No job growth, no development opportunity, reorganization every 3 weeks, rewards poor performers while high performers takes entire department work. 

Many employees are worked to the point of having major health issue. How is a company whose branding builds on making a world better and safer place and world leader in covid testing does not even provide own employees covid test when none essential employees are being forced to work on site? Not only did they forced employee to work onsite. When employees tested positive for covid, they blame it is employees fault for needing to work in close proximity. Those employees who are none essential are being told they are lazy because people managers are voicing concerns about their employee safety.

I have been working at Thermo Fisher Scientific full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Conscientious leadership, excellent corporate resources for employees, highly collaborative environment, internal job-seeking encouraged, Health benefits extraordinary for some chronic diseases. Lives its mission to make the world cleaner, healthier, and safer. CEO leads the company in a unique way, where everyone bands together in times of economic turmoil to avoid job loss and if you hang in you are rewarded in the long-run.
Cons
Generally, benefits are middle of the road in every aspect. The constant movement of/within departments means there is always at least 1 man down on a team, often more. Promotions are rare, interviewing for another role is the best way to get ahead, but it can be very competitive. Information flows top-down so having a good manager who is transparent is critical to your success.
Advice to Management
Make 360 reviews mandatory for all managers every year, or every other year, so that ineffective and toxic leadership can be identified.

Management has stepped up its game in ways that are not placation. There has been a truly pivotal and dynamic shift in the inclusiveness and welcoming nature of discussion and understanding within company social media. 

It has led me to being proud to work for this company after multiple years of thinking that they were ""just another big company that doesn't care"". 

IT department has a core structure of dedicated, qualified individuals working together to support common goals.

Annual employee feedback survey is actually taken to heart by management and I have seen improvement based on feedback year over year.

Job Stability During COVID. My team is global, so I already worked remotely.
","Promotions difficult depending on department. Lots of opportunities to move internally does generally move problem co-workers out of their current position. If you like your department, your boss will have to fight to get you promoted.

Like any job, your boss will determine if you like your position or not. This is the first year that I've had the same boss from goal setting to goal review (1 year), making it insanely hard to get promoted.

Unclear why some executives are on a fast track when they don't understand their divisions well.

","There is more of an emphasis on maintaining the status quo than on innovation (which is supposedly one of their core ""values"" but it is never practiced). The Practical Process Improvement (PPI) initiative is based on decades-old Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts and I did everything I could to upgrade the company to Lean. However, I was fought at every turn for telling the truth about PPI's limitations and trying to make real improvements.
Advice to Management
Immediately scrap PPI and implement Lean using outside experts (no one I met there besides me had any real understanding of Lean or even basic tenets of process improvement). Redo your metrics to support the Lean effort (the experts will tell you what they are). 
Fix your Ethics program to actually work - which means don't use your own HR department to investigate/determine ethics violations because they will never find any as their job focus is to protect senior management from workers/whistleblowers who report ethical lapses by them. These are the two main reasons why I left and I know many others who left because of the toxic work environment. 
Also, you need to be more concerned about putting people in leadership positions that actually have the talent and ability to do the job than just trying to improve diversity to win awards. Applaud the push to improve diversity but the people need to also know how to do the jobs for which they are hired. Last two directors were complete disasters with no leadership skills or relevant knowledge/background in the field of process improvement.

","Very understaffed. Long hours and if your salary, you may be taking a pay cut. Many people work weekends too. I’d rather have a smaller bonus instead of always working to catch up and always feeling like I’ll never be able to work enough hours in a day to get close to getting it all done. I don’t like dreading and not enjoying PTO days because I’ll be so behind when I go back. No redundancy in task executors. The benefits could be better for a large company. Cigna health that is quite expensive. PTO is standard 21 days to start and isn’t really negotiable, even if you have 20 years experience.

Advice to Management
Practice what you preach; say as you do, then do as you say. Management would say that they'd never put you in certain situations, but then turn right around and assign you to those tasks they said they'd never put you in - and then reprimand you for trying your best (but invariably coming up short). They would instruct you to always keep them informed; however when matters would arise that require immediate attention/decision (as they always do in field service), management would get around to replying to you 3-4 days later when you originally needed a decision in 3-4 minutes. Thermo epitomizes the adage that they set you up to fail time and time again. I left Thermo before having secured another job because I was so miserable - as is this company.

","Management tends to treat employees as nothing more than skill sets, instead of valuing each person for their domain knowledge. There is no company loyalty to the employee, despite employee loyalty and longevity. Internal reorganizations left people in positions where they were not optimally placed, nor happy with the new (forced) position duties. They will not hesitate to then ding them for slower performance and kick them out the door, regardless of how successful they were in previous positions or projects. It felt like the old ""underhanded layoff"" technique that is common in corporate America.
Advice to Management
Return to a mindset where people are seen as humans first, skill sets second. Reward their loyalty with loyalty to them. Ensure each middle-manager holds these values first and foremost, instead of letting them ruin people's retirements and career growth with their ill-informed decisions to terminate otherwise valuable employees simply because their current project isn't a good fit for them, especially if it was forced upon them. It's understandable that contractors may be let go when projects are completed, but this approach should never apply to permanent folk, and yet I witnessed it first-hand on numerous occasions.

Sat May 23 2020," Staff Scientist, Product Manager","Carlsbad, CA",Former Employee ,"Growing Company, Poorly Integrated, Dysfunctional, Slow at Execution",5,"- Fantastic 401K match and the vesting period is short compared with competitors
- Great resources (ability to get lab supplies at or near cost)
- Company hosts many exciting events and workshops throughout the year and are great opportunities to gain skills or volunteer
- Company is very lean, and is heavily focused on data metrics and KPIs, I really appreciated the focus on continuous improvement
- The education scholarship is generous, albeit more restrictive compared with other employers
- Healthcare offerings are variable depending on the group and region, some pre-merger legacy plans that Thermo has retained are truly unmatched
- Company has a relatively young, vibrant workforce and is growing
- On-site amenities, including gym and cafeteria (where available) are cheap and accessible
- WFH flexibility is great if you get the right manager and department
","- PTO policy, though on the surface fairly generous at 3 weeks starting, is inflexible and difficult to navigate in my experience compared with competitors (example: maternity leave)
- The company is an agglomeration of a number of smaller companies that were the product of Thermo's buying binge over the past couple of years. There remains quite a bit of overlap and silos that result in unnecessary duplication of functions and resources, territory disputes, office politics, and communication challenges. Except for a very few functions, expect to be frustrated by this on a regular basis.
- Advancement opportunities are lacking and raises are paltry compared with competitors. The company does emphasize ""lateral moves"" into other roles, which I appreciatively took advantage of during my career at Thermo Fisher. However, in my own experience many times this resulted in others coming in who were completely unfamiliar with a product line that took on a management or oversight role where they have no clear idea what the product really is, how it is used, or how it is manufactured. It is also exhausting to have to re-introduce yourself to your new manager and to justify your existence and importance to the team if you're doing it 3-4 times a year.
- The websites are truly an absolute dumpster fire and the company has no easy solutions to address it. It is difficult to get a customer interested in a product when they themselves cannot find it on the website.
- Constant instability, turnover, layoffs that weren’t fully thought through, and unrealistic expectations. As a result, there was frequently a lot of friction and resulting drama between on-site employees or underhanded tactics from mid-level managers that subsequently amplified the drama and hampered productivity (i.e. artificially inflating numbers, stealing resources and materials from other groups in the middle of the night to ""hold down the budget"").
- The open-plan office space and dearth of conference and huddle rooms at many larger sites make it logistically difficult to schedule and hold meetings
- Many of the Senior Directors and VP's seem to have an almost ""Cult of Personality"" problem. While Thermo Fisher has a top-notch Internal Communications and PR Shop, the focus on AV, bright lights, and showmanship versus more open, honest dialogue and communication results in it being an uninformative pablum. Why does there need to be a DJ and produced light show at a site's quarterly Town Hall discussing company performance? Isn't that a bit excessive? Why does the Leadership and Marketing Teams need to frequently come in and disrupt the lab operation to ""play act"" science for the camera? If you have a question or concern regarding a decision being rolled out from the top, do not expect a speedy or satisfying answer, or even a forum to gain further clarity
- I did experience the ultimate insult of finding out I was about to be laid off but before that was going to happen, I was asked to train my replacement on another continent.
Advice to Management
It is imperative that Thermo Fisher starts adhering to and complying with labor laws regarding safety and rest breaks for hourly workers, something they are (still) continuing to struggle with at some of the California and Oregon sites. The lack of competence, training, and compliance for some managers and supervisors overseeing hourly employees is, at best, inconsistent across groups, and at worst, negligent. This behavior is unacceptable, it is not building trust with the hourly workforce, and is bound to lead to additional legal action (yes, they have a history). Better HR and EHS infrastructure is needed.

Please do a better job of removing barriers to execution that are slowing down innovation and quality! TFS customers are doing incredibly important work and need those products, if there are issues affecting the quality, efficacy, or integrity of products, these must be addressed by management in a rapid, comprehensive, and meaningful way. Slow-walking or being opaque about an issue because a process must be followed or a sales goal needs to be hit are not acceptable and damages the company's reputation.

This is a great company that has had some great growth from an investment standpoint in recent years and is expected to continue growth in the long term plan. Not many days that you are expected to work over 8 hours, but occasionally this does happen.
","The organization is very stingy with raises from what I have experienced. Been at the organization some time now and haven't gotten a raise since I started. Definitely something to consider when negotiating salary in the hiring process. The company also has very convoluted data that is very difficult to work with, not much standardization in regards to how to handle the data to ensure accuracy of reporting. A lot of communication is done through conference calls and there are a lot of fire drills that need to be handled on a day to day basis (this is common anywhere when working with sales people). Management needs to understand the jobs that the employees are faced with better and work on developing employees on a higher level training. Onboarding seems to be low level and doesn't really help since most issues are relatively complex. Sales Directors pretty much run the show at this company and at times ask for some really complex reports that could be simplified or standardized if the company would upgrade some of their internal business systems. Seems like there are a lot of job postings but not much internal movement. Company likes to bring in a lot of people from outside and keep people in their current roles.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the performance review process or make some changes to align with the organization to maintain costs. Stop digging for ways to not give current employees annual raises when the jobs being asked of these employees are not structured very well from an employee onboarding/training process. There is a lot of turnover at the organization due to the lack of culture and difficulty to manage data. Reward your employees for hard work and you might see people stay around longer. Also, invest some money in better systems to get away from so much ad-hoc analysis. Obviously in a senior position there will always be ad-hoc but from my experience 75% of the job is done from scratch and if methodology does not align with what the sales team is looking for it creates a ton of re-work.

Tue Jan 28 2020, Quality Manager,"Allentown, PA",Current Employee ,Good company culture for safety and quality,1,"Company does well with communication. There are good corporate culture to drive safety and quality. Process improvements are much encouraged through PPI culture.
","Career development doesn't exist. I am with the company for more than seven years. In those seven years, I have seen mid level management positions vacated 9 times, and 8 of them were filled with external candidates. This is only in one department. That is 11% chance for a mid level manager to be filled by an internal candidate in seven years. This is very good for outside candidates, terrible for company employees. Company is busy educating outside hires and ended up losing be them eventually as well.
Advice to Management
Develop your high potential employees. Employees should be given high priority for career advancement instead of hiring from outside. The loss of knowledge and technical know-how is real and not sustainable. Frequent hiring from outside candidates are demoralizing. That means someone like me will have to rebuild my reputation over and over again to prove myself to the new management. Now I am at the point that I am starting to ask myself why. Why should I even try to be a high performer, given that my career path is leading toward a dead end.

There’s not even the cool factor, fun environment or perks to alleviate some of the stress associated with long hours and often unrealistic deadlines.

- Great people to work with. Most, if not all people in immediate surroundings work hard and carry their weight. 
- If you take initiative, you'll get plenty of opportunity to grow. 
- Drama is fairly minimal at the pre-managerial level.

- Technical teams are pretty lean
- Free coffee. You're gonna need it.

","-absolutely zero room for career advancement unless you are one of the manager's ""favorites"" - managers will block applications to other departments or find ways to tell you you're unqualified
-daily expectations exceed department capabilities (i.e. running skeleton crew and being expected to produce as much product as 2-3x the current labor force could provide)
-managers do not care at all about employee's well-being, we are merely the means to an end (i.e. ""I don't care, just get it done"" type of attitude)
-excessive OT leading to burnout, management sees no problem in losing staff due to this but refuses to train or hire new people
-profits over people is the Thermo Fisher way. get used to having suggestions ignored or downright dismissed right to your face.
-morale is near zero due to the promise of *temporary* 10 hour minimum days and occasional weekend work that turned into 6 months straight of 50+ hour weeks and a half dozen mandatory Saturdays (and counting!)
-HUGE disconnect between office workers and lab workers, the people who sit at their desk all day have absolutely no clue what we go through back in the labs (although in their fairness, we have no idea how hard it is to send emails and go to meetings all day either).
-the HVAC system is a total joke. the office area is nice and climate controlled but the labs used to be a warehouse - there is no insulation or thermostats. facilities literally has to climb inside the ceilings to open or close the vents in order to let in more or less heat or AC. some rooms are 79 degrees F, some rooms are 58 degrees F. again, management says it's not a problem and we're just going to have to deal with it.
-for a $21 BILLION corporation, you'd think they could afford to properly compensate their employees but salaries are a JOKE compared to similar jobs in the surrounding area (like 25-50% less!) 
-HR is not helpful, mostly because there's only 1 person and she's got hundreds of employees to deal with so basically unless it's extremely urgent she's never going to reply.

","It's a huge company so you may not feel a sense of community. Profit is the bottom line.

","Typical corporate-style management only cares about quotas and their bonuses. 
Expect you to talk to customers during business hours and expect you to work all evening on all follow-up office work. We are expected to be efficient with an extremely archaic and non-functioning CRM system that frequently crashes. Internal pricing teams and customer care are spread thin and overwhelmed with the demand of customers and orders. Management expects us, Account Managers, to be experts on thousands of products yet offer no training. There is a Technical Sales Specialist to work with but again are spread so thin we rarely get to work together effectively.

Not a good place for diversity and do not understand other cultures and personalities that are not typical white American.

Work Life balance is fake, certain people only
No fairness, only favoritism. You can do no wrong if management likes you. If you are not in that inner circle, just be ready to take all the blames even it's not your fault.
Racism heavily exists. Only one race will be promoted. They might put minority to unimportant spot occasionally just to show diversity, but never something meaningful position. If you are minority, female, colorful race or has foreign accent, you need to be quiet and obey, then you might have a chance.
Full of toxic culture. Few people will purposely speaking on phone so loud in open office space, so they can get attention from top. Also you will see few female employees constantly go to male director/VP's office to discuss ""works"" with door closed.
Backstabbing is real. This place doesn't care about your performance. Only what people say about you in the back matters. Be careful if you are smart and hard working, your manager and colleagues will not like it and they will try to take you down if you show too much ego. 
Finance system is just a disaster. You will be put into the place to create financial report with wrong data all the time. Watch out these people can talk intelligently about the system and data, they are the person with no clue but only really good in BS. But for some reasons, this company loves bs.
No job security. Be expected to look for new job every 1-2 years. They don't want you to stay at the same role too long. You need to go through the same interview process every 1-2 years competing with another 5 external candidates. That's their method to push out people they don't like without paying severance. 

If you are about to accept their offer but have another opportunity in hand, think twice. Make sure you know what environment you will get yourself into.

","The pay is exceedingly low for Silicon Valley. If you're not an exec or, possibly, in sales, I hope you have a spouse with a high-paying job or have other income otherwise you'll struggle to afford the average rent here. 

There are few opportunities for advancement within the company. Though training is sometimes available for other areas as a means for advancement, the company rarely follows through on the advancement part. There are large groups of employees stuck in low-paying, go-nowhere jobs.

Management turnover is high. There are frequent power struggles among departments and communication is often poor.

","• If you enjoy being part of a group of catty gossipy admin women, then this is the company for you. People say you get that anywhere you work, but nope I’ve never witnessed it quite like here!
• the upper management, or “4th floor” employees, are extremely rude, act well above others, and closed to new ideas.
• their only goal is to acquire as many smaller companies, to make as much money as they can - which I’m sure is the end goal for many businesses, but the over matrixed environment (the many companies rolled into one) makes working there unjustifiably insane.
• there is NO work/life balance

","I was fired and I don't know why. I had a great boss and my department was really great. I received a call one Friday night saying that my assignment was suddenly ended because of some complaints from a rival department. I was completely blindsided and didn't receive any feedback other than that I was out of a job. All I know is that I did my job as best as I could and some angry young people who don't know me and never talked to me didn't like me and formed a coup to get me fired. It makes me sad that people lead with their anger and form judgments of others rather than taking the time to get to know people their own age.

","This company is toxic on so many levels. There's bias on management and endless toxicity aimed at females, minority and older workers. They try to promote diversity inclusion however, this isn't the case. The distribution of work is uneven, there are certain teams where the workload is unevenly distributed primarily amongst teams with minority, females and older workers. Be prepared to work 12-15 hour days almost everyday and on weekends. The salaries are great but the number of hours worked in addition to the added pressure to perform is not worth the money at all. There's a lot of insecurities within management and often those insecurities are taken out on the employees. Onboarding is basically non existing management wants employees to perform without proper training and understanding of the complexity of this company. Every year the company cuts the bottom 10% of its employees. If your salary is on the average range be prepared to receive low/no annual raise and low bonus payments. People are stressed angry and management usually take the anger out on the employees almost everyday. This company is also not flexible with allowing work from home even though the option is there but its frowned upon when you do. Finally most employees have 3 weeks paid vacation however, its impossible to request time off, be prepared to work on vacation or put in endless nights before and after vacation. Vacation time is also on use it or lose it basis, so the time can't be carried over. Finally your HR partner is not here for you, they don't care about you any confidential conversation will be sent back to your manager so be careful and trust no one. I've never experienced stress the way that I do working for Thermo, te people I worked with would throw me under the bus all the time. Stay away if you're looking for a normal life, good work life balance and balanced mental health. They also hire alot of external candidates and does not promote within unless you are chosen by management.
Advice to Management
Learn to pay attention to your employees, their stress level and train your staff so they can properly understand the complexity of the business. Focus on evenly distribute work flow and stop promoting diversity inclusion, talent until you've fixed the issue of toxicity and unfair treatment to females and minorities. To retain talent you MUST properly onboard and train your employees, Stop trying to have them figure it out. Promote your employees and stop making them feel like the work they're doing does not add value to your bottom line because it does (its reflective on the quarterly returns). The company has potential to be a great place to work but the stress and gender bias will ALWAYS drive your good employees to leave.

-Constant stress and headaches over unrealistic goals. Moving goal posts.

Additionally, if you end up in production, some of the chemistry can be quite difficult. Following the batch record may result in failure. However when it comes time for bonus/promotions, you will be reminded that all you do is ""follow batch records"" and you don't ""go above and beyond to make drastic changes to the process"". Which of course you WOULD (updating batch records, etc.) if you had TIME. Which you don't.

Your personal goals are meaningless here, and management will straight up lie to your face about nebulous advancement opportunities just to get you to stay forever. Alternatively, they might straight up tell you that you do not do enough to move up. I'm guessing anyone less then a total savant is considered utterly useless.

Trying to train on processes is like pulling teeth. They are afraid to develop people, because they are worried they will lose them. The ideal employee here is barely smart enough to do the science, is willing to be treated like a blue collar worker, can work 2x faster than a normal human and is willing to lie to support the unrealistic goals.

NO JOKE. They actually discussed taping out a yellow square in front of the chemistry benches. You would have to be in this box a minimum of 8 hours a day, and any time spent away from your box (including bathroom breaks) would be unpaid. 

The philosophy here is ""do more with less"". That philosophy runs DEEP here. That is how they keep the margins on the products at 90% or higher. Personnel is part of the bottom line, so they are only interested in how to keep you down and keep you in the same role forever.

ASK AROUND! Some people have been here for 20-30 YEARS IN THE SAME ROLE. They are not stupid, they are not lazy, they just cannot leave due to having families etc. Thermo KNOWS THIS, and they take advantage of being the only large chemistry employer in the area.

I personally know of at LEAST 7 people who have had full on breakdowns due to the stress level here. There is NO WAY that is normal. 

I could go on, but I think I have made my point clear enough.

Fri Oct 26 2018, Staff Software Engineer,"San Jose, CA",Former Employee ,A decent company to work for,6,"- Company has very good vision and values.
-Very noble mission of making the world healthier, cleaner and safer
-CEO is very capable and has achieved very good growth for the company
-Opportunity to work with amazing scientists who constantly push the boundaries of what’s possible 
-Very stable work culture - some employees have been there over 30 years
-Good 401k match and great benefits
-15-20 days paid PTO in addition to 10 annual holidays. Unused PTO can be cashed out when leaving
","-Politics between teams and managers
-It’s hard to impossible to move within the company to different roles
-No free lunch and mediocre cafeteria food
-Very bureaucratic for IT requests, software development, HR processes
-IT policies are very backward - limited guest wifi access, only managers have access to start a web meeting, crappy antivirus that hogs your PC, clunky conferencing hardware. In this modern age, employees should be able to effectively participate in a meeting wherever they are and from any device of their choice.
- San Jose office building and facilities are from the 70s 
-Employees and managers seem to get promoted based on non work related activities such as community and charitable activities. These employees are given the center stage at company gatherings. Employees who actually get work done are taken for granted and get the backseat.
-Company is very stingy with resources even when they are profitable. It's a hassle to get approval for better computer hardware and technical training. Employees going on business trips are asked to drive instead of flying and share the same hotel room to save company money !
Advice to Management
To make the best products, you need to attract and retain top talent. Provide more avenues for employees to ask questions, provide feedback and move between roles without fear of retribution or bad politics. Don't be afraid to clean house once in a while and weed out the bad actors that suck the innovation and intensity of employees.

Invest in modern IT technology that enables employees to collaborate wherever they are and using any device of their choice. Improve the projectors and conferencing hardware instead of penny pinching on everything.

Toxic team environments. 
People don't matter, only revenue. They will work you until you drop even if they can afford to hire another body to help out.
Some very toxic leaders who contaminate those who report to them. 
Your performance is based on a comparison to everyone else's performance in your team/group even if you do completely different jobs and it is highly subjective.
Performance reviews are very old school and out-of-date, they don't help you to succeed.
Promotions are based on if your boss likes you, or if you are part of the ""in"" crowd, not based on your actual performance.
They don't help you succeed, and it sometimes feels like they purposely stand in your way of succeeding.

Stop with the ""good ole boys"" club and start to value what individuals bring to the table.

Thu Aug 02 2018, Operations Supervisor,"Fremont, CA",Former Employee ,Thermo Fisher Scientific- Fremont (Kato Road Location),2,"TFS Fremont is huge and booming with the acquirement of many different smaller companies and products within the pipeline. It seems like the forecast is stable and the future is bright. Also, the manufacturing operations team (operator level) is one of the most hardest working group of people i've ever met. There is new management within operations that is leading the team to success.
","With the wide variety of different products within the pipeline, I feel that the quality aspect of work is being neglected. The daily goal is to get product out the door, to satisfy customers and make dollars; but what about the broken processes that needs to be fixed? How can a multi-billion dollar company make so much revenue while the frontline operators suffer performing non-value added tasks such as the rework of lots and overtime on a daily? I don't blame the managers or the directors. I feel that it's a change that needs to happen beyond the SLT. Someone needs to step up and put safety and quality first before on-time delivery of product.
Advice to Management
Invest in the proper systems to get the job done such as a new ERP system, fix broken processes within the shop floor, focus on quality and safety before the delivery of product.

Mon Jul 23 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Growing Company, Very Difficult Culture",8,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is a growing company. The pay is good. The benefits are good. Some of the people who you work with are great.
","The culture and leadership style are like the military. The boss tells you what to do, and you do it, no questions asked. Any comment that is contrary to what anyone else says is taken as a negative comment, even when you are not trying to be negative, but constructive. There is a true fear of having an open and honest conversation, as the discussion will be held against you. You will be labeled as ""not a team player"" and that is how people may talk about you. Once this happens, your time at Thermo is limited. They have a very high turnover rate. This is due to the fact that 1. they let a lot of people go, and 2. a lot of people want to leave due to the difficult culture. 

This leads to an unbalanced work / personal life. I typically work 12 hour days and some time on weekends. As they ""reorganize,"" which is another name for downsizing, doing the same work with fewer people, the workload gets more difficult. Now their employment is growing, but you need to realize they are acquiring more and more companies. I had a woman work for me for 3 years, and she was happy and worked hard without me asking her to. She moved to a new boss who is more inline with the culture here, and she has been on the phone crying to me in the last 3 months several times. The sad part is no one can say anything to management or HR because then their job is in jeopardy. They are not a ""team player."" 

Last, one way they manage their cost is they let go of older talent, who also tend to be more expensive. They don't value the experience of the older employees, and thus, they just cut them to save the money. Then, they put someone with much less experience, or no experience in their place, and tell them to just do the job with minimal training.
Advice to Management
It is easy to look at the cost side of everything, but when you look at the value side, you have so much more potential for upside than just cost cutting. I understand that we are running a business, but people make up the business, and people will go the extra mile without the need for fear and intimidation. You set the culture, and the culture needs to change. There is a very hostile work environment for many people, and you can't hear it because they are afraid to speak up. They don't want to lose their jobs because they have bills to pay, kids to put through college, and many people don't like looking for a new job. 

I know it is hard to change, and there is a risk. The company is doing well and growing. So, messing with the culture could put that at risk. But, the human cost is too high. People need to be happy where they work, and not feel intimidated and fearful of their management.

","Constant pressure from VP to reduce costs which meant cutting staff every year. They ask 5% reduction each year which eventually means you have to let key people go. The division I was in also manipulated the process improvement process. Making sure end results reflected a specific outcome. Finally, You become a number only at this company I would encourage all to look elsewhere for a position. Perkin Elmer, Agilent, Waters.
Advice to Management
I do not believe upper management will change. This all comes down to the VP levels saving their jobs and at expense of all.

Thu Jul 12 2018,Anonymous,"Pleasanton, CA",Current Employee ,A zero culture company,13,"Friendly, genuine and hardworking teammates.
","So much politics with local management; extremely high turnover rate, removal of employee’s many incentives, no transparency from upper managment; too many acquisitions but failure to incorporate different cultures; horrible treatment towards temporary workers/contractors. Management is constantly playing the blame games to cover up incompetency. Middle management’s sole focus is to please the higher ups. There is no people culture here, people are just leaving so fast, it’s impossible to build a culture. Pay is bad comparing to its competitors. Zero work life balance.
Advice to Management
Respect and appreciate your workers. High turnover rate means something is going wrong, acknowledge the issue, stop covering up your problems by pointing fingers.

Tue Jul 17 2018, Senior Hardware Engineer,"Pittsburgh, PA",Current Employee ,Pittsburgh IT,4,"It used to be a great place to work. Good teamwork!
","Senior managers that are completely unprofessional and disrespectful, yelling at employees on conference calls for doing their jobs. 

No career advancement. No real directions from senior IT leadership. A lot of dog/pony shows and buzz words but no real progress or understanding of how to reach goals.

If you were a legacy Pittsburgh employee you have no future with IT as is seen after *all* of the infrastructure managers were removed in the last 2 years. If you want to try for another job within Thermo, well good luck. 

If you are looking for work balance you will not find it here. Sure, IT operations requires a lot of hours and always has. But Thermofisher is completely willing to bury you day after day, every weekend, and holidays so that you can work on other peoples issues. They will berate you on technical calls involving 30 or more managers instead of letting you work with your service partner to fix the issue promptly.
Advice to Management
Management has forgotten 2 of the the companies core values. 
Involvement- you have not involved the Pittsburgh IT employees for 3 years! 
Integrity - The way you treat your employees is the exact opposite of integrity. So many very qualified IT staff members have left because of your utter BS that we are left with Life/new employees that are completely clueless.

Management is also willing to ignore its audit compliance and assume the risk of not completing key deliverables hoping no one will notice while snowing its external auditors. This started in 2016.
