","I am a disabled veteran and had to take an short intermittent FMLA for my disabilities.. soon as I returned from FMLA my supervisor started doing everything he could to put black marks on my sheet to get me fired. Even went as far as to put baseless negative remarks on my performance review. There are no checks and balances and it’s just his word against mine. I went to HR and they just blatantly took his side from the start. HR was clearly there just to help the company and not the employee! I caution anyone to speak with HR at this company.

Expect a system of no checks and balances, baseless discretion, and a heavy dose of favoritism and discrimination. 
Long work hours and difficult to balance life and work.
Advice to Management
Listen and treat employees equally! The current raise and promotion system is completely based off favoritism. No communication between upper management and lower level employees. The ethics in the Red Book has become completely useless. Discrimination is the biggest thing in the book and it’s rampant. “Speak up no retaliation” isn’t really a thing either. Because they just retaliate on you in discrete ways and HR backs them up. Supervisors need to be held accountable it’s not right the way I was treated here.

Negative Outlook
Approves of CEO
I worked at Eli Lilly and Company full-time for more than a year
Pros
-The company itself is great. Good mission, great benefits and pay for Indiana. Treats employees fairly and offers a lot of perks (on-site gym, dentist, daycare, etc.) If you want a stable job this is a good place to work
- Ethical company despite the perception of the industry
-Experience working in a massive, enterprise company with multiple internal organizations. This is good and bad
-Employee experience is designed to build long careers doing multiple roles in different organizations. But with caveats (see cons)
Cons
-USA Marketing is the assembly line of marketing organizations. Each role has a handful of duties that you do over and over again. Very repetitive and unchallenging. Incredibly structured in all ways which make it nearly impossible to try new things or do things differently. 

- Operating environment is a complete mess. So many hand offs, reviews, and people involved in simple tasks. Some of this is due to regulatory requirements and work volume, but mainly the company/leadership's inability to solve any problems. It adds more people to a workflows instead of making true improvements. Your job is figuring out how to get things done within Lilly vs. meeting customer needs through marketing

- Marketing culture is subtly bad. Everyone is nice, respectful and very smart, but to the point of arrogance. A lot of thinkers and very few do-ers. The 'Lilly-only' approach neglects and excludes outside ideas for marketing execution, structure, strategies, etc.

- If you're an experienced hire coming into the company your experience will not be valued. They'll tell you this isn't true but it definitely is 

- There is career progression but you have to play 'the Lilly game.' If you don't follow a standard career path your likelihood of moving up is low. You have to fit into a defined box that looks like other employees e.g. move from Sales into an LMA role into Marketing. The process of applying to internal jobs is incredibly political and not transparent. You have to know the hiring manager, understand the exact pain points of the brand, get letters of recommendation internally, get senior leader endorsement. None of this is DOCUMENTED. It's embedded within the culture and is an unwritten expectation. There are so many qualified people that don't get jobs they deserve

- Undergoing a re-org designed to improve marketing operating environment. This has been a huge mess. Not enough fat was cut and there is the same number of people and pass-through groups. It's ineffective without wholly new processes and technology. Lilly is adopting Agile and martech, but its ability to execute is historically bad so don't expect true change. The 'prioritized' re-hire period of the re-org was a joke and put many talented people into suboptimal roles

- All senior leaders are career Lilly employees and can't conceptualize new ideas/structures or take necessary risks to drive change

Simplify operations, reduce barriers in tactic production, and bring in outside thinking at the Sr. Director level and up. Take a customer-first approach to marketing vs. product.

Make sure they are qualified to lead and not just bosses. Put in place a mentoring program on the manufactoring side that would create better leaders for tomorrow.

Negative Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I have been working at Eli Lilly and Company full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Lilly promotes a very progressive environment where decisions are made through consensus. There are multiple promotions routes with a lot of flexibility to move. Lilly is very proud of the product they make and spend a lot of energy promoting the brand.
Cons
There has been high turnover since the most recent CEO took over in 2017. The trend in the engineering realm revolves around recruiting college grads for lower than average salaries and they tend to overwork them and there is high burnout. there are a lot of unhappy people that work here and morale can be very low in certain areas, especially in engineering fields. 
The core competencies of Lilly are R&D and Marketing, and engineering suffers as a result. Personally, I was continually disappointed with decisions and performance of Sr. Leadership and management. Life Sciences are highly regulated, and this adds a lot of bureaucratic processes that can be tedious to navigate.

","As an experienced (20+ years) professional I found it very difficult to bring forward new ideas or different ways of thinking. The ""Lilly way"" is very real. Lilly is a great opportunity for someone just coming out of school, or a few years into their career. If you are looking to truly make an impact in your functional area, and bring significant knowledge and experience, you may find it very difficult. Roles, viewpoints, and heirarchy can be quite limiting. There are many at Lilly who have been there for years who feel very constrained, yet compelled to stay because of the retirement benefits.

Tue Oct 01 2019, Technician,"Indianapolis, IN",Current Employee ,Which Lilly will you work for?,3,"Upper Lilly treats employes well, great vacation time, low starting pay that ramps up over time. There is real promise of change here. Good satisfaction in knowing that your work helps patients. A job you can throw yourself into.
","Your immediate supervisor can choose to ignore Lilly vacations, the bonus they promise to you is determined by your supervisor not Lilly. Supervisors can set up their own small business inside Lilly where Lilly handles the paperwork of your paycheck but they can say you work for them not Lilly. I have had more than one supervisor that ran their area like it was their own small business with its own set of rules, there's nothing you can do about it. Buck the system and they will dock your raise and your bonus. They want new ideas just not yours unless you are a fit. They are very slow to adopt new ideas while preaching they want diversity and diversity of ideas. They don't. Safety is a good thing here but I have witnessed a supervisor driving a forklift without a safety belt on just hours after a safety meeting where they told everyone ""it is company policy to always use proper Personal protective equipment including seatbelts while driving to forklifts"". My boss was up over 8 feet crawling around on equipment where he should have on fall protection, before I could say anything he mentioned it was in my best interest to not say anything. They talk a good game but don't follow their own rules. The rules are for the workers, if you bend the rules to be more productive then they are ok with that though. Some areas are more inviting to diversity than others. I have witnessed what I believe to be acts of age discrimination. Example of age discrimination: younger workers were told that if they got a degree they would be promoted, in that meeting was an older guy that had the needed degree but was not promoted he later retired without the promotion, in attendance was my supervisor, my manager and my director. They will bate and switch on you to get whatever they need. When I had health issues I was told that if my performance didn't improve that I would be fired. This is supposedly a company that is in the healthcare industry. No one ever suggested I see a doctor or that my health was an issue, no the only issue was productivity. I have witnessed managers bragging about firing 30+ year employees and how they did that in the past. They will replace you with a new younger ""you"" quickly and not care one bit about any health issues you have. They have a goal of zero human errors per year in the insulin manufacturing areas. if you have a human error they can dock your raise and your bonus. I was introduced to my lab partner that had went 17 years without making a single human error. You do the math. The real Safety goal is to not report when you get injured at work better to say it happened at home. I have reported this up to management and it falls on deaf ears I guess. I have had bosses that posted jobs for a person they wanted in the job, that's no problem, but the job was posted during a shutdown break when no one was around. When we cried foul we were told to ""take it to personnel and who would personnel believe?"" I was told ""I'm your manager, I've worked in personnel, so who will personnel believe?"" Apparently this issue got bad enough that Lilly now contracts with an outside group that takes care of personnel issues. They feel the need to teach us integrity what does that say? We are told to speak up if we see something wrong, but it's easier and better to announce on Glassdoor. Employees are muted.
Advice to Management
Do you know that people in management positions are doing these things? Do they know that age discrimination can put the entire company at risk of lawsuit or worse? Why would a company in the healthcare industry not care about their employees? If you don't care about the health of your employees then how can you say you care about the patients? What is the job of middle management? Provide a way for employees to report around middle management?

","Working at Eli Lilly was a terrible experience for me and I would not recommend working there unless you want to be a cog in the machine. In my opinion, they don’t treat their employees well and management doesn’t care. A lot of people seemed stressed out and not happy to be there. They also cut my health insurance the next day after resigning and didn't give it to the end of the month (like the majority of my former employers have). For a company involved in the conversation of rising costs of drugs, this gives me the impression they don’t care and only value the bottom line. Also, it wasn't as diverse as HR made it seem during the interview process. Worst place I have ever worked.

","Prior to the current CEO, senior management was weak and some manage by dishonest tactics. Many are still there while some good management left by early retirement. Instead of managing by willingness to implement the new CEOs strategy, they simply dumped “old” people so they could be replaced by younger workers. Some of the older (50+) workers who won’t change w the new strategy and who qualified for pensions stayed anyway. They will tell you they hire you for a career, but it isn’t true. Based on colleagues at other companies, their severance is not competitive. If you like to flex your schedule with work from home days be sure to ask at the time of offer since some management doesn’t support that (pharma seems behind the times).

Constant restructuring. Leadership is only focused on themselves and less on promoting talent. Promoting from within the company is less of a focus. Focus on diversity is a joke in conservative Indiana. Senior leadership has the appropriate diversity mindset, but middle management can not accept or adopt to a diverse culture.

","Very clickish work environment. Management in certain parts of the company are not objective, and care most about themselves. Performance appraisal process needs to be totally revamped. Advancement and lateral moves are very difficult. Company downsizes and restructures every so many years, and management are all given new titles.

Hard time recruiting top talent due to the physical hub location Indpls-little diversity. Beware of HR.

Rotate management so they aren't so stagnant and don't get too attached to their employees. It would be valuable for them to learn as many parts of the company as possible.

Job satisfaction varies widely depending on what division you’re in; in Managed Healthcare Services, it is basically a sweat shop and the people doing company critical work that isn’t “flashy” but must be done to ensure profits are not incentivized properly or fairly.

I have been working at Eli Lilly and Company full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Benefits are great, people are talented, current initiatives have the right intention
Cons
Employee experience across different groups vary significantly from the very positive to the very toxic. Work policies must enable D & I at every level and across all areas so that every employee feels valued. All employees should feel that their success and wellbeing is important to the company, and this needs to be consistent at the supervisor level, not just at the corporate level. There are people that feel the need to sacrifice their health and wellbeing, or are afraid to share ideas that could be perceived as challenging a supervisor or directive, in fear of retribution. Some supervisors are amazing at supporting their employees, while others need to understand the very negative impact of authoritarian management. I have experienced both.

Advice to Management
Lilly often speaks about the importance of people, yet the handling of employees by management (myself included) seemed very poor. I was often threatened by my manager with seemingly inappropriate threats along the lines of ""if things don't change, we might have to go in a different direction..."" while receiving perfect performance reviews.

My advice is to look at your upper management, and how they are handling their teams. Leading by the threat of being fired is entirely ineffective and is what eventually lead to my leaving the company.

The remuneration is on par with comparable positions in other companies in the Industry.
","Unfortunately there has been a quantum shift with the appointment of the new CEO from a once great place to work, to an organization that is focused on Wall St numbers, nepotism within senior management positions, and a culture of ""doing more with less"" - which actually means working longer hours than you are paid for, having minimal/no resources to do the most basic research required, a culture of feeling that you need to work 12+ hrs per day to be accepted. Unfortunately, due to very poor decisions by senior management (dogged pursuit of a legacy in Alzheimer's despite a clearly non-efficaceous candidate; purchasing Alzheimer's house for goodness sake!! - who thought that one up!!); multiple failures of ""me-too"" offerings in Phase 3; unnecessarily aggressive pricing decisions, and horrible public relations (insulin pricing in the US) the company now needs to compromise the work: life balance of its employees to cover massive OPEX discrepancies (ranked very poorly on Revenue to OPEX in the industry.
The current CEO is surrounding himself with ""yes"" people so there is little diversity of though at senior management level - advancement opportunities are dependent on being in with the ""right group"" rather than merit based - technical promotions are not based on technical merit and results but ""time in role"".
I have enjoyed my time at Lilly until now, however I would never consider joining Lilly until the current CEO is removed.

","Management needs to address the issue of lazy/unmotivated personnel, as hard workers are disheartened and are leaving. Compensation and review ratings no longer reflect performance other than 'Meets Expectations' or 'Does not Meet Expectations'. The high performer for example gets the same bonus as the average or even below average worker for the same job and level. Only horrendous employees get 'Does Not Meet Expectations', and often this does not even happen because it reflects on management to retain employees who consistently under-perform.
Advice to Management
It's tough to manage both people and work well. In some departments, middle management are oblivious to staff who are MIA. The people who slack off get away with it, and the strong performers are very demotivated by this behavior. Management could address it but choose not to, resulting in good talent leaving. You can see evidence of this by high turnaround in certain departments. Additionally, further evidence of this is a tremendous difference in the volume of work assigned and produced by people at the same level in the same department. Managers, you know you are ignoring this because you assign more work to certain people and the work gets done. But wake up, good people are leaving because of it.

You can see evidence of this by high turnaround in certain departments. Additionally, further evidence of this is a tremendous difference in the volume of work assigned and produced by people at the same level in the same department. Managers, you know you are ignoring this because you assign more work to certain people and the work gets done. But wake up, good people are leaving because of it.

Pros
As a pharmacist, a gig at a pharmaceutical company is a dream come true. Flexible work hours, work from home opportunities, work/life balance, healthy attitude around vacation, fun and fair travel opportunities, free gym membership, great facilities. Cost of living is great in the mid-west.
Cons
Pay on the medical side is just on the cusp of too low. Although I have received bonuses and raises in the 8 months I've been here. Work enjoyment is highly dependent on who your team members are and how you get along with them or whether you like your boss's management style. I feel somewhat unengaged at times, and worry that it may damage my career growth if I'm unable to get into a position where I'm more engaged sooner rather than later.

Show appreciation and rewords to those that produce results in meeting and excelling their sales goals instead of busy work to make the manager look good. Recognize the importance of relationships and trust with our customers. Don't worry so much about your next promotion or bonus but the success of the team.

Sun Feb 19 2017,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Blatant and Obvious Reverse Discrimination in Lilly Diabetes,5,"Sales Team is full of great people
Associate-level talent is generally pretty strong
Job Stability
","The reverse discrimination at Lilly Diabetes has reached a level where something must be done. Promotions no longer go to people who have earned them, but instead go to ""diverse"" candidates who are willing to move to Indiana. They don’t even need to actually be “diverse”; they just need to look like they are. In fact, the sales team receives videos saying things like, ""We need to promote people who aren't necessarily ready for positions in order to increase the diversity of our leadership team."" 

This practice is not only discriminatory; it is also disrespectful to the diverse people who have rightfully earned and deserve a promotion – who are many. These people now have to feel embarrassed that their coworkers believe their success is the result the company's meddling and not their own hard work. Diabetes Leadership is being discriminatory to the very constituency they are claiming to support. By promoting employees into jobs they aren’t ready for, they are actually increasing the likelihood that these people quit due to the pressure to succeed in a position they aren’t yet ready to handle.

It has gotten to a point where over the past 12 months, I can think of many ""diverse"" people who were hired into jobs they in no way deserve and a corresponding group of high-potential, white males that have quit as a result of realizing that Lilly Diabetes is not a meritocracy where promotions go to those who deserve them, but a place where those in power make decisions based on other factors.

What about HR you say. Shouldn't they be working as a check and balance to this kind of discriminatory social justice initiative? After all, Lilly is a publicly held company with a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders. It’s not an NGO with a stated mission of increasing diversity at the highest levels of corporate leadership. Sadly, HR is either complicit or willfully turning a blind eye to what has - at this point - become a very clear trend. 

The evidence is manifest. The demographic profile of the people who are quitting is exactly the same -- high potential white men who, by and large, have leadership experience from the sales team. At what point does HR get actually do something to take the business units' hiring practices back? How many top people need to quit before they take notice? Is it true that Lilly no longer needs to hire and promote the “best and brightest”?

I guess time will tell. As for me, I am actively looking for a way to get out of here and to go to a company where my hard work will be rewarded. Lilly Diabetes isn’t a good place to work for either minorities or non-minorities. Good luck getting to your goal in 2020 without the best talent you can find.

Pros

-Big corporate experience
-Some autonomy
-Brand recognition
Cons
-For those of you just graduating college you will find it hard to find others you can relate to because the average age tends to be more than 30+. 
-Established circles as many are veterans, so expect to cater to this
-Steep learning curve
-Too much work brought home 
-Compliance - you always need to watch what you say & do around your customers, competitors, & even your own partner
-Politics >> Performance

You may find yourself alone if you are young, like being incentivized on an individual level/performance, or if you are looking for a more progressive environment.

I worked at Eli Lilly and Company full-time for more than a year
Pros
- Relatively interesting work.
- Easy to appear smart.
- Not Valeant Pharmaceuticals.
- Industry headhunters respect brand.
- Great place to figure out what you do not want from an employer.
- That's all I have...
Cons
- Layoffs, pay freezes, and reduced bonuses (in any order, during any given period).
- Management wants to appear progressive, but aging culture clings to ""traditional values"" (e.g., xenophobia, racism, bigotry, etc.)
- Few management opportunities available for high performers.
- 'Good Ole Boys Club' maintaining status quo to protect each other while development lags and revenues suffer.
- Ancient (...and often flawed) industry perspectives (i.e. pursuit of the next blockbuster)
- Lost its spot as ""Top Employer"" in major rankings; Indicated by great people leaving every day.
Advice to Management
If you do not have a plan for high performers, do not recruit them. If you want them to stay, provide opportunities and compensation greater than those offered by headhunters. Within the past year, +50 employees earmarked for leadership - from Research to Commercial - have taken their talents elsewhere (... some have literally ""taken their talents to South Beach""). There are too many great biopharma companies (i.e. culture, career opportunities, location, compensation, etc.), and they are stealing your people with little effort. Happy for friends that moved on and worried for friends that feel trapped with few bipharma options in Indiana.

Be involved with employees so they can improve performance. Stop using PM as a weapon and be constructive about it. Stop using Deviations as a weapon. Use it as an opportunity for improvement.

I have been working at Eli Lilly and Company full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
I have been able to develop myself professionally through my 12 years there with management support. The healthcare benefits are still good, and in spite of the Great Recession and our own financial maelstrom from patent expiry, we have received some bonus every year. Long-time employees will gripe about the good old days, but I know we still have it better than so many other people. I also applaud Lilly's efforts to support diversity, particularly in the LGBT sector, including their very vocal opposition to the RFRA debacle here in Indiana.
Cons
The manufacturing areas have their own standards for sick time and personal leave that make it hard to care for sick family members on an intermittent basis. Areas supporting manufacturing may not be able to have the flexibility to balance work/family as they are essentially on call 24/7
Advice to Management
Manufacturing needs to address work/life balance better. I have seen so many younger people leave Tech Services and Quality support roles because they do not want to work 24/7 as expected in many of these roles. The company may not require that, but the expectation is there in many parts of manufacturing.

Pros
Lilly is a great company to work for. It is connected to the community, progressive in its policies, and competitive with benefits. Patients are clearly at the center of a majority of decisions and the company motto ""make it better"" is a true driving force.
Cons
Lilly is extremely risk-adverse. It is difficult and seems impossible to make true impact on the way things are done. Many inefficiencies exists and correcting them is a task that will wear you thin. The resources of the company are numerous, but the antiquated procedures that are required to be followed destroy budgets and result in simple activities racking up huge expenses.

Essentially, fixing the items that would be considered ""low hanging fruit"" still require a 40' ladder.

I have promoted a variety of products with them for over 20 years and have seen the respect for people in the field by the home office in Indy.

They've never been a company to offer low base and crazy bonus structure. It sends the wrong message and drives uber aggressive behavior.

I have been working at Eli Lilly and Company full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Lilly has truly turned itself into a customer-focused company and by and large makes decisions with the customer in mind (customer meaning both healthcare professionals and the ultimate consumer of the product). Management is predominantly supportive of employee growth and upward mobility.
Cons
As is common in today's pharma industry, Lilly can be quick to pull the switch and ""reallocate"" employees which too often necessitates leaving the company. Having lost patent protection of several blockbuster drugs over the past 5 years Lilly's future precariously hinges on the approval of several products currently in phase 3 studies.
