In over 40 years in manufacturing, this is the absolute worst managed company that I have ever seen. Too many levels of management preventing timely action at the plant level; micromanagement experts (LOL), any communication must take place with a powerpoint presentation and a worthless/time consuming meeting. The only concern of corp and mid level managers is ""will this make me look good to my boss?"" I wish them all the worst of luck!

","There is a major disconnect between the different levels in the corporate structure. Upper management doesn't communicate to the lower levels and will blame middle management for shortcomings. Upper management is lacking the needed skill to lead. The workplace has become very toxic with bad-mouthing of the different structural levels. And the miscommunication is company-wide. There often fights between departments (purchasing, engineering, manufacturing) and even globally (NA, Eur, Mex). It seems like the company is working against itself and everyone is quick to place the blame on others. Add in the ever-present and decaying product quality and it seems like no one is ever really happy.

 Board of Directors

Tenneco, Inc.

500 North Field Drive

Lake Forest, IL 60045

To my Fellow Directors:

It is with regret that I write to inform you that I hereby resign as a director of Tenneco, effective immediately. While I have appreciated my time on the board, you have made decisions with which I strongly disagree and which are inconsistent with my views on what is best for Tenneco and its shareholders.

My dissatisfaction with the board should come as no surprise. In October, we discussed my letter to the board in which I expressed my concerns regarding Tenneco’s direction and the dangers of continuing with the board’s strategy at the time. Had swift action been taken at that time, Tenneco would have been in a much better situation coming into today’s COVID-19 crisis.

Based on the last year of discussions, I have little confidence that my input will result in meaningful board actions and it is not productive for me to keep advocating for change if my suggestions continue to fall on deaf ears.

Tenneco is a world class company with tremendous products, technology and employees. I wish you and our hard working employees the best.

Sincerely,

Thank you for your review. As we navigate through these unprecedented times, we would like to refer you to a weekly update letter from CEO, Brian Kessler, which can be found at https://www.tenneco.com/overview/covid19_ceo_letter/: 

""In our locations where our team is required to work, we have taken precautions to implement rigorous cleaning and sanitation protocols. In an effort to further protect our team we are also performing wellness checks on our team members, including taking their temperatures at the beginning of each shift, and implementing changes within the plant to comply with social distancing requirements. Additionally, members of our global teams that are able to work from home have been doing so and will continue to until their local community guidelines allow them to return to their work locations. We continue to enforce travel restrictions and other guidelines for self-quarantine. Our team members are our greatest strength, and we are doing everything within our reach to ensure their health and safety."" 

Please rest assured that we do not take the health and safety of our workers lightly, and we encourage you to take any ongoing concerns to your onsite manager immediately. Thank you again for your continued service and commitment during these unprecedented times.

In a global role, you are required to run interference across all time zones and your three jobs for one salary turns into slightly more than minimum wage with all of the hours you put in. Also no one will ever say thank you and your bonus will be a fraction of what it should be. Management also will not tell you about the bonus payout if it looks to be less than promised. 

Everyone was openly looking for a job in lake forest except the executives. The C suite walks around like peacocks. Morale is terrible. People are dropping like flies left and right and they don’t even have jobs to go to AND some of those people were key positions. Read: No Job is better than a job at Tenneco. Senior management made an engagement committee and they are trying to make Tenneco fun to work at. But work cannot be fun when you literally have to do the job of three people for slightly more than minimum wage. 

 the federal mogul integration/spin-off of driv is unpleasant. The two cultures are very different and it kind of feels like working in a case study from your MBA. 

Also Fox News is always on in the CEOs office which explains to me why there is no diversity in leadership positions.

","It was one of the worst environments I have ever worked in....many employees are so frustrated they are looking for new roles. While many reviews will discuss the financial state of the business (even some that have been deleted recently) the only thing I find worse than the financial state is the way the employees are being treated. Many executives lead their departments with a chauvinistic style of leadership that make employees afraid to speak up. Often times leaders blamed their poor performance on those who were juggling multiple projects and competing priorities that led to many employees to seek employment elsewhere. Some of us even jumped ship without another offer in hand. There are no women in leadership positions left within Tenneco which I think speaks for itself. I am hopeful the board is looking at not only the financial aspects but the current morale and engagement of employees left and the current style of leadership that is taking place at the very top levels.

Great Job Security
Bonuses pay out regularly
Executive team has great vision for future growth
Future IT Growth may precipitate change
","No accountability; under-performance, poor leadership, and toxic behavior goes unaddressed.

CISO provides conflicting feedback, shifts blame, directly insults subordinates, creates conflict with peer teams, puts down previous employees, publicly chastises team members, does not honor calendar invites (all calendar invites must be followed-up with 1-on-1).

CISO pontificates, picks on small details, and interrupts regularly. It is common to need multiple follow-ups to get through a small presentation. Quotes include ""I have not been wrong in 40 years, I'm not going to start now"", ""I have socks older than <person's name>"", ""My grandchildren are older than your children"", ""Anyone could have done that, it doesn't take a brain surgeon""

4 people quit within 6 months and named the CISO as their #1 reason

CIO has ZERO IT experience, he was previously a manufacturing plant manager

Company values are discussed but are effectively meaningless within IT

Leaders refuse to leave meeting rooms even after their reserved time has expired.

Having so many contract workers detracts from continuity and quality. Just-in-time IT service does not work at Tenneco. 

Nothing happens without a formal project (and all associated overhead)

Unreasonable expectations for individual contributors. Performance reviews do not account for what can be reasonably achieved.

IT over-relies on a handful of ""Key"" contributors. If 5 specific people left Tenneco, IT services would be severely degraded.

There is significant focus in capitalizing work. It feels forced and dishonest to capitalize labor that is clearly run-state work.
Advice to Management
-Replace toxic and aloof leaders
-Hold leaders accountable to the company values
-Get unbiased 3rd-party opinion of CISO and CIO
-Invest in permanent personnel, Contractors are 3x as expensive and less than 1/2 as effective. IT does not have enough people in the core teams.
-Significant efficiency can be gained by centralizing IT functions. There is a lot of duplication of effort and unnecessary overhead.

I was able to complete my Master's degree while there and was paid for. The company allowed me to work on other functional department projects. As an engineer, I worked on marketing, sales, accounting, and others. I was always busy and felt proud of my contributions. 
Salary was decent. Benefits average for the industry. 
Gregg has done a good job turning it around from Mark. He likes to use facts and figures to make a call compared to a knee jerk decision.
","Very typical automotive that is publicly traded. 4th quarter expense lock down and sometimes too focused on cost cutting. They roll out high level strategies to all the division's regardless if it makes sense for that division at that time. I was there during a rather big layoff and no input to which of my employees should be kept. For most people in the auto industry, this should not be a surprise. 

Employee recognition was minimal. My general manager was one to take all the credit. I don't think this applies to all the different divisions from what I saw.
Advice to Management
Look at each division separately when establishing goals and changes. Some are very different than others and division managers should be more involved in the analysis and direction (or get managers that aren't afraid to speak up with data indicating otherwise).

Salaries and bonuses are very competitive. Benefits are acceptable, but don't stand out. As an automotive supplier, Tenneco gets good discounts for new car purchases.
","Within the IT organization, many in the top levels are unqualified to lead or even manage. They've been in their positions for many years and don't know or care how badly things are run. IT's inability to make and meet its commitments lead to poor morale and high turnover. 

Key shortcomings:
- Poor planning, prioritization and execution leads to overworked staff, delays and budget overruns. Of the dozens of projects underway, not ONE is on schedule
- Lack of service orientation
- No resources focused on quality. There are lots of metrics; most are wrong.
- Top-down and bottom-up communication is almost non-existent 
- Leadership IS non-existent
- Archaic and arcane processes and procedures hide ownership and responsibility
- Much of the IT infrastructure and tools should have been replaced years ago, leading to slow and unreliable systems
