Some truly great people work at the company, and there are opportunities for interesting work, but TJX has a hard time hanging onto great new talent with their archaic policies and ways of working.

There is opportunity to work on different teams and varying workstreams due to the nature of it being a multi-brand company.
","TJX talks a big game about being people-first and great advocates for their employees, but they are really behind the curve.
- Benefits and pay are not competitive for Boston area. Vacation days only accrue after 10 YEARS of employment, expensive health insurance, long 401k vesting period, not a fully paid maternity leave
- No promises for flexibility with work from home in the future, even though the company has done well throughout Covid
- Promotions seem to be based on time worked, as opposed to talent. A lot of lifetime employees have been promoted through the ranks and are out of touch or bad leaders. The culture does little to encourage innovation
- Contract employees are treated poorly and strung along, even when their work is essential to their teams
- Executives hoard earnings for themselves

","Benefits package is absolutely the worst I've had. Pension, healthcare etc. is the bare minimum. Salary is average, then it rests on bonus and share options which appear generous but have high charges.
Management day to day were absolutely terrible. IT executive lacks direction and is rooted in legacy - strong resistance to change. Management style is very old fashioned and dictatorial. New ideas are rejected.
Poor management leads to very outdated technical environment, TJX is well behind the curve on most technologies. This is not a place to hone your career on new ideas or tech - everything is ten to twenty years behind the curve.
Investment in career is minimal. There is lots of internal training available, but this to TJX is a new idea, really starting in 2019. The training is then not supported with strong career investment. Promotion is very hard, largely because there are people in key bottle-neck positions sitting still for very long periods, with no ambition to move (due to previously mentioned generous stock options.)
TJX touts its culture but in fact hides behind empty phrases whilst allowing psychopathic managers to run amok, defended by 'don't mess with the model'. 
Just to cap everything with TJX, in hindsight, I also noticed that this is far and away the whitest company every. Especially up at senior management level, diversity is clearly something for others to practice.

","Management is a joke, if you are in this position you get treated like you are not even a person. One of my co-workers used to say we were ""just another butt in the seat"" and it is true. People come into this position because it looks good on a resume, get paid NOTHING for a year, treated terribly, work their butt off, and then leave and do 5x better - including myself. In 6 months, I watched 10 people of a 45 person team quit or leave, and without fail every single one of them got into a better position and company. You are pretty much your buyers slave/scapegoat for every problem people higher up than you have. They constantly hold promotions over your head as threat to not doing what they want, but in reality, no one in this position gets promoted anyway. I saw one girl get out in the year I was there - ONE. Out of at least 16 people who applied. But who you know who does get the position? CO-OPs from Northeastern they can hire and write off as a longer term employee to raise their retention rate. The only way you ""survive"" at this company is if you act like a incredibly mean and immature middle schooler. The gossip is RAMPANT and actually impacts whether or not you do well here. I have never been straight up bullied by a bunch of ugly (inside and out) mid 30's-50's group of women until coming here. These people have a ego the size of Mars because they are the few people who don't leave, and eventually get promoted. For some reason, this makes them think they are better than everyone else and they make you know it. The best decision I ever made in the year I worked there was to not continue working there. I got nothing out of my experience there except an appreciation for what a healthy work environment looks like out of there.

Give your hourly employees decent raises. Stop/lessen the tchotchkes and reduce bonuses to give hourly employees decent raises. Unfortunately, when I go to pay the bills, the gas company will not take a TJX tote bag. 

Cut out the excess levels of middle-management. They do not add value. They spend their time trying to justify their position by micromanaging the people trying to do actual work. 

When associates try to raise issues using the Open Door policy, don't just support management. I understand it might be hard to admit that someone was promoted into a position they were not qualified for - but it happens. Admit the mistake, fix it, and move on. It seems like once a person achieves management level, they are Teflon coated.

Thu Oct 10 2019, Senior Allocation Analyst,"Framingham, MA",Former Employee ,Drink the Kool-Aid or Get Out,9,"-huge, recognizable brand 
-no one actually works and just ""goes to stores"" to claim all the good stuff that gets sent to stores before the actual customers have a fighting chance
-flex hours available
-gym on-site
-summer fridays
","Drink the Kool-Aid or Get Out was essentially the advice I got here from multiple managers. I can't speak for the entire company but for particularly Planning & Allocations, if you aren't a white female in your early to mid 20s, don't bother trying to grow a career in planning or buying here. I'm not accusing the company or the brand of encouraging a predominantly white environment or discriminating against other ethnicities. In fact, I think TJX has many diversity committees and outside of planning/buying there seems to be a better balance of non-whites vs whites. I am saying that within this area, those who end up staying/becoming successful/moving quickly through the positions happen fit the persona of a white female, who is a recent grad from Penn State or Northeastern and can keep up with the lunch table talks of diets, fitness, Kardashians, and office gossip. 

The fact that everyone in Planning/Buying talks, dresses, acts, and leads in the exact same manner should have been the first red flag. The fact that they quickly promote those who follow suit and learn how to mimic their Planning Managers' mannerisms should have been the second. The fact that the training months have all been focused on ""relationship before task"" should have been the ultimate red flag that almost no one (and usually those in position of power) knows how to really do their jobs and in fact, focus on ""building relationships"" (either talking trash about others or asking about weekend plans) with others as the tactic to get noticed and get promoted. 

So, if you're a white female in your early 20s trying to start a retail career and can drink this Kool-aid enough to last a year or so here and hopefully get promoted to at least Associate Planner: absolutely work here. It is a big company, huge brand, and you'll definitely meet girls here that you'll become close friends with. If you're serious about actually learning how to manage and plan inventory and gain skills that will actually help you in your career of a planner or buyer, avoid this place.
Advice to Management
Don't reward those who just know how to talk to people. Actually look at the quality of their work. And for those who know how to talk to people and do great work, look at how they lead their team and how they empower their analysts. 

Stop putting buyers on a pedestal.

","Unrealistic expectations, most analysts work at least 50 hours a week, if not 60-70 while managers leave at 5pm sharp every night. Constant gossip, very cut throat coworkers. Odd “behind closed doors” communication styles and unspoken rules on what you can and can’t say/do around office. Staying quiet and not voicing stress or concerns is the only way to get promoted. Despite extensive hiring process, most tasks are mindless - copy pasting numbers into antiquated programs and hitting the same keyboard sequence over and over daily. The critical thinking and analysis preached in job description rarely happens because Days are eaten up by completing menial tasks for support teams.
Advice to Management
Enforce the culture you preach. The environment has become increasingly tense in the several years that I’ve been with the company. Actually show employees appreciation and acknowledge their potential. Whether or not upper management knows it, the expectation for analysts is to keen their mouths shut and just “get it done”. Every analyst I have seen voice sincere concerns about workloads, unrealistic expectations, or even make suggestions for possible improvements or changes they think will help the work environment has been punished with bad reviews, a reputation as a troublemaker, and being given the worst team responsibilities.

","IT...all of it! If you consider yourself innovative and posses a learning mindset than avoid this place. You will most certainly get frustrated and leave at some point.

IT is a collection of unskilled and entitled ""leaders"" that have risen through the ranks due to years of service or because they can talk. Anyone with a shred of technical skill immediately realizes that these people possess zero IT skills and would not stand a chance of being considered for their current roles with any external company. Due to this dynamic one can be promoted into a C level role without any IT skill whatsoever. The vast majority of senior leaders are in roles well beyond their capability and will not understand anything you say if you use even basic technical terms. The real technologist are tired of dumbing it down. 

If you are a good actor that likes to talk this is the place for you.
Advice to Management
1) Turn over the senior leadership team and bring in people capable of recognizing the difference between a technologist and and an academic. This is IT after all.
2) Break down the silos and flush out those with a legacy mindset fencing off their turf. This is most of the org.
3) Create a performance culture where talent and real innovation is recognized and rewarded. Hint...cloud services are the cloud providers innovation, not yours.
4) Stop describing the the function as ""Systems"", it's 2019 already.
5) To the business, stop letting IT waste funding on high priced consultants and inefficient implementations. Hold back funding and hold them accountable. 
6) Reward efficiency, after learning to recognize it.

Also did I enjoy hearing a bunch people talk about how they were gonna vote for trump and that he just needs ""a better way of expressing his views"" NOT REALLY but that was probably the BEST thing that happened to me there. I would consistently be asked to do things not in my job title, but also got punished for doing said things. I had buyers pretend I actually was invisible...like im not kidding it was like middle school. Im not a weak person but man I cried in the bathroom, at my car during lunch, on the way to work, on the way home from work, and on sunday nights cause i know i had to go back monday morning. My managers did not help me or coach me properly nor did they stand up for me professional when buyers were being UNPROFESSIONAL twoards me. Also thanks for letting a supplier basically become obsessed with me and call me a million times....this supplier also asked me to show them photos of what I looked like because they just ""wanted to know who the person on the other side of the phone was and looked like..."" that was fun ( it was not fun it was hell). honestly I cant write out all the bad, unprofessional, and hostile thigs that happened to me because Im not JK rowling...I cant write a 7 book series about my long challenging fight for freedom but voldemort and the death eaters of TJX...literally my life was Merchandising Assisant and the Dealthy Buyers. I think they actually split their souls into horcruxes that they put into the supplier samples. Idk It was just a BAD hostile envoirment for me, but it was not that way for everyone. I saw people there who also hated it but I saw people who loved it. Im 100% willing to believe I got a bad batch of Buyers and a not so great category...but also nothing really excuses their actions twoards me it was just nasty and I felt like I was on my own. HR, my managers, other co works couldnt or wouldnt do anything to help. I ended up needing therapy and am writing this review almost 2 years after I have left tjx...because its 11:16pm and im having nightmarish flashbacks and cant stop thinking about the horrible things that happened. I am actually being HAUNTED almost 2 years after leaving TJX...cool...great. If u want to work here thats up to you. I hope it works out. Its not a bad company It just has bad people that i had the unfortunate pleasure of working with for a year a 6 months. Do I suggest it to people, no i dont. Do I think you could work there and have a good experience, sure. Am I still haunted by my time there 100% but such is life. I still remember all my buyers names...I sometimes will spot 1 or 2 of them when im in the mall minding my own buisness and I just walk out because even seeing their faces makes me feel sad. wow thats depressing but its true. Maybe someday ill be over it...but also do people get over being treated like your dumb for being a woman or being treated less than for being black? not sure ill let u know in another 2 years. so...ya...goodluck, you may need it.

","I had one manager that would make inappropriate jokes that just made me and other girls uncomfortable, people got away with non-professional behavior a lot, some managers care and some don't. I had one manager that would yell at employees for no reason in front of shoppers and embarrass you because you had a question or didn't know something about another department (very poor leadership skills across the board for management). You also had to push for people to sign up for the TJX credit card on every purchase and could not take the first no for an answer (it usually took the customer saying no multiple times before it was okay for you to give up) or else you would get yelled at. It was an okay job if you don't plan to take it seriously. 

Also, you'll deal with some interesting and sometimes rude people. It's customer service so that's expected but I definitely got some weird stories of this job.
Advice to Management
Treat your employees right. Act professional. Most shoppers don't want to sign up for the credit card so allow your cashiers to take the first no as an answer, you're just going to annoy customers.

","None of the managers are on the same page about anything and associates stay confused because one manager says one thing while another manager says something totally different. They are very ruthless. They take their stresses of their job out on employees. They like to make up their own rules. Only certain people can get away with doing certain things. They push and push and push for you to get credit card applications and act like it's your fault when there isn't any. It's understandable that it's a goal but it's unrealistic because not everyone wants a credit card, especially though a bank that has horrible consumer ratings, high APRs, and you only save 10% on your first purchase and that is only when you are approved. Many other retail stores credit cards offer much greater benefits. If you are not available to work nights and weekends, they will schedule you to work anyway and tell you it's not their problem while people without kids and families get day shifts and good hours while those with families only get 2-3 days a week, lucky to get 20 hours a week.

Prepare to be glued to your desk and computer screen crunching numbers a computer could in 5 seconds all day long. If I stood up to go the bathroom more than 3 times a day and worked over a 9 hour day, people were convinced I wasn't at my desk enough.

This is a math job, not a buyer training program. And yes, a computer could easily do it a million times faster, but instead you will have to. You will become close with your team, but to management you're a number unless you bake everyone something every single week. Seriously if you want to get promoted faster it's all about sucking up.

Because this job was not at all what I was told it would be, I left. While working there I got several offers to do something I was more interested in that paid higher. While the turnover for the whole company is low, it is very high for allocation analysts. Usually a little less than half of the nearly 80 they bring in will quit by the end of the year. I day I quit, three others also did.
Advice to Management
Change your ""training program"" for buyers so it's more product focused. If you don't that's fine, but make the responsibilities of analysts clear in the interview. If I had known the true function of what my job was going to be, I never would have taken it in the first place.

Board member in a member of the TJX Board AND that of Cognizant. I'm sure there's some conflict of interest there.

They've conducted skill surveys to determine who to lay off. They also had a mass layoff globally of 450+ Infrastructure and Operations associates, and outsourced all of their jobs to Cognizant. They instructed those that were not laid off to stop interacting with those that were.

 Cross training was via webex to India. Onboarding Cognizant staff has minimal training for critical systems in TJX

The HR staff strong armed people to stay by holding their severances until TJX was ready to transition to Cognizant.

I get it ""good customer service"" but the amount they expect us to do an care is not fair for such the low pay. It's a good job for those who want little extra pocket change but that's it. In today's world you need a better paying job that will keep you fed and pay the bills. And that whole transparency, I didn't feel like I could talk openly to some management.

the open door policy that is discussed when hired is great! however, I never found that to be the actual case. It's important for high level managers to be open to others' opinions and suggestions on change & improvements. there is no reason to hire management from outside the company if that person cannot ever influence positive change. it was extremely difficult to manage & mentor my team when it was well deserved, since everything was dependent on ""up the ladder"" decisions, including when they could get raises/promotions/etc. this makes it very difficult and disheartening to manage your own team members.

TJX is known for having a fantastic company culture within the retail sector and unprecedented tenure among its employees.) The organization continues to grow and post great numbers year after year.
","As the organization grows, employees' experiences can differ VASTLY based on the management of their department. Where it was previously common to see employees remain with the organization for decades, many are now being driven away by toxic environments and lack of leadership integrity. While employees are made to believe that they are the organization's top priority, the simple truth is that employee satisfaction problems and management issues are very easy to hide and ignore in such a large corporation. Below senior management levels, employees are easy to replace and are therefore not supported as they should be when issues arise. Those who remain with the organization wrestle with frustration as issues are overlooked, but remain in hopes that the ship will be course corrected.
Advice to Management
Preserve your reputation and keep your employees as your #1 priority. Don't overlook issues with turnover. HR, ensure your managers are trained appropriately and that they embody the integrity the organization says it expects and requires of its leaders.

I love the atmosphere of giving back during the Holidays and the different theme of events that are run throughout the year.
","Zero transparency and lots of dishonesty! Expectations are not always clear and Managers are often too busy to spend any time with you. Contractors are not treated well. Lack of good management and if you happen upon the wrong Manager, you can kiss your career there goodbye. Some Managers have way too much power, while others have none. Chances of getting hired from a Contractor role are very slim. Worst place I have ever worked and I have a long work history with no issues anywhere else. Working at TJX is like working in the Wild West.

Treat your contractors better and train your Managers to have some human skills. Managers should know how to treat their subordinates and know how to ""Manage"". Your employees are only going to be as good as they are treated.

Since there are so many long term employees clogging everything up, not only can you not get anything done, but there are no opportunities for advancement.

Horrific work experiences I have ever gone through. The planning department is like working in a sorority but with ""adults"" , often with children managing children (not just in the age sense. Often times more ""mature "" managers act out in childish ways such gossiping about members of their team to other members of their team and employing the silent treatment to subordinates when upset). I endured two years of mental anguish at this company, left to feel incompetent and as a misfit though often dubbed with the excuse of not having the right ""personal brand"" to fit in with my team. This phrase is used often and is employed to ensure that the P&A environment caters to exactly the type of employee they are looking for with no diversification - white, female, vapid , with a penchant for gossip and immaturity . The revolving door of employees that go through this department Is not only what I would assume to be extremely detrimental to the company but also somehow a ""non issue"" as this is something that management refuses to have addressed . Before starting at TJX, I had received several warnings from peers that had heard similar horror stories from the company but I did not pay attention, believing that such a well respected organization in our community could not possibly have this sort of reputation behind closed doors. I implore you, for your own sake, to go elsewhere when looking for a job .

","The IT organization needs to grow up. Quite possibly one of the most immature and inefficient IT organizations I have ever been a part of in over 20 years.

If you are the type of person who strives to be ""retired in place"" then I suggest working in Merchandising, or Stores, or Supply Chain IT.

Entrenched Sr. Management has little idea how to move IT in the right direction. Some nepotism has resulted in young people being promoted beyond their capabilities or experience. Culture does not reward achievement but relationships with the right Sr.management. HR in IT has been tasked with ongoing Performance Management which manifests itself in continuous small layoffs, often selecting the best people for layoff because they somehow don't fit the byzantine TJX culture of ""don't mess with the model"". Yet everyone knows the model in IT Is broken. Many, many unhappy people who have been demoted under the new Plan, Build, Run model from management positions to individual contributors.

Not part of a union, which I prefer because it meant not having such fees taken out of your paycheck. 

I got paid accurately and on time.

I had a clear sense of what criteria I was being evaluated on. They are big on enforcing policies. Basically, the way you advance into management is by following their rules really well even though they are halfway dumb. But be aware, if you advance into a coordinator or manager role, your main function is to police the associates to make sure they're following all the rules that you probably think are dumb. There is no room for any kind of influence beyond that. If you have a head on your shoulders, you'll be screaming on the inside. But I list this as a plus because it's the nature of the beast. I've worked with companies without clear policies, and that is way worse. Here, all of the managers agree on policies and that's what allows them to effectively expand. 

I reported a sexual harassment incident. It was handled fairly well. Way better than when I was working in a restaurant and a similar thing happened. If you're gonna work for minimum wage, choose a big corporation like this where the managers are afraid of lawsuits. I think that if you're a woman/LGBTQ/minority/disabled you have fairer treatment at a place like this than
","Nobody has a set schedule, regardless of whether you're an associate or a manager. The schedule was supposed to be announced two weeks in advance, but normally it wasn't announced till about 4 days in advance. It's seriously hard to handle other commitments (jobs, kids, classes, doctor appointments) with a system like this. And your hours were unpredictable -- maybe 12 hours one week and 25 hours the next. Sometimes the schedule would be changed after being posted and nobody would tell you that your shift changed. 

They make you do the same checkout procedure involving asking a bunch of questions to every single customer. This means you get scolded if a customer buys something small like a bag of chips and you don't ask them if they want to open a credit card. The managers don't care that they are putting the customer service staff in the position of habitually annoying their customers. When supervisors weren't around I used my judgment to selectively ask only certain patrons if they wanted to open a credit card, and i opened more accounts than most of my peers. But they are more interested in whether you are following the script than in whether you are getting results.

An associate ended up applying for one, just so we could leave that night. I've worked with the company for quite some time, and never once felt the need to complain, until now. I understand the need for opening credit cards, but I also understand that some days, it doesn't happen. And now management is going to punish us for it?

","Too much pressure ""selling"" credit cards at ungodly interest rates. Rules change from manager to manager, each one wanting things done ""their"" way. You play by the rules and tell customers that we can not return an item, and coordinator or manager comes along and tells them we will take return back which leaves the associate looking like a doofuss. Raises are based more on what the managers think and feel about you and not necessarily whether you are doing your job correctly. They only give out raises once a year and they are only anywhere from a nickle an hour to possibly thirty cents an hour. Open door policy usually gets you more scrutiny from everyone because they don't take your word in any situation. It must be proved to them.

Advice to Management
Pay attention to how associates treat customers especially those that may not be dressed for shopping.

Thu Aug 13 2015,N/A,"Framingham, MA"," in Framingham, MA","Run, as fast as you can, from Talent Acquisitions",9,"Overall, TJX seems like a great place to work. They are company based on relationships and really care about their employees. The benefits are great, as well as the compensation, and the work/life balance can't be beat. They have a really long tenure because they let people lead the lives they want to outside of work. 

If you're looking for in slower paced environment, and I mean extremely slow-paced, where you work a typical 9-5 and along side some really nice people, this could be a great place for you. Just stay away from Talent Acquisitions all around.
","Now on the flip side, TJX has some issues overall just like any other organization. It is an extremely siloed company, so nobody knows who is doing what or how to partner with other teams on projects. Add a really old-school mentality and a dash of terrible technology and you have a recipe for a really difficult time getting any projects done. TJX also needs to work on a diversity program and take it seriously. When I left it was barely talked about, and seemed to be an initiative to do just to do it. When in fact it is such an important topic with a real impact on the business. 

Now specifically to TA, what a mess. Have you ever watched a dog chase its tail for 10 minutes only to get distracted by a squirrel, and when it chases after said squirrel it runs into a tree because it's so disoriented? Me neither but that is the best way I can describe how Talent Acquisition functions at TJX. TA is rapidly expanding, new projects are being propelled at people who aren't prepared for them by any means, and when you think something is finally starting to work out the senior leadership changes directions on a whim and you have to start at square one. 

Finally, remember all the nice things I said about work/lilfe balance and leadership really caring about your development? That doesn't apply to this department because senior leadership is a stark contrast to those fundamental ideals, and the goal is to bring in other people who don't fit into this company and move people who do out of it.

","I started at the TJX Companies directly after graduating college. The position is marketed as product driven, this is true for your first month of ""training"" or as they call is ""MDP."" During your training you essentially learn a minimal amount from a team that knew a minimal amount of information themselves. You take part in a lot of store visits and and shopping of the stores and competitor stores. After this two month ""training"" you are thrown into the job where is it the complete opposite of training and your future is determined by the manager you have and the team you have. Half of being successful is not about knowledge, skills, or experience. Half of your success is determined by if you conform to the idea of what a TJX employee should look like. (Extremely loud and excited at all times, extremely nosey asking every person about every personal detail of their life and also keeping a notebook of these details in order to remember, and walking/acting/talking as if you are a high school clique when it comes to the team you are placed on. I was at TJX for 8 months and had three different managers and two different teams during that time. They often move people around. Once I had my third manager, the challenge truly began. Because I did not conform into this person that ""drank the kool-aid) my manager began to create a hostile environment. I felt bullied and began to develop anxiety on a daily basis. FYI human resources does not care if about this sort of thing. Once there is an issue, they will play mind games with you until you quit (they also do not like to fire people). I started last May and a year later more than 50% of my class that started with me has left the company. Many people I started with have also been bullied, manipulated, or ""encouraged"" to quit.

Sat Jun 06 2015,Anonymous,"Framingham, MA",Current Employee ,Family Leave Policies Leave Associates Wanting More,7,"TJX has a maternity policy, that is a pro. The policy itself needs improvement. I am a corporate associate and have experienced maternity leave at TJX. The description below is reflective of existing 2015 family leaves policies.
","TJX's Maternity policy is complicated and could be more comprehensive. There are no official paternity or adoption leave policies. 
The Federal Medical Leave Act protects your job for 12 weeks following the birth of your child. This does not mean it is paid. TJX's maternity leave policy is contingent on enrollment in short term disability. After a year of service you are eligible for paid maternity leave through short term disability. Short term disability provides partially paid leave for 6-8 weeks. 8 weeks for cesarian delivery and 6 weeks for vaginal birth. Short term disability covers 100% of pay for 4 weeks and 60% of pay for weeks 5-8. Accrued sick time hours may be used during the medical leave portion of maternity leave (that first 6-8 weeks) to cover the 40% gap. 
For the second portion of maternity leave (4-6 additional weeks under FMLA protection) only accrued vacation hours may be used to supplement pay. Depending on the time of year and length of service with the company, an associate may have anywhere from 0-4 weeks vacation hours accrued. It's typical for an associate to have at least 2 weeks unpaid during the 12 weeks of FMLA maternity leave.

All of a sudden one evening, I was pulled in to the office and told I was being let go because I wasn't finishing the training goals in time. This was in spite of the fact that I volunteered to take the tests sooner than mandated in order to accomplish what they wanted.

It is my firm belief that they let me go due to the fact I could possibly be deployed. Which, by the way, is illegal. Had I had a bit more proof of this taking place, I would have taken it much higher up the food chain and sought answers, perhaps legally.

The newest employees are not only trained incorrectly but lack discipline, especially in the attendance department. The people who should be fired are not and are actually favored by this manager. I was always making up for the work abandonment of others by working maximum hours per week (about 35). this manager began cutting my hours and not allowing me to pick up shifts, he decided he would rather be understaffed than have a hard worker getting stuff done. The other managers would still call me in and have asked me to come back to work. However, I will never work for this manager again.

Thu Aug 14 2014, Human Resources,"Framingham, MA",Former Employee ,Hard to Move Up,1,"TJX has a lot of pros. Overall, they have an amazing home office with a lot of perks like two gyms, an amazing cafeteria, and a indoor golfing range. Also since it is so big you have a really wonderful sense of community. They also provide very good benefits and 401K opportunities.
","They cons are great. I found the company to be very hard to move up in. They also gave some of the worst raises I have ever gotten. I would have a wonderful review and a really bad raise and the excuses was always ""we are an off price retailer"". I never got that since they were making millions all over the world.
Advice to Management
Have better opportunities to move up and give more realistic raises.

Sun Jul 27 2014, Senior Allocation Analyst,"Framingham, MA",Current Employee ,High pressure and catty work environment,2,"- clearly mapped out career path
- job security
- good 401k and health insurance plans 
- sufficient PTO
- interesting types of work (product oriented)
","- when business isn't good, people are quick to point fingers
- no management training = bad/uneducated managers
- they try to train people but consistently leave employees more confused than before the training. 
- very old and outdated IT systems that impede productivity rather than improve it. The entire IT infrastructure for merchandising makes the job far more difficult than it should be.
- HR is extremely misleading about duration of career path at point of hire
- very high turn over. Only 8/33 members of my new employee class still remaining at the company after only 2 years.
Advice to Management
- improve trainings -- better courses, better instructors. Having an educated workforce will drive success in the future. Focus on human capital development to improve business process rather than lousy, unproven, time wasting strategies that show little to no benefits or progress 
- offer more trainings.
- improve IT systems and the communication between programs
- remember that we are selling clothes not curing cancer
