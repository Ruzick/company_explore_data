Pay is low for the amount of responsibility. Your quarterly evaluation is destroyed due to unrealistic goals (management acknowledges that the goals are impossible to achieve, but wont change them). That then use said goals to show that you are not worthy of advancement. Any higher positions that may become available are filled with preselected (yes men). This is a highly physical job so you will be sore having to stand all day on concrete floors. Sitting down for a few minutes is strictly forbidden so there are lots of foot injuries with employees . Beware, HR will lie to your face about what the job is to get you in the door. 3 of the last 4 people they manage to hire quit during there second week because the job was not what they were told it would be.

If you want to make changes to a process, you have to know even the basics of that process. You can't keep people because of the awful work environment, and that's not going to improve unless you care even a little bit.

As a leader, I have come to notice that you don't get paid for what you do, but what Step up cards you are signed off on; leading to at least a years worth of initiative-driven work with a hourly rate of <20 dollars. The Higher Ups will push and push for success and through wrenches into the plan the whole way there. HR takes years to respond to anything and when they do, they are clinical and free of any human touch. On top of this, Management (anyone Band 1 and up) will rename their positions so they do not/won't revolve back to the manufacturing lines.

Advice to Management
Listen to your people, REALLY listen to them, stop making decisions that effect others lives without allowing those effected to give their input, change the schedule if you want to to get back to hiring high quality individuals versus scraping the bottom of the barrel like you have been and PAY ACCORDING TO THE JOB TITLE. There's no reason that employees are doing the work of what would be nearly a 6 figure salary job at entry level pay. Communicate with your people what's going on versus just making the change and not letting anyone know why. We've literally had people go from one schedule and job title one day to having their entire position and schedule change the next and not even be told about it. There is no plan and it's obvious, so get some level headed people in there to make the real calls and get some structure together. You can't use the fact that it's a start up plant for everything. Some decisions are just blatantly careless and is killing all morale in the site.

","The culture is absolutely horrific and no one wants to put the actual effort into improving it. They say they do, but never want to actually do what they need to do to make it happen. Typical of the corporate world, a lot of backstabbing goes on. Transparency is something they tout, but do not appreciate or follow. If you call someone out on a PVP violation, they find ways to ding your performance and push you out. Sometimes FMLA requests are gifted with letters from your boss threatening to fire you because you're not there. Science backgrounds are underappreciated and also no longer welcome in the company. Promotions are slow for most and are not given because of performance, but rather how your boss sells you, or how much you suck up. You could have a great career for years, have multiple bosses that have praised you the entire time and give no complaints about you, and then get one person/boss that doesn't like you and your career is screwed- and it doesn't matter if you have been there 5 or 25 years. The people are encouraged to be this way since the company still uses a rating system for performance, which has long been counterproductive. It is only meant to be used as a temporary weed out system but it has been at least 25 years that this system has been in place and is truly no longer effective. Diversity of the mind is also not appreciated, if you don't think like the majority, then they treat you like you're stupid. There is a glass ceiling, and for some levels, you will never be able to grow your career because they will stifle and block you from doing it.

","They make you ""part time"" but work you full time, force you to be on-call 24/7, and don't give you benefits. As a part time employee, I was working 50 hours a week in January, 40-some hours a week in February, 50 hours a week in March and then they made me take April off instead of promoting me to full time employment. 

Management is sexist and will always make sure a man in charge of a project. At one point, I was actually told I couldn't do a job because I was a woman.

Pay is good until they ask you to do plumbing and electrical work but won't send you to school to learn the basics. It's only a matter of time before someone dies from their negligence. 

During installs, Senior mechanical warewash specialists can purchase beer and have unlimited amounts for dinner while field specialists spending are swiped with a fine tooth comb. A lot of my tools were purchased with my own money because management would not allow more than a small amount per month. 

Do not work for this division of the company. They have no plans to recruit. They only wish to hire many, many part time employees to avoid giving you benefits.

","terrible and deceptive hiring practices for outside experienced new hires being brought into a&t roles; no advancement opportunities for a&t hires; cult-like group think mentality; culture of blaming; managers move roles too frequently; lack of sound strategy; poor decision making across business functions; careless treatment of admin staff; systems and technology are lagging; can’t keep up with industry disrupters, market share will continue to decline if you don’t hire and retain people with outside experience and resist group think.
Advice to Management
Revamp your hr and hiring practices: people with outside experience hired into a&t tracks are stuck in dead end job, while recent college grads take management roles. This hiring mentality is responsible for the culture of group think which stifles innovation and keeps P&G behind. 

Stop moving managers around every 2 years. Staffing issues caused by constant backfilling and lack of on boarding in new assignments causes lost revenues, missed opportunities and crippling losses to productivity (my desk alone lost millions of dollars due to a 6 month vacancy on a sales team.) 

Stop treating A&T employees like indentured servants. 

Innovate. Get a more functional database for sales teams instead of fooling around with antiquated systems and poorly designed spreadsheets.

","A company that used to strive to both hire and pay in the top 10% now just wants to be ""average"" they still want top performance from employees....... not average, the company is self insured, and still passes increased cost of heath care to the employee - not a problem if you're a manager at their wages, big hitter for techs. Information flow through the ranks only flows down, feedback never gets through the glass ceiling.
Advice to Management
Over the years, we have greatly reduced, lost, a significant amount of independent thinkers based on how our Management is structured, young people starting with the company quickly learn, if they want to move up the ladder they need to ""cow tau"" to their boss. Any reality checks never move up the corporate ladder, thus no good news, you must not be doing your job....... no raise, no promotion. A very high number of Managers only delegate work, because that is what they have been directed to do, and have very limited knowledge of the work their subordinates do, this is a model for disaster and the Company has been going in this direction for some time now. I believe this has a lot to do with the current lack of growth / stagnation of P&G as a whole. We need take care of our Employees at the lower levels, not just Management, quit taking - reducing benefits for Technicians, they ARE the backbone of this Company, I think our founding fathers Procter and Gamble had no intentions of the reward systems we have in place now being so skewed to benefit Management, and not be shared equally across all company employees.

I did gain some skills but I had to dig for them on my own. P&G does offer a ""My Learning"" tool but it's only good if you use the skills once the course is taken.
P&G is changing with the announcement of their reorganization design. I do believe in the change and believe it is good as employees tend to jump around from job and business unit so quick , mastery is never created.
They do give away a lot of free product and to employees and there are panel coupons you can use to buy product. (Tax is taken out of your pay check)
","P&G is not a promote within company. Hard work is not rewarded. Color of your skin and where you were born receives the promotion and the job. If you are a white male, just save your time and go work for another company. Slow company... P&G systems do not talk with each other and the email. Most people old and new are afraid to pick up the phone or have a face to face conversation. P&Ger's fear confrontation. People jump around from job to job so quickly that mastery is never created.

Need to get more agile and push decisions to those closest to the business. Need to accelerate eComm and transform the engagement in this space. Currently it is piecemeal across brands (why there is not better scale leveraged across brands is concerning). 

Too tied to old business processes and ""this is how things are done"" and dramatically change go to market to win throughout customers path to purhcase (which means step change with IOT (internet of things) and the changing path to purchase for todays shoppers (especially millennial and Gen Z). 

KEY CHANGE - start DOING what is said to evolve v. just talking about it and only making baby steps changes. At the pace the company is on, it will be left in the dust before the changes that are talked about making actually are implemented broadly, and it likely will be too late by then to stay competitive. 

Culture has also taken a huge hit in the past 5-10 years. Ask any long time employee, they will tell you that P&G is not the company it was in the past as it relates to caring of their people and overall culture. Many Director Level managers lack inspirational leadership (which years ago was a norm and an expected/required of leaders). This has slowly changed and has been vastly diminished. President and GM scorecards need to better incorporate the ""soft side"" of the business (people/culture deliverable s) to make employees raving fans who work there. When people feel supported, in a positive culture they perform at their best. This is not the case today (and business has suffered) years ago this was not an issue and business was so much better.

Pros
It pays well and there is always a lot of room to get promoted and move up in the company. Chances are that you will get to travel and see a good portion of the United States and the world. The benefits are good and the product giveaways are convenient.
Cons
It is extremely corporate, and there is not a lot of room for individualism or creativity. Problems need to be solved the ""P&G way."" Some of the people are also very stubborn when given advice on how to solve a problem, thinking that their way is always the best way. The hours are very long as well, especially if you work in a plant.

","P&G has lost focus on results. Too much let’s be friends, everyone can be on their cell phone texting etc. and their work comes last. Mr. Procter and Mr. Gamble I am sure are rolling in their graves.
If you are result driven and do not want to hang around the water cooler talking for hours to your co-workers, this company is not for you. If you like to play the game and do not care about true results you will go far in this company.
Everyone gets rated however, most of the people doing the rating are barely out of college and has never been a manager. How can anyone rate another person whom they do not manage nor truly work with??? Too much power is being given to these young, non-experienced adults. 
P&G pays okay however, keep in mind there are many other companies that will pay more for your hard work.
Advice to Management
Focus on results!! P&G used to be an amazing company admired by all. Now P&G is being laughed at and businesses are shaking their heads. 
Create a policy that employees need to leave their phones at their desk, in their locker turned off until breaks or lunch. People hanging on their phones, walking out of a meeting to answer a personal call or phone alerts going off all day is extremely distracting. People are not engaged in meetings anymore because their head is down playing with their cell phone. If people have all this time to play on their phone then consolidate the roles. Get rid of the cell phone players and keep the people whom have results.
Make managers hold people accountable for their work. Managers do not need to be a “friend” they need to be a coach, mentor and hold people accountable when they are not doing their work.
The people that work hard, give results acknowledge them. Stop focusing on grammar, spelling, did not say this politically correct and get back to the real work. If a manager has nothing better to do than focus on this type of stuff, they do not have enough work.

Benefits are great too if you are able to make if in the company long term. If you are lucky to land in a position with a great manager with a clear career path with established timeline expectations, there is POTENTIAL for long term success and career growth.
","In contrast to the Pros, career progression has slowed and career paths blurred. If your management is not straight with you on when and what role you will be working towards, get out. If there is a clear path and role, but then the timeline is missed for when that opportunity is supposed to start, get out. If you request to be transitioned to a new business (for example, R&D to Product Supply), make sure to ask if this will impact your career progression/promotion. If you join P&G in a position that is not where you want to be long term, be clear with your manager on making a clear path and timeline to that next role. Again, if the manager cannot make it happen or timings are missed, get out. P&G is set up to keep employees who are in roles they don't like uncomfortably comfortable the longer you stay, meaning you will dislike your job, but you can't leave because 1) you're tied to P&G because of the benefits, 2) you may be close to vesting, and 3) you can't leave because YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE EXPERIENCE IN A POSITION YOU WANT TO BE IN MAKING IT HARD TO LEAVE AND APPLY TO JOBS YOU TRULY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND START ENTRY LEVEL BECAUSE OF LACK OF EXPERIENCE.

If you can piggy back on the nepotism and favoritism that's rampant in the company, do it (everyone else is). Otherwise expect to wait minimum 15 years to get into a position worthwhile long term.

","Where do I begin. 
Little to no innovation or improvement, due to a culture of same think and a propensity to risk aversion. As an experienced hire it was difficult to utilize background and experience to get any new ideas across to coworkers let alone management. 
Not technically satisfying at all. Felt like an engineer only in title. Material babysitting and supplier manger. I felt that 20 years ago I would have fit in better as more tech and innovation was being done internally. Now is all project management no critical thinking.
Culture of same think was really strong because most employees had little to no work exposure outside P&G. If you don’t fit the same think model it’s hard to get ahead. 
Culture-Most people are there for great benefits and compensation. Everyone felt in it for them selves not the team. 
This was a very disappointing experience for such a large company with a great reputation. Great reputation (same think)
Terrible work life balance. Everyone alway on email and on call.
Lots of management with no real engineering experience making engineering decisions. Lots of travel. 
Culture of me versus not we. The idea of a leader is the loudest one in the room is the alpha... it was a everyone needs to insert themselves in the discussion. Super competitive to the point where you can’t trust peers.

Smart Co-workers, for the most part. Having PG on your resume scores constant calls from recruiters. If you want to make a change you will be able to. If you can come in out of college as a manager then PG is potentially a career company. Conversely, if you do not, you will likely end up leaving for greener pastures.
","PG has been in a downward spiral for years which has left many employees feeling that they have been treated poorly.

Too many levels of management, too many people sitting in meetings all day. This leads to poor execution because there aren't enough rank and file employees to execute half baked strategic plans. Further, Too many are pressured to justify their own existence which leads to ""over scorecarding"" I spent a lot of time chasing the proverbial wild goose on my manager and one up's project du jour. 

Regardless of the Suits constant message that company is profoundly different, the company is no longer growing. This is a problem for you, as an employee, is senior leadership puts the rank and file after shareholders and themselves. Net, you will get a lot more work with no additional pay. I hate to say this, because it will discredit my review but promotions seem to be reserved for folks whom check a box. Cronyism within affinity groups at PG have run rampant.

Advice to Management
Since the (first) Lafley administration, the company shifted its focus from long-term business sustainability to short-term skirmish wins. One significant area where this has been reflected in the slashing of R&D budgets and an (over) emphasis on cost savings just to deliver the next quarter without regard to how the next year or next decade would be affected. This focus shift has resulted in the stagnation of the R&D pipeline, the lifeblood of this great company which once brought the world the first mass market disposable diaper, the first synthetic laundry detergent, and numerous other first-of-their kind products.

Restore the focus of the company to hiring, retaining, and supporting the best employees rather than making Wall Street happy. Your employees (who, by the way, are also shareholders) love the company and will go above an beyond to ensure P&G’s long term success. Day traders (and hedge fund managers) will never care about the long term success of P&G; they’ll only care that they sold at a profit before the ship sinks.

P&G will return to greatness when it rediscovers its identity. When a building is built on a strong foundation, the winds of change can never blow it down.

Fri Nov 03 2017," Associate Director, Finance & Accounting","Cincinnati, OH",Former Employee ,"Associate Director, Finance & Accounting",4,"Great people. Genuine, caring. Strong talent everywhere, and people were always willing to help others. I worked 34 years at P&G. most of my managers were very empowering, trusting me, coaching/training me, allowing me to grow and excel. While the Company surely changed during this period, the culture was consistently one where people treated others with respect and the vast majority strived to always do the right thing.
","Too many layers of management in some areas. At times, inability to move fast, make quick decisions to take advantage of opportunities. At times, things like standardization would be taken too far, not allowing easy solutions for ""off beat"" or unusual items. (e.g. paying an invoice for a new innovation supplier/vendor was a major hurdle/feat with all the bureaucracy and IT hurdles).
Advice to Management
Continue to flatten the organization. Continue to bring in skills ""from the outside"" at the highest levels in the Company. Examples include some of the recent 2017 hires from Coke at VP levels. The pure promote from within policy served the Company well for decades, but with the rate of change in knowledge, technology, systems, etc... P&G simply can't be at its best without harnessing talent outside its walls. As an example, I doubt that the top 25 leaders of P&G have the level of skill and understanding of Snap Chat, Instagram, Facebook, Buzz Feed, etc. that my 18 year old daughter has. P&G needs to have innovative leaders that developed and or led in the growth of these applications or those to come.

Wok/Life balance is a priority in most areas of the company. Provides many opportunities for collaboration amongst teams and across functions. Many opportunities to explore different career paths without having to start over in a new company. Good tuition reimbursement program and other benefits.
","The ""promote from within"" concept only goes so far. If you are hired in as ""non-management"" plan to stay there as promotions out of ""non management"" and into ""management"" are few and far between. Promotion to management typically involves being open to relocating to very little pay increase. 

Pursuing additional education or certifications outside the company will not help with advancement. Company has many over qualified A&T's (non-management) with MBA's that want to get promoted and the company does not provide an open and encouraging path to make that happen that does not require moving. 

The pay scale bands leave many employees capping out after 7-10 years with very few opportunities to see continued salary increases.
Advice to Management
Pay more attention to A&T's. Not everyone wants to stay at the same level for 30 years. If the company wants to ""promote from within"" this should be looked at across all levels not primarily focused on promoting managers. Look to promote employees first before bringing in outside talent. 

Review the pay scale and reward employees who seek additional education or certification. Employees should not be faced with ""capping out"" in their salary range and have to face reviews where no raise is given as cost of living and insurance costs go up.

Stop the ""political"" way of saying things. Be transparent and open, say it how it is. Employees know when they are receiving a line of BS.

I have met some really great people working here, and only a few bad ones. Looks great on a resume. Powerful brands that essentially sell themselves. Company will invest in its people, so long as you can find time to take PG leadership classes into your schedule. After huge layoffs and divestitures, things seem to be normalizing. If you start here right out of college, and come into management, it can be a career company. Conversely, if you don't, you might be in for a challenge. I suppose that's a Pro or Con depending on your circumstances.
","Slow, slow, slow career growth with a pipeline bursting with talent. You may move a bit faster if you're lucky enough to find a mentor who will fight for you, but I wouldn't count on that. If you do things outside of work to grow your skills (grad school, etc) or a highly motivated you will likely outpace the company in terms of keeping up with your market value.

Too much change. There is change for the sake of having change. Leadership needs to pick a direction and stick with it, making incremential changes is OK, but completely revamping design and changing your mind bi-monthly creates a hyper-care environment that drains resources and burns people out...particularly in roles that are already staffed to the bare bones.

Mid to senior level management has a bad tendency of barricading themselves in meetings all day. This has a tendency to keep mid to senior level managers from having to do any actual work...delegation ensues making your heavy desk even heavier.

PG can be very political, becoming more political as you move up.

Expect to be relo'ed to...well.....just about anywhere...including the likes of Box Elder Utah and other desolate areas (if you work in ops). Sales and Marketing seem to get relo'ed to larger markets.

Some employees are like roaches in a nuclear war. They have learned how to buck the system and essential don't do much work, and add very little value. The company needs to do a better job of flushing these employees out.

Has become overly progressive, too much weight placed on employees sex, race, or sexual orientation versus performance. This has lead to some employees in roles that aren't yet ready for.
Advice to Management
I would like to see more of an up or out system. By eliminating life long Band 2's, there will be more room for growth for those who are aggressive and upwardly mobile.

Limit meetings, these are creating millions of dollars in waste. There is NO WAY that a bunch of band 3's, all part of the same organization, have this much to talk about with each other. People are putting meetings on their calendar to make themselves appear to be busier than they are.

Treat all employees equally and leave it at that. Constant emails about diversity and inclusion make it seem like there is a discrimination problem at PG.

Limit meetings, these are creating millions of dollars in waste. There is NO WAY that a bunch of band 3's, all part of the same organization, have this much to talk about with each other. People are putting meetings on their calendar to make themselves appear to be busier than they are.

Treat all employees equally and leave it at that. Constant emails about diversity and inclusion make it seem like there is a discrimination problem at PG.
