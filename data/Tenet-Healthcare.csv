","Has cut employees' health insurance, 401k match, PTO in past two years. Previously, PTO could be carried over to following year, or cashed out by employees, and would be paid out to employees upon separation from the company. The company ended these practices via a surprise Friday night email in 2019. Also, annual PTO was reduced for employees with more than 8 years tenure. In 2020, the 401k match, which was only 3% to begin with, was eliminated. Health plan offerings were reduced to all physician group employees in 2021, and that's likely to be expanded to the rest of the organization in 2022.

Do your research and internet search news stories on this company. They are regularly in court defending (frequently unsuccessfully) significant CMS compliance violations, medical malpractice suits, wrongful employment termination lawsuits and more. Cutting corners and flaunting regulatory requirements are part of the culture here.
Advice to Management
Balance those multimillion dollar bonuses to the CEO with basic health and welfare benefits for your employees. Stop gutting health and welfare benefits to your workforce. Company is supposed to be in the business of caring for patients, so take care of the employees who are providing that care. Healthcare workers are not exactly overpaid. Many of the front line care givers are the lowest paid employees in the company, and the least able to absorb these cuts to basic employment benefits.

","Company doesn’t support the staff. Almost zero lift equipment, assistive technology. Do not adhere to national standards of safety and quality. Poor leadership. The staff are not empowered or encouraged to be involved in shared governance. Honestly, it was shocking after being in 5 other hospitals to come here and feel like I had gone back in time 25 years. This system clearly is either stealing money from their patients and the bedside staff or have no idea how to run a business.
Advice to Management
Create healthy work environments that will retain staff. It isn’t all about number of staff. Invest in equipment and technology that can assist staff in doing their jobs. Get rid of poor leaders and revamp some of the leadership in hospitals that are struggling (Hilton Head). Invest in your employees and nurture talent and grassroots ideas and changes. Implement the LEAN process to create more engaged and efficient processes that will improve the work environment and ultimately generate a positive bottom line. Covid is not an excuse to throw everything out the window and batter the staff to exhaustion when it isn’t necessary. I worked in a system that continued to invest in their employees and work environments actually nurturing them more not less. This has been a very disappointing and eye opening experience. I will never work for a profit hospital again if this is the normal way of operations.

The Access Center/Call Center is trash. 
My manager was flighty and confused about everything. 
I was given a laptop that semi worked and that overheated often. 

They really don’t know what they want you to do and will retaliate in their own way if you countered their offer.

Management managing upwards. Constant changing priorities, being run amok by ex-consultants and cronies of the CEO. If you want to look at a company that cares about employees, look no further than the rating for HCA where their CEO is at74% approval ratings vs a lowly 30%. I wonder why? Read the reviews. They care about their employees and are committed to them. Take Tenet first getting government funds, then furloughing employees only to axe them later to prop up earnings? Who does that and cares about a community built by the employees that actually do the real work? Don't get fooled by a marketing slogan, this company is all about profits and upper management getting ready to (golden) parachute once their contracts are up.

There are so many changes, which change is inevitable, but these changes are made from month to month and it is hard for anyone to be successful. Corporate in Dallas makes decisions based off of “budget,” yet have no clue as to the value of the employees that they are laying off nor the value of their current employees.
Advice to Management
Visit your hospital systems and their ancillary facilities more often to actually see the good that is being done, rather than just focusing on numbers and budgets. It costs more to hire and train a new employee than to retain one. Maybe that will solve some of the budget issues.

Advancement is reserved for those who have worked for McKinsey or HCA. 

They require a distribution of performance ratings at the director level and above that does not permit appropriate rating of the team. You must hit the percentages or they will randomly move people to a lower level of performance. They some how believe this will motivate people to work harder. It is motivating execs to leave.

Tue Feb 04 2020,N/A,"Rock Hill, SC"," in Rock Hill, SC",Continuously cut employee benefits.,0,"Family / Individual healthcare coverage is comparable and competitive with similar companies.
","The PTO policy has changed to a zero hour roll over from year to year. Whereas we used to cap out at 436 hours and could roll over all unused PTO, it is now a use it or lose it benefit which allows for absolutely no cushion of safety for employees who like to keep enough hours saved in case of major illnesses or injury. Generous PTO with a fair cap used to be my favorite part about working for Tenet, but that’s gone now.
In my 20 years with the company I have seen the education benefits decimated, 401k employer match cut in half, employee stock purchase programs take hit after hit, healthcare benefits, while comparable to other companies, is not as good as it used to be, and they even took away the small bonus of a $25 gift card we used to receive around the Holidays. Now they have taken away the PTO rollover and the PTO sell back programs. 
The company only recognizes 5 paid holidays each year, however you must work the holiday in order to receive 8 hours holiday pay, even when working a 12 hour shift. 

At 20 years with the company I am capped out on my pay, and no longer receive raises. Now they are cutting my benefits. It feels like they’re pushing their long term employees away.

Wed Oct 09 2019, Manager,,Former Employee ,Disconnected Team in Dallas Needs Reality Check,4,"Excellent health insurance coverage
Definitely learned a-lot
","It's my opinion that the corporate team in Dallas is pretty disconnected to the realities of the inside of a hospital. When unpopular decisions are made at the corporate level that affect the operations of the local hospital, its the local folks who are put in the line of fire having to defend those decisions ... and the corporate people are nowhere to be found to provide support. On the contrary, any request for corporate support is seen as ""not being able to hold your own"" or ""not being strong in difficult situations."" 

Also, during my time there, high powered & highly compensated executives in Dallas made ludicrous ""strategic"" decisions that were not at all going to accomplish what they set out to accomplish. I kept waiting for someone to jump out and tell us we had been punked or something. But Ashton Kutcher never showed up.

Thu Sep 12 2019, Healthcare Professional,"San Antonio, TX",Former Employee ,Hostile and petty. Power driven management and HR.,7,"None that I can think of.
","Things have changed since Tenet Healthcare took over. They are simply a cut throat company which cares nothing about their employees or patient care. Management in this hospital is a joke. They will keep telling you flattering words but in the end your head will end up on the stick. Double standard is strong and present in this hospital. Those who care have to kill themselves to get the jobs done while the rest would do the bare minimum or nothing at all. All they have to do is kissing up to their bosses. The culture in this hospital is to shut your mouth. People are rude and nosy and are a bunch of back stabbers and they will abuse you whenever they can. And if you stand up to those abusers, you will be told that you were reacting badly and HR will be reviewing you. Bottom line, you need to shut your mouth and let those abusers enjoy abusing you or they will turn around and play victims and HR will listen to them but not you. Unethical practices from employees will be swept under the rug, and this is across the whole system not just at downtown facility. Ironically, those follow the rules usually won't get the same tolerance level and instead will be pushed to work harder to cover for those don't do their parts. So being unethical actually is more rewarding.

They treat their employees as if they own us outright. These HR people all act like they are royalty and noble. Not a surprised since these people are not originally from Baptist but got sent here by Tenet. Totally different mind set and attitude. Since Tenet took over, almost all our best employees had left, either for better paid jobs somewhere or simply because they hated how they were treated. We all easily got a new job somewhere else quickly, got paid better, treated better and some of us advanced up the ladder faster. And they no longer offer sick days. You will have to use your vacation time if bad luck strikes and you are too sick to work.

For off shift employees, they would be the ones who got the worst. Their work load is double, triple vs day shift. They would be told to come in on their days off and would be scolded if they have a reaction. And they have to stay late in the morning to attend those stupid forum meetings where employees are asked for their donations to united way. I'm all for helping the community but just because the bosses now decide that they will no longer want to get in at 6 to conduct 1 session for off shift employees, now the whole crew will suffer. Speaking about leadership. We want to go home after giving shift reports, not listening about charity. And no, the 6pm session doesn't help either because night shifters come in at 10pm.

Baptist has become a nightmare and Tenet is running it to the ground. Their mentality is they don't need to retain you at all cost because they have that school which produces a bunch of new healthcare workers each year for them. They care nothing about their employees, even cut down on lunch menus. Cost for lunch goes up, options go down. We got like 10 cents for pay raise last year. It's pathetic. To evaluate our performances, they used a list of duties which was generalized by including all the responsibilities from all units. So if you are a nurse and the non nursing departments' performance dropped, you will be punished for it as well. So you kill yourself for a whole year trying to earn a good pay raise and in the end you are punished for someone else's mistakes. And everybody knows the whole hospital is short staffed but we kept hearing about the low productivity. It's easy to sit in your office all day and speculate instead of getting out there and see for yourself. If there are 7-8 patients per nurse, then it's delusional to talk about low productivity.

I worked at Tenet Healthcare full-time for more than a year
Pros
Family atmosphere. Generally fun-loving but very serious when there's work to be done.
Cons
Reshuffling from regional to national marketing structure and a top-down executive change-out left many like me working for people ill-equipped to manage us to our full potential. A common problem not unique to Tenet.
Advice to Management
The costs savings of eliminating the regional layer will never be realized. Micromanaging all the properties from one office is something they are simply not equipped or staffed to do. Adding a high-powered agency helps but they balked at the big-time NY agency advance required to begin work/media buys.

","This company is going down hill very quickly. There is a good ole boy CEO who seems to be missing the point. A lot of new people have been brought in, but they have no idea what is going on. The higher ups do not talk to anyone below a Sr Director. Unfortunately, the director down level are the ones doing the work. Decisions happen, but tools and platforms are not taken into consideration. So what is being asked means hours of work arounds. When the people in charge of the tools tell them that there is a better way to do it, they do not listen. It's their way or the highway. The phrase worker smarter not harder means nothing to many. You bust your butt 7 days a week to stay ahead while higher ups implement items that make no sense. There is no communication from them on WHY these decisions are made.

","Where do I begin? 401k vest 5 years, some Managers are controlling and hr does nothing about it when they are told. I’ve never worked for a company that lays people off at this rate. No communication, they switched to a different parking company with 24hr notice and no announcement only stickers on refrigerators like a gas station. No ERP system, the accounting department used S2K, can you believe it, back in the 90s, not just accounting department every single department used either an application that’s old school or one that’s not compatible with the company needs. No Job training. The new parking company sucks, sometimes it won’t let you in. Old school managers.

","A healthcare corporation that does not give their employee's sick leave just 3 hours PTO each pay period. You literally have to punch a time clock at this job. No flexibility at all.
Your training will consists of you sitting at your cubicle with a binder of ambiguous policy. After that you rely on your co-workers to train you. 
 However each person is doing something different as it pertains to the work. 
 The training the managers give consist of them reading the policy to you. There is no real leadership from the management.

Trust your floor staff, stop dictating and ask for Input. Giving your personnel phone numbers to clients makes them thin you don’t trust the supervisors working directly with patient care.

","Horrible downtown location with crappy parking for people who have less than 15 years of experience or who aren't senior leaders. The parking garage is dangerous and my friends have had their cars vandalized. Not safe. Crappy 401k match. Non-existent stock program and options because the senior leaders have mismanaged things so badly that the stock isn't worth jack. Arrogant, self-serving, egotistical, unethical leaders (mostly those closest to the now-departing CEO) who get away with childish, unprofessional, spoiled behavior while the employees suffer for it. No room for advancement unless you are in the small ""chosen circle"" of people liked by senior leaders. HR leaders brag about owning culture. They should be instead hiding the fact that they are responsible for the most pitiful lack of positive culture. People operate from fear and a desire to backstab to protect themselves. HR will respond to this review saying, ""Call so-and-so to further discuss your concerns."" The person they list to call is part of the same long-term problem, as are many people in HR.. People are sometimes hired on looks instead of capabilities. There is ageism throughout the company. They just slashed regional management, a market CEO and have laid off people, all because the company was bloated and spending money on the wrong things. Very poor leadership, which is now coming home to roost. Public Affairs leadership is the opposite of what it should be - also arrogant, spoiled, tyrannical, tactical, practices favortism. Wouldn't know good public affairs practice if it hit them in the mouth. Public Affairs leadership should be wiped clean along with the other leaders who are going away soon or have already been terminated. The company is being stripped down to get rid of the debt caused by poor management, and being prepared to be sold to hopefully a better company. I feel sorry for people who work there now. There are good people who will suffer because of what senior leaders have brought about. And yet, departing leaders will have the most ridiculously large severance packages, while other rank and file employees can barely get by - and they're the ones caring for patients each day. Something is fishy with this outcome!
Advice to Management
Your failure to lead, and your arrogance and poor employee treatment, has brought you to where you are now. Maybe you'll learn from this miserable time and be better wherever you land next - that is - if you don't retire from all that insane severance pay you're receiving. Consider treating employees like the mature, intelligent people they are. Stop practicing obvious ageism. All people have value in the company. Not just the young 20-somethings that you find attractive. Learn to trust and let other people lead in areas where they are good. Stop micromanaging because...how has that worked out for you so far? Potential employees - get the heck away from this company and go elsewhere. Do your research online and see how bad this company and its leaders have been. It's just starting - get out now, or don't ever go to Tenet in the first place. There are far better places in DFW with real cultures, real good leaders and real careers. Stay away from Tenet.

Really, really surreal to watch directors stab VPs stab other VPs and SVPs. I thought management books just made up these scenarios for teaching purposes. Nope! At Tenet it's live action corporate toxicity 24/7. There was even an entire team of VPs and directors, none of whom received merit promotions -- and most employees on the floor knew these ""leaders"" were promoted only because they threatened to leave. To top if off, Tenet's use of technological solutions is almost non-existent, primarily because the CEO gave away huge contracts to his old college buddies whose companies are shamefully behind the times and overpriced.

They even took away kcups for the kuireig machine except for the executive level floors.

Zero work life balance. You are expected to be available and working around the clock. I have even been told that I need to be constantly connected and checking emails when I am on vacation.

How about actually listening to your employees. Hospitals should be about patient care, not profits. Supposedly hospitals are going to be paid by Medicare at some future date based on patient satisfaction. How happy are patients going to be if they have to wait forever for overwhelmed staff to answer their call light? You take endless employee surveys. Why don't you actually pay attention to them for once.

The location is beautiful but downtown itself is a little inconvenient (although right on 75, 35 and the Tollway) especially for so many of us who have kids in schools up north. However, you can have flexible hours when needed and they provide perks at the location like a free shuttle to anywhere downtown, free parking of course, and a new conference center to bring in caterers for lunchtime. I heard they will also have a doctor on site (like a small urgent care clinic). You can also get to cafes and food courts through the building.

The place is so big and so many people are confused it takes months to learn where to go for anything. Half the company support is outsourced to Dell and no one ever seems to know who does what. I sit by 20 people and maybe 2 are actual Tenet employees. The rest are contractors from various companies. It makes the culture bland, $ centered and depressing. No one has any fun at work because everyone works as if a 2 minutes break will get them fired. 

They pay well...because their health insurance is expensive. I've never worked for a healthcare company with worse insurance. Feeling like I can't protect my loved ones is a cause of great stress. 

They don't offer tuition reimbursement which makes me feel like they aren't interested in employee personal growth, but that could be me.

401K match is 50% up to first 6% but it requires that you be with the company 1000 hours before you qualify.. Basically if you get hired at the wrong time it might be two years before you're eligible for a match.

3. Managment tends to relate to employees personal needs (i.e. child care, sick time, personal days), and seem to make accomodations for a work / life balance. 
4. The company values those who seek further education and seem to promote a learning environment. 
5. Because of the incentives for learning and personal growth, Tenet seems to find room for employees to grow and move up after completion of degree programs or certifications.
","Some of the downsides of working for Tenet Healthcare include the following:
1. As seen in many corporations, Tenet has some administrators or managers that have been around for too long. Sadly, these people add nothing more to the departments than nostalgia of times past. In an effort to maintain competiveness in any given industry, a corporation must be willing to identify problems and implement effective policies and procedures to correct the problem. As such, employees may find recurrent ""fires"" or problems in departments that cannot be put out. This can cause frustration among the staff.
2. While education is valued and reimbursed by Tenet, do not expect management to advise you of newly opened positions. They will not show an employee the way out if it does not suit their interests.
Advice to Management
In light of the afore mentioned issues, I would suggest the following to the administrators of Tenet Healthcare:
1. Remove or reassign ineffective administrators or managers. Information can be obtained by improving or expanding upon the questions given in the annual employee satisfaction survey, or by hiring a consulting firm. I would highly recommend the latter, as internal sources may be biased, providing unreliable or inaccurate data.
2. Create a bulliten board designed especially for those who are seeking further education. Post notes and letters on this board (which can be either physical or web-based) informing employees of new positions or helpful hints that can lead them to success within the organization.

They lack MORALES, Staff concern, and most of all they reaaly do not value patients, only the $$$ that they represent, as evident of massive benefit and staff cuts, such as OR cleaners, Nurse's with terrible patient ratios.

Managers treat employees with respect and as equals. Unlike most hospitals, this one doesn't work it's employees to death! Insurance and benefits are reasonably priced and overall pretty good especially for prenatal services.
","The patient volume isn't always really high so sometimes we have to ""flex"" which means we may not work a day or we may only work a half day. For me personally, the salary is high enough that I don't really have to worry too much about it but when there are 2-3 days in a week that I'm leaving after only 3-4 hours it does sometimes make me a little nervous but so far, it has not impacted me in a negative way. Also, the insurance has a deductible which I'm not used to and don't particularly like so I use my spouse's as a secondary. The PTO could be better, its only about 4.93 hours every 2 weeks.
