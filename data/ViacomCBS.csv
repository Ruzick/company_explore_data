Incredible people who look out for one another and help when they are needed. My coworkers always had my back and made me feel appreciated despite terrible treatment from
Execs.
Company has great benefits
","ViacomCBS has tainted my view on the industry as a whole. I received zero training at the start of my employment. I’ve endured bullying and mental abuse from sr. Level executives. I was taken advantage of due to my junior level position and little experience in the industry. I’ve been yelled at, made to complete demeaning tasks, and had false accusations made against me. Several complaints to HR have fallen on deaf ears. Execs are allowed to get a way with treating their staff horribly. Being an assistant on my team, there was little opportunity for growth. Execs did not care to help me grow and I was often provided work with little to no context making it difficult to succeed. I experienced daily micro aggressions from my execs. Because of this, I faced anxiety that I am now seeking professional help with. Execs expect you to be accessible around the clock. I was expected to respond to emails and slacks within 1 minute. If I took any longer , my whereabouts would be questioned.
I faced retaliation from execs after going to HR. Execs began micro managing me and sent emails for every thing they felt was not done right. It became evident a case was being built against me even though I’ve been there for over a year with little to no issues regarding my work. 
I was over worked and undervalued. Supporting multiple execs while receiving lower compensation compared to someone only supporting one.
 Rarely received constructive feedback. My execs were eager to let me know what I was doing wrong and not doing right.
Execs care more about their reputation than the well being of their team. They expect their team to go above and beyond without providing proper compensation. Execs can get a way with performing at a sub par level while their team handles majority of the work.
Advice to Management
Management should hold everyone accountable for their actions regardless of their title. 

Make staff feel like they are valuable (I.e better compensation) and take their complaints and concerns seriously

Conclusion: This has been the worst job of my life and I’m glad I got out. I do not recommend this company to anyone.

","- Wages are at or below market average; raises are seemingly based on your awareness of this and complaints.
- 401K match (60% on 5% of salary) and stock bonuses (2.5% of salary; vests over 3yrs) are merely average.
- Advancement is based on corp needs, social circles, and risk of you quitting, not just performance.
- Promotions often require you to do the work (sometimes for years) before getting the title and pay.
- Office politics often dictate business decisions; too much competition, sniping, and situational manipulation.
- Generally outdated technology and limited ability to cross-train outside of your narrow roles/assignments.
- Employee feedback largely ignored; promises (ex: continued training or assignment changes) inconsistently honored. 
- High level of employee turnover; yearly reorgs; frequent threat of layoffs due to corporate decline.
- Emphasis on hiring entry-level, sometimes underqualified employees who cost less and will 'go with the flow.'
- Diversity hiring quotas trump qualifications; diversity events (ex: women's finger painting) supercede work duties.
- Mandatory nights/weekends, for weeks at a time and without compensation, enforced for some events/projects.
- Decreasing amount of personal space and privacy in various offices / business units (open office concepts).
Advice to Management
Improve the quality, consistency, and transparency of management. An employee's experience depends largely on the person's manager and immediate coworkers. That experience varies widely at this company and can change often due to both employee retention issues and corporate reorganizations. Having managers that hire quality candidates, actively build team cohesion, set realistic expectations, and treat/reward employees fairly is paramount. Improving that would go a long way toward increasing employee satisfaction and corporate success.

","You will never have real job security at this company. That is the sad reality when you work for a failing media conglomerate like ViacomCBS.

There have been layoffs literally every month since the merger was finalized in December 2019 (and tons of other rounds of layoffs prior to that over the years). Most of us want to work at a company where we can grow and build a career and this is impossible for most people at ViacomCBS. If you're a legacy CBS employee you are a second class citizen. This company does everything possible to make it clear that this merger was really an acquisition and that CBS employees are a bunch of dead weight to be cut every time dollars need to be saved. ""Integration"" means installing legacy Viacom executives and staff into 90% of roles and firing most of their CBS counterparts (or making their working situations so miserable that they leave on their own).

Morale is among the lowest I've ever seen in my life at any company. This company is completely tone deaf and has no transparency. It has taken a real toll on employees.

This company also notoriously hires permalancers for YEARS without making them permanent employees. These are people who do the same work as employees but who receive no benefits, no vacation pay and subpar compensation. Oh yeah they'll dangle that carrot and make all kinds of promises but it's all a lie. And even if you are hired as a permanent employee, if you aren't accepted by the ""in crowd"" day one, you will be ostracized and pushed out.

CEO and management are narcissistic and completely out of touch with reality.
Advice to Management
Maybe this so-called leader could have followed the example of other CEOs by foregoing or taking a percentage cut of his hyper inflated salary rather than throwing people out during a pandemic, a time where finding a new job will be nearly impossible for the foreseeable future. Its almost as if top level management wants to run this company into the ground while running out the door with as much cash as they can grab.

Also maybe when you're conducting mass layoffs over the phone, at least try to pick competent HR people to handle it who are capable of answering simple questions and identifying basic shapes and colors.

Fri Feb 14 2020, Design,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,How many art directors does it take to change a lightbulb?,6,"The benefits are good and the pay is not terrible. There are a lot of fun and interesting people to work with and the projects I worked on were enjoyable. The work hours weren't bad either. When you leave after a few years, (which I recommend,) having the Viacom brands on your resume will impress future employers. If you're newer to the industry, it's a great place to learn and gain experience.
","There are soooo many incompetent art directors and vice presidents with fancy titles that don't mean anything useful. My team's general policy for dealing with incompetent directors was to add more layers of incompetent directors to do the original incompetent directors' jobs for them while they took long lunches, left early, and scheduled meetings about meetings in which they complained that there are too many meetings and we should set up another meeting to discuss how we can reduce meetings by adding another director. If you felt my usage of the words meeting and director was redundant: good, you've had the Viacom experience.

I will leave the finer details of my bosses' shenanigans out of this review, but add that such stories have received the frequent response from friends and family, ""How have they not been fired?""

The answer: firing someone requires effort.

Giving someone a raise also requires effort, so don't expect one.

The incompetent directors are also thick as thieves, so if you question any of them, they will defend their dysfunctional hierarchy and outcast you from their high school-style clique, usually by gaslighting you. Don't feel too bad when this happens though, just take it as a sign it's time to take your talents elsewhere.

Stop hiring perma-lancers and make them full time. A wave of talent is wising up and leaving quickly because you don’t value them enough to give them healthcare.

People often in the same position level as you or under you are some of the best people you will ever meet in your life. You will create friendships and camaraderie that will extend beyond your career.
","The conglomerate over-communicates inclusion and diversity, but it really lacks emotional connection with employees and exec management. Execs do a very poor job of building their teams and as a result, business lines are run by people that don't always support their immediate team mates. The company also lacks the thinking of new age strategy in the digital spectrum - even down to the emails, the clock is turned back and you wonder why you have half the tech issues you do. Several support & HR departments are just not helpful, and also have action of non-care. These networks are regarded as 'the best of the best', so in doing so, the people in this company fail to see needs for improvement and take ideas quite often with failure to its given credit.
Advice to Management
Execs - spend more time with your teams, influence your teams to be positive together, hire from within, let go of people that don't embrace or inspire others instead of promoting them and don't be afraid to try new things because honestly, you need to and you need to including all members of your team, and not one one or two.

Management - your role is more than just making your team put slides together to show to your boss and agreeing with what they say - challenge your team to see beyond what is happening now, and embrace new ideas. Understand that your team is there to do more than just print things and prepare for meetings, and stand by your teams more - there is a huge problem with morale across major channels at this company.

Coordinators - Understand why you are there and be supportive and helpful - you are there to contribute, don't have an attitude and don't come in late. You are the demo for most of these brands, so speak up in meetings and try to speak to exec teams so that you can be seen and you can learn - because your teams may not always do it for you. 

Interns - The internship program is really well organized and is a great experience. Work really hard and learn as much as you can - don't be afraid to ask questions, and try hard to follow the direction your teams give you! Speak up if you don't understand!

Also, the company will low ball you, so be prepared to negotiate your salary. If you are a project based employee, keep all your records because the HR wing of project based management works with a third party to process payroll and that team is very burdensome and challenging to work with.

","Where to start? I have been working in corporate America for some time and I can honestly say that I have never seen a place as badly managed nor have I seen directors as heartless as the ones at Viacom. True, the company has been doing horribly so they had to lay people off and close the Franklin TN office, but the way the directors went about it was horrible. This is a place with no future and they will keep temporary hires as temps for well over a year. They will also play it vague when they are asked when they will make the temps go permanent and give some lame excuses. With a purely fear-based management, the only possible way to get promoted is to throw yourself into the Game of Thrones-esc environment and be the best at politics. You must be the best brown-noser to get promoted and talk about what a wonderful Christian you are, although you gossip about your own employees loudly everyday. The word ""Petty"" doesn't even do Viacom justice. In the New York office it is even worse, as they environment there is stiff and cut-throat. And you can forget about getting any recognition, much less a compliment from your supervisor. Morale boosters do not exist at Viacom.

Mon Apr 16 2018, Senior Director,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,"The good, the bad, and the ugly",3,"As with any company, in the right department, there are great friendships and mentors to be found. Schedules are somewhat flexible, office hours are generally 10-6, and unless you're working in corporate there's no formal dress code. Benefits are decent, and you might have the occasional run-in with talent/celebrities.
","With re-orgs and potential mergers happening just about every year, it's hard to feel any sense of job security here at Viacom. And for the most part, all re-orgs have been terribly disorganized with people left wondering who they're reporting to and what's happening for weeks on end. Senior staff operate under a veil of secrecy, and conversations around salaries, raises and promotions can be taboo if not contentious. There's a tendency toward hiring freelancers instead of much-needed staff, and piling more responsibility onto existing staff when employees leave, rather than re-hiring. That said, employees seem to be generally underpaid,e especially if they've remained at the company for a number of years. HR tends to protect the company as opposed to the employees. When a colleague got an outside offer, and went to her supervisor to see if Viacom would counter, she was told ""we don't negotiate with terrorists.""

Tue Feb 06 2018,Anonymous,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,5,"- Began moving in a slightly better direction with Bob in 2016/17
- If you are lucky, you may land a great boss that can further your career and teach you the industry. Some SVPs will constantly promote their reports, but others literally never promoted anyone in the 6 years I worked with their team
","With 6 years under 4 separate teams across Viacom, sadly I saw these across the whole org: 
- Constant re-orgs, layoffs, and people trying to escape. I had 6 different bosses and 15 bosses bosses. My last team was a complete turnstile of escapees at all levels
- Rampant sexism / biases. Two SVPs that I worked with would only hire women and gay men (one even randomly and openly told me while drunk at the holiday party). Another team would only hire Jewish people and told an Arab contractor to leave the country. One SVP told her direct report that she wasn't wearing enough makeup to be promoted
- Runs on politics. Many teams won't work with each other. Bob's helping, but not enough
- Promoting the wrong people. Professionalism and working towards a common goal is useless. What matters most is sucking up to your boss/their boss. One co-worker started as a Director, wouldn't respond to e-mails/meetings/calls to anyone other than his boss or above, and is now an SVP who still follows this strategy
- In 2016/17, levels seemed to be devalued. You'll get 26 year old VPs that aren't professional or making the right decisions, and 30 year old Managers that are go-to's yet stuck per politics
- Digital is still not the focus of the company. Leadership across divisions came from the linear business. When layoffs occur, it's mostly on the digital side. You can present an idea that will double revenue or viewership in Digital, and leadership won't care because it's basically doubling nothing to them
- Viacom is increasingly relying on a Project-Based-Employee workforce. As most of these jobs are actually not project-based, they are illegal. This is bound to catch up with the company just as their unpaid intern program did
Advice to Management
- Management constantly talks about empowering its full workforce rather than just the SVPs and above. Can you actually do something to that effect? It's all talk as we watch the SVPs+ continue to take the spotlight and give no credit

Fri Nov 03 2017,Anonymous,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Manager,0,"- Great work/life balance - great for working moms or for people who have other pursuits outside of their day job. 
- Relaxed atmosphere 
- As long as you have good people on your team, you will have a good experience working here, but that goes for every job. 
- Good medical benefits 
- Good corporate culture. It's a cool place to work even if you're in an area that is not remotely cool. You still get the feeling that you're on the pulse of all things entertainment, which is an exciting thing to be around on a day to day basis.
","- Very corporate. The higher ups have all the power and the folks lower on the totem pole are the worker bees. It helps if you're able to ""play the game"". 
- Depending on your team, it can be very hard to move up. If you're on a larger team, you'll have a better chance of doing that. 
- This company loves to pigeon-hole their people. If you, for example, start in Production Management but are interested in eventually moving into Development, it is very hard to do so and there are limited opportunities to learn about other departments. I have always appreciated how certain companies have a rotation period for young employees so they can get experience in different areas of a given company. This company, on the other hand, does the exact opposite. Once you are in a certain department, chances are you are there to stay. So, my advice to young people is - focus on the department, NOT the network. It's much easier to start at a no-name network in an area you love and later move to a great network than it is to start at the hottest network in an area you aren't interested in. It's unfortunately very tough to make that move internally.
Advice to Management
- Start a rotation program for young people so they are able to feel out different areas and later decide where they are meant to be. Pigeon-holing them hurts everyone: the company and the employees. There are a number of companies that already do this and Viacom needs to jump on the bandwagon.

-Brand has a lot of eyes and resources and will continue to be a priority for Viacom
-Youngish workforce
-Somehow groups like the products group keep convincing clients to spend with us 
-Company paid phone/corp card - pretty standard 
-Working with artists and celebrities
","I had to come back and leave a review after seeing the trades ripping Viacom a new one over the new CEO's creative vision: 

-Impossible to get promoted below Director level unless you live in the politics merry go round with the group VPs 
-Internally mobility is a joke, they have an entire department dedicated to breaking the perception of Viacom as a career dead end where you can't move around; all being a staff employee does is guarantee your app will be read by someone. Hiring managers don't want to inherit disgruntled employees or ruffle feathers of their peers so it seems they disadvantage internal staff members. The brain drain will continue!
-Anti education, growth, self-improvement - colleagues snuck around/lied/hid personal development classes, courses, etc because there's a culture of not wanting ""know it alls"" aka people with tangible skill sets
-This department specifically 
-Sad work place/office that feels like a call center with leadership sitting on their perch in offices
-Culture of micromanaging and hierarchy below Director, you'll be left off important client emails, not invited to company parties/offsites as if you're the group assistant while you lose your mind putting in your all for clients
-Zero training or guidance, you'll be left to figure everything out but then get scolded constantly and micromanaged over minor missteps
-Leadership isn't very bright. Not asking for superstars just people who get the business and think big picture
-HR turns a blind eye to years of exit interview confessions desperately trying to leave a better place for our colleagues since we generate so much revenue
-Boring monotonous work that reacts to clients and trends instead of leading 
-Pay is insulting and raises are impossible, bonuses are tied to how the channel performs which is never going to be healthy again
-Biased interviewing, the things you'll hear about candidates would make HR blush
-Management literally doesn't care if you live or die - sending people up to get their bags during building fires, intimidating people to come in during storms 
-Employee reviews are super harsh and personal and not at all helpful yet you'll never be able to review your manager or get peer evaluated

-Take new business seriously and look beyond our usual suspect clients, there's only so much QSR, retail, projects etc you can take 
-Stop bowing down to sales on every and anything, they're only as bad as you let them be

","Ridiculously long hours. During production, sleeping at the office was not unheard of. Overtime you were never paid for.

On top of that, you actually work way more than 12 hours a day, but mention that to the PM or PC and you'll be out of work. That's the gig. They've been sued for this before, but they just keep doing it because, well, they can.

","The favoritism within my department was just down right WRONG & I noticed it from day one.
The upper management is terrible. They do not have a clue. They give absolutely NO guidance, NO training and expect you to understand everything like you've been there for 5 years. We literally just rotated sitting at one of our co workers desk while they were trying to meet deadlines and get their own work done. This is a terrible way to teach someone - everyone has their own way of doing something so it was all just confusing. God forbid you ask a question or make a mistake they will look at you like your actually stupid. 
One of the VPs who I unfortunately had to deal with was cruel to the people he did not like- he did not care what so ever about anyone else outside of his team & he also made it blatenly obvious if he did not like someone on his team. This guy would literally made fun of people like a six year old and the things he said were actually hurtful & mean.
Good luck... Seriously though good luck trying to get a promotion if you're not liked because you're not part of the inner circle. AND even if you have been there for over two years and are one of the hardest workers they WILL give it to someone else who just graduated out of college only six months into the job. Only because they like their personality better. It's mind boggling. Really, it is. Just so unprofessional. You have to do some real kissing up to do to move up 
The salary is absolutely terrible. Not worth it 
There is no work life balance because the salary is so low you want to stay as late as possible for overtime 
The environment is so negative everyone is just cursing or yelling - not classy. Not a place I was sticking around for that's for sure.

You have the opportunity to attend late night show tapings. It's paid weekly.
","Don't be fooled. In no way is this an internship ""program"": most of the supervisors have no idea how to foster the development of their interns, let alone know where to start. Because there are several networks, the only cohesive environment that exists is within a 20ft radius, and since college relations oversees all internships, they noticeably give a half-hearted effort in trying to monitor them. Other issues arise when people beyond misfit for management are obviously not trained to be supervisors, but then get involved because you are due to report to them. Interns are seen as disposable, desperate college temps and treated as such. No account or desk set-up upon arrival, no training for the work they expect you to do, no concrete end goals, weak communication. Upper-Management is pretty decent, but it proves their painfully unaware that trickle-down tactics don't work, especially when it comes to talent--build from the bottom up. 

If you're looking to put a big name on your resume and have time to spare for an internship you might enjoy, then I wouldn't discourage you from applying to this internship; if you've been in real internship programs before and are looking for a worthwhile, captivating experience in the industry, move on.

Middle management is never held accountable (indeed there are no procedures to review middle management and their effectiveness). So the inclusive and meritorious culture upper management blindly believes they develop is either non existent or exists only in the rare instance where you have a good boss - but it is a company where failing up is rampant and those who rise to the top are those ruthless enough to throw their co-workers under the bus. Fittingly this media company has the appearance of being hip and inclusive, but has a ruthless and dark underbelly which goes unmitigated by the below market pay. In sum.

I've had many awesome coworkers who were so hard working and truly collaborative. I really hope they're doing well now that they've all been laid off.
","Massive layoffs frequently. This last one cut down 9% of the company. In a public relations piece, the CEO pretty heartlessly boasted about how much money he was saving by taking away so many jobs. Meanwhile didn't see a dime cut from his $40,000,000 (FOURTY MILLION) annual salary. Interestingly they also laid of about 40 people making $1+ mil salaries, makes you wonder who they were and how many are still left making that much. 

The reason the company is doing so poorly is because of the lack of innovation caused by politics/bureaucracy: you get promoted because of your connections, not your talents and when you do try to get your ideas out there, there's a million layers of approval above you. That's why the top is still making millions but they're laying off all the little worker bees where all the actual talent is. 

They don't tap the talent that they do have or at least don't incentivize them well. They have an internal program called the Pitch where they allow all the employees to pitch their best idea so that they can steal it for a mere 10k to the winner - even if it's a million dollar idea. The runners up can have their ideas stolen for free. 

There is CERTAINLY discrimination in pay. If you're a man, you might benefit from this. Ladies, look elsewhere. Promotions are disproportionately given to men.

After seeing everyone I worked closely with get sacked and now having to do the job of three people, morale is spectacularly low. On the bright side, some of that bureaucracy has hopefully been trimmed as well.

Sun Mar 20 2016,N/A,"New York, NY","Senior Manager in New York, NY",Human Resource Employee,4,"Viacom's Brand is well known throughout the world. The company has made significant upgrades to office space and also built an exercise center that is subsidized by the organization.
","Where should I begin.....Viacom's senior management is focused on their advancement and financial gain only. One significant example, is the fact that the organization has experienced two significant layoffs and reorgs due to management's claim that financial goals and targets were not achieved. However, the chairman and most senior executives continue to earn millions of dollars in annual salary, base compensation and long term incentive awards, while most employees are awarded a 3% increase on an annual basis. Senior management is truly a old boys club that takes care of their own. One recent example is the appointment of Philippe Dauman as Chairman. In addition, many executives have acted inappropriately and their actions were somehow swept under the rug. One should never complain about any inappropriate actions as it is highly likely that person will be terminated. Programming is quite stale as it is based heavily on reality TV. After all, how much women clawing at each other can one tolerate. As a result of the horrible programming, advertising revenue has decreased significantly, and the stock value has declined drastically. Morale is extremely low across the entire organization and management simply does not seem to care one bit.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the old boy's network and bring in some new talent that can return this amazing company back to the number one slot that it once had. Focus should be placed on revamping the programming model that has become extremely negative.

Wed Mar 30 2016, Helpdesk Analyst,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,HelpDesk,8,"Big name on your resume. If you are a staff member you are good to go lots of perks. Does not apply for contractors or interns.
","-Culture - If you are a contractor they will make 100 per cent sure you know it and remind you every time holidays or company parties come up. Most likely you will not be invited.

-Experience - Not a good place to gain any experience. They look for qualified people but the pay is very low and the chances to be hired are almost zero. Last staff hired IT person was 7 years ago. Good Luck. 

-Troubleshooting: You will receive an average of 50 calls a day on slow days. I've seen people with 100 calls at the end of their 8 hour shift. To summarize it's a call center. You manager will yell at you to keep your calls at a max of 5 minutes so troubleshooting is almost impossible making your work really hard.

-Micromanagement - I think that's one of the worst parts of working at their HelpDesk. Everyone will tell you what to do... The ADM assistant, the supervisor, the senior HelpDesk, the manager, the VP, the SVP, the CIO and etc. I was waiting for the day the janitor would storm in yelling at everybody.

-Users: The users will treat you like any call center very rude people and everything is a rush. Management and Supervisors will likely not help you in difficult situations.

-Work/Life Balance - Forget about it. Long hours shift, holidays and weekends. If you miss one day you do not get paid. If you come in 5 minutes later you get yelled and have to report on your time sheet. If you stay later which will happen often 5, 15, 20 minutes do not put on your time sheet otherwise you will be called out as extra hours have to be approved by management.

Career Growth: Last IT staff was hired 7 years ago. It's a revolving door job. They only hire contractors and interns. I have seen great professionals with corporate experience, great certifications/qualifications be let go after their contract expire and being good employees. If you have lots of experience I would not recommend but if you have 0 experience of course it can be a good idea.

Thu Dec 17 2015,Anonymous,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Learned a lot...,6,"I learned so much during my 4.5 years at the company and enjoyed and admired many of my co-workers. Working at MTV had great benefits and perks - good employee engagement for a company of their size. 

My manager was one of the best I've ever had. Not the case for everyone across the org, but all Senior Management I worked with were wonderful and really helped me grow. 

It's definitely worth going there for the amount you'll learn - my time at MTV prepared me well for the workforce. I consider it one of my best educations yet!
","Culture is interesting ... the vibe is great - cool offices, lots of access to things, great parities just as you might expect. However, it can be extremely catty. If you're not 'in' with the right people, you can feel like an outsider. Lots of hierarchy, which didn't bother me so much, but did other people. 

I left because of career development and growth. There were opportunities for me to move up there, but not at the speed I was looking to progress. For others, there is very little room for growth and many people got stuck in their jobs for longer than they would at a smaller company - or just not ever promoted. 

I would not consider their comp competative - in some cases, embarrassing. Although it's 'fun' to be there, it seemed many people were under paid and over worked. I'm all for hard work, but the work-life balance was difficult to swallow, particularly with a non-competitive salary.

Pros
Creative environment. Friendly people. Employee perks. Learn on the job. Employee retention.
","The biggest thing - which is widely known and lamented - is that there are no set requirement or guidelines for promotion. Some people get promoted several times in a few years, while others are not promoted or promoted once over several years. (Of course, I'm talking about starting from an assistant or coordinator position). Also, salary is a little less than other entertainment companies.
Advice to Management
Requirements/ Guidelines for promotion should be made as universal as possible so that employees maintain realistic expectations about their potential career growth. Also, it'll cut down on job frustration. Everyone works really hard.

The facility is comfortable enough, as far as a typical Cube Land goes. The only thing free is the coffee, with tea choices.
","The ongoing joke for many years is that it's not a question of if you are going to get let go from the company, it's only a matter of WHEN. 

I spent 13 years at MTV Networks in Nashville in a couple of different departments. I realize the MTV name is what draws many people in the door, but once you're inside, you will encounter some really great people, and some really awful people. Some great professionals, and some just getting by on the coat tails of the professionals. The childish and petty discord is palpable in some departments, and HR has no interest whatsoever in remedying any situation that might help an employee. They will defend bad managers to the death, though. To. The. Death. I've seen more good people forced out because their abusive managers were defended by HR, and there was nowhere else to turn. Even some managers aren't safe either, though. The coupes happen at every level except the top. 

Layoffs are routine; at least once a year, and as many as three, so people are always nervous about their jobs and fearful. There's never any budget money to do your job well. It is to the credit of some incredibly creative people that the network is still operational at all, because they are given so few tools to do so with. 

Just watch Viacom stock on Wall Street. That says it all right there. But the company will lay off 50 low to mid-range employees so that a top executive can keep their 10 million dollar YEARLY bonus. It's shocking.

There's no stratosphere of upper-level execs that are unreachable, everyone is very down to earth and the culture is laid back (or as laid back as it can be for a TV network). I felt like my ideas and suggestions were often taken seriously and in some cases implemented. As a temp first I was hired to the staff eventually and I feel that hard work is rewarded.
","Unless you're an executive, you work holidays. The work can get boring and repetitive, especially with no growth or change in positions. The company is large enough that positions rarely change responsibilities. I interviewed over eight times for different or more challenging positions I felt I was more than competent for and never felt like I was going to be seriously considered. I eventually left the company as a result after seven years.
Having worked at both the 1515 and NOC/Hauppauge locations, I can speak from experience that there is a definitive separation of culture between them. Many, many events and benefits held at 1515 or announced as ""company wide"" only include 1515. The yearly holiday party takes place in Manhattan so Hauppauge employees have to go to the city if they want to attend as well. Any announced training which is free to employees (Adobe Photoshop, Maya, Excel, etc) takes place at 1515 as well.
