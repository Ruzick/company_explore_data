Not the typical inside sales role you would think of. We do make phone calls and send emails sure but the difference is because Cardinal is so large you are selling almost 100% to current customers so the call is much warmer. We sell exciting products that truly make a difference in peoples lives, as well. We demo these products to end users to educate them which hopefully leads to a sale. We also can travel around the country to see our clients if needed which is really enjoyable and every year there is a great sales meeting. 

The pay here is also incredible which almost every single rep at or above 100% of plan.
","With a huge portfolio of products it does take a while to really understand the functions of each and every one to have an educated conversation with the end user who usually is a nurse or clinician. I suggest really doing your homework and taking training very seriously and continuing to brush up quarterly on products. 

With the territories usually being in the multi millions a small sale isn’t going to impact your number significantly.

- Emphasis on Diversity & Inclusion at the upper management/C-Suite level
- Lots of opportunities to represent the company outside of the day-to-day work (e.g. - fundraising, giving back to the community) 
- Work is very much relevant & purposeful being in the healthcare industry
- Growth opportunities through restructuring, acquisitions, and exposure to different business segments within its operations.
","- Turnover. I'd say in my department it was around 60/40 in terms of turnover related to people who left the company and those who took other roles within company.
- Diversity & Inclusion specific to my department was minimal, sometimes felt non-existent. Somewhat contradictory to the message coming from upper management/C-Suite individuals.
- Best way to move up within Cardinal is through taking roles within different departments. If you're below the role of manager, moving up vertically in 1 department can be a challenge and even in doing so doesn't always equate to a change in job responsibilities. It can be beneficial to people who prefer to bounce around to numerous roles in different departments, but not so much for people who like to stay in 1 department for at least 3-5 years and move up vertically. To each their own. Even when you do want to look for a different role within Cardinal sometimes that can be a challenge in finding the right fit for you because of how vast of a company it is. Can be seen as a double-edged sword.

Advice to Management
Make sure to hold VP level leadership accountable for executing company culture within their teams. Employees are asked to take surveys constantly and the buck just stops there . We see nothing after that, other than C-level execs talk about all the things the company is doing - none of which get filtered down to the actual employee level. Hold your VPs accountable to company policies like anti-bullying and harassment. Employees have to use valuable time taking training to learn about company policies, and when it comes down to it, nothing gets enforced.

I worked at Cardinal Health full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
-Overall nice people - this is a good place to work if you are trying to start/build/maintain a family. The job is easy, hours are <40 a week and people never expect you to work weekends. You also will not truly grow as a professional- you will be stagnant. It just depends on what you want in your life.
Cons
-They pick and choose who they want to support. Some people were allowed to work remote yet other people were told they had to leave the company if they tried.

-Job is not challenging at all, you will not grow. When you bring up innovative ideas they will be shut down if they seem even at all complicated. So many projects are started and not finished. There is so much discontinuity - when someone leaves a role, they leave with all the expertise.

-Middle management is questionable - people are always wondering why XYZ is a director or VP. There are some great executive leaders but that’s not who you interact with everyday. Not one time did I have a role where there wasn’t at least one VP or Director who was broadly disliked - one was very sexist, another made inappropriate comments and lacked social cues.

-Lack of diversity. CAH boasts about the awards they have won but they are THAT company that applies for awards and has their employees answer the surveys. It truly doesn’t have that much diversity- you’ll realize this after you leave. If you are Asian you have very few people to look up to.

-Marketing roles are actually project management and you focus more on putting out fires due to all of the back orders and recalls.

-Compensation is lower than most in columbus but then again you will work 35-40 hours max

Wed Aug 12 2020, Individualized Care Coordinator,,Former Employee ,Just being honest...This was my experience. Would have never taken it if I had known it was call center position.,0,"The position I was granted is remote so it was great to be able to wake up & work from home. Other team members were accessible through Microsoft Teams to assist with any questions. The benefits were really good & majority of the team are extremely helpful as well.
","Alright, I'm going to share my red flags that I noticed during my employment with the company. First, as I stated in the ""Pro's"" section the position was remote which required a company issued laptop. To put it simple, I started Monday & did not receive my laptop until Wednesday or Thursday. Luckily, I had my own laptop to utilize during that time. Now, before I took the position I specifically asked ""Is this a call center position?"" Maybe I was too blunt & the company felt the need to ""sell"" the position to me at the time but I was told that it was not. To whom ever is reading this, this position has strict script, your calls are graded (all of them), there is a program that monitors the ""activeness"" of your issued laptop, & patients call in all day which in my case my laptop automatically answered every call. I say all of that to say THIS IS A CALL CENTER POSITION. Do not be fooled. You have to follow a schedule on the programs that tracks your activity or status while you work. You cannot be even a minute off or late without notifying your supervisor of what happened (Again, this is a call center). If you do not notify them trust me, they will contact you. I won't get into how the laptop I was issued disconnected from my Wifi (which works perfectly) & constantly disrupted my adherence throwing me into the incorrect status during my schedule call time which negatively affected my scheduled time with the company. After my orientation training I had to wait almost a month & a half (Yes, you read that correctly) to shadow someone in order to actually see what I would be doing. No fault to the employees but what I found during my time there was almost everyone had a different method of the process that the patients needed to take. I learned things I had never known before almost 3 or 4 months after I was trained that did not coincide with anything I was taught before. Be aware, that one complete fail of a call will completely erase the good calls you may have passed on & fail you for the month (Yes, just like you're in high school). All the while this is happening, you ca be reprimanded for any time on your schedule which you did not follow what was assigned even if that was a glitch in the laptop if you do not report it. I could go on but I'll stop there. If you need a position & are looking to simply get into the field then this is the one but do not forget that this is a strict call center position. I won't get into having to bid for time off etc but I hope this sheds some light to someone. Honestly, having that laptop was similar to having a ball & chain attached to my ankle. You can barely walk away from it for 5 minutes without being reprimanded. Yes, you have assigned 15 minute breaks but beware you could get a call right before your break which overlaps & even before lunch but you have to be back for a meeting right after your lunch which cuts that time short. This is just to provide more insight of what could happen.
Advice to Management
I understand it is difficult to assist employees remotely but a little more can be done to make them feel as if they are apart of the actual team. Keep in touch with your employees besides only reaching out to them to micromanage about time. Give assistance to your employees & encourage them to be with the company instead of just keeping up the schedule. It's so much more but I can't think of it at this point. Just do better. Some of you.

HOWEVER, if you report racist comments, sexual harassment, and any other type of extremely inappropriate behavior to HR, THEY WILL FIRE YOU! They will find any small reason to fire you for standing up against racism and creepy white males that make sexual harassment jokes. Injustice anywhere is a threat to injustice everywhere and this is anywhere. Only thing that HR care about is 'closing' the case. Not to mention, your director will act like he has your best interest but will not stand up for you even if you're a valuable employee

As a Production Technician, the office staff will think that you are less than them and give you all the dirty work and expect you to carry them out and say that they are 'offering' over-time hours. You will notice, in order for a smooth and successful day of production, a lot of support from the office staff is required and they will NOT meet those expectations. Normally, there is no one day of smooth day of production and it's mostly because of the lack of support from the office staff and you WILL end up working 13 hour days, often. 

The scheduled hours will say 9:30 - 8, but a month before they fired me for standing up for what's wrong with our society, the schedule has changed temporarily, indefinitely to 11:30-10 and you WILL get out late. A lot. Like I mentioned earlier. There is no work-life balance. 

Lastly, if you are a RECENT SCIENCE GRAD, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME& ENERGY. You are OVERQUALIFIED& WILL BE UNDER-PAID compared to your supposed 'Senior Tech' Co-Workers who is crystal clearly not as qualified as you are.

Mon Jun 15 2020, Nuclear Pharmacy Technician,"Asheville, NC",Former Employee ,The work is good when you're given decent leadership...,0,"Plenty of hours, promote from within, will pay for job related education.
","Asheville Specific - Cardinal Health was my favorite employer ever, for the first 6 or 7 years. When management changed over a few years ago, everything started a downturn. 

The culture went from an eclectic team of individuals, who respected their manager and always gave 110% to make the business succeed and the customer happy, to a good ol' boy's club that fostered distrust of management and each other, placed volatile individuals with issues like alcohol abuse or frequent outbursts of anger at coworkers in positions of supervision, discouraged/ignored complaints about poor conduct from these superiors unless it directly, negatively affected the workday for management, and demonstrated a lack of confidence in their own crew's professionalism and ability to work independently. 

More generally - If you're working in the Nuclear Pharmacy segment, the company tries to structure a dynamic drug production and delivery service like a warehouse or automotive plant; and it doesn't jive. 

With the current HR and Management policies, you can very easily be shafted by higher-ups that pick and choose when to discipline, and meet criticism with vague accusations of not being a team player, with little recourse to corporate.
Advice to Management
Give more credence to workers, when there are constant complaints, from multiple employees, about a specific individual they work with. Report incidents accurately to HR; instead of only blaming subordinates, without mentioning the main antagonist you have set up in a supervisory role. Don't get so caught up in proving your own choices to be correct that you sabotage the morale and effectiveness of the rest of your crew.

About a 15 minute process.

If you want something temporary, go for it. Just do not lose focus and stay.
","I do not know where to start with this place, how it is legal what they do. Please note, that when I speak down on management, I am speaking about the upper management I.E. corporate, operations managers, etc. First off, favoritism, favoritism, favoritism. I think enough has been said on this in other posts. Basically, your raise and growing within depends on who likes you. Also, favorites can not show up to work countless times a year, making your day hell and they get away with it. The moment a good worker that is not a favorite is 5 minutes late, they are down your back. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WORK / LIFE BALANCE. If you are told you work 8 hour shifts, you are there for 10-11 when you are told you work 10 hour shifts, you can be there from 12-14. Here's where it really gets dirty, they force you to work overtime, but if you used PTO that week, you are being forced to work straight time! How that is legal is beyond me, but if you use PTO, get in a car accident, or get sick that week you get no overtime pay. You will be forced to work holidays while the favorites that work in the office enjoy them off with family. I worked in the MN location and the current operations manager there is a complete know it all who thinks he's better than anyone. He does not even take the input from your supervisor, he looks at your numbers and judges you 100% off of that. He just started last year and thinks he knows it all! I spent 7 years of my life there, this is just the beginning. I could write a blog just on this place, go to school and get treated how you deserve to be!

","More red tape and redundant processes than other companies of the same size. Disorganized and poor quality enterprise resources data. One of the lowest paying large companies in the nation. High turn-over (mainly because of the low pay). Employer sponsored insurance is worse than what most large companies offer (this seems to be a common problem in the health care industry).
Advice to Management
Offer competitive salaries. If you want to keep high performers, mid-career annual raises should be at least 6% (which is really just 4% after adjusting for inflation). Average performers should also get annual raises that at least beat inflation, if for no other reason than in recognition of the fact that an additional year of experience is worth something in the labor market. Offer better insurance. Anthem BCBS doesn't even cover annual physicals at the on-site HQ clinic, or the Quest Diagnostics form the company requires to obtain benefits for annual health certification. There are too many layers of redundant management, which contributes to the problem of having too much red tape. Empower staff to improve processes and beware a tendency for entrenched directors and VPs to mire improvements in corporate bureaucracy.

Average performers should also get annual raises that at least beat inflation, if for no other reason than in recognition of the fact that an additional year of experience is worth something in the labor market. Offer better insurance. Anthem BCBS doesn't even cover annual physicals at the on-site HQ clinic, or the Quest Diagnostics form the company requires to obtain benefits for annual health certification. There are too many layers of redundant management, which contributes to the problem of having too much red tape. Empower staff to improve processes and beware a tendency for entrenched directors and VPs to mire improvements in corporate bureaucracy.

•They selectively fire people without adequate cause, as they don't treat employees the same. So person B is fired for the same action that person A just gets written up for.
•They don't allow factory employees to have candy, gum, cellphones etc., but the Salaried (office) employees walk around the factory talking and texting and don't adhere to the PPE policies that they enforce on the factory workers. They sit in their offices listening to music and eating candy.

I expressed that during the interview as valid concern and apparently that concern cost me the job. Don't Waste your time if you're a single parent, because all they care about is attendance. They rather you show up to work half dead than to dare miss a day. Very dissapointing Cardinal health.

Upper management is doing a great job with coming up with new ideas for a better workplace, but is failing to execute that change within the organization. This prevents the younger workforce from joining the organization, and if they do happen to join, they will quickly leave once they find the true culture to be lacking what was promised in interviews.

Find talent within the organization before moving onto an external candidate. Allowing external candidates to leapfrog willing, hardworking individuals that are already in the organization encourages turnover of current employees.

Pros
If you’re looking for a great opportunity to get some healthcare experience and working solid clients, this place is great for that. They had the best team that I had a pleasure to work with and the best in my career. Our team worked with leading edge technology and interacted directly with major clients. The best part is that we did all of this together as a team. Worked hard and succeeded as a whole team.
Cons
The only challenge is that the clients are a bit demanding so that required lots of long work hours. Sometimes deadlines can be a bit unrealistic which can cause a little stress.

","Terrible local culture. Cardinal “corporate” as they call it is located in Dublin, OH and offers a modern workspace with great flexibility options and a wonderful work-life balance. The Twinsburg location values sitting at your desk regardless of whether you’re actually performing. Don’t even think about working from home or taking an afternoon off. PTO must be authorized weeks in advance or it’s unapproved and held against you. Despite being given a laptop, you must sit at your desk in the building to do any work. Unless they ask you to work weekends.

Workspace is crowded and outdated. Desks are tiny and never dusted or wiped down. Some employees are given standing desks but I can’t figure out how to get one approved for the life of me.

Culture is very authoritarian. If you challenge a viewpoint or offer an alternative, prepare to be written up for insubordination.

Expect zero tolerance policies for things like hitting traffic or being sick. 

While Cardinal as a whole has been a great company to work for, steer clear of the Twinsburg office. You’ll regret your decision to work there every day.

Tue Aug 01 2017,Anonymous,"Dublin, OH",Current Employee ,"Politically charged / Ultra focused on ""diversity ",0,"Generous PTO / life balance focus. Interesting benefits include ""College Coach"" service. For those with children of HS age this is worth $3500/yr per child
","Company VP's and above compensated for selecting ""diverse"" candidates regardless of whether they are / are not qualified. Completely focused on forcing reverse discrimination and promoting associates that ""check a box"".

Unbelievably slow to make decisions and afraid to take calculated reasonable business risk for fear of upsetting suppliers / customers. 

For those who prefer decisions by committee and lack of accountability- this is a great environment for you.
Advice to Management
Make wise business decisions based on data and facts , not based on political correctness or what ""feels good"". The lack of accountability to shareholders borders on criminal behavior

","Stay far away from nuclear division at Cardinal operations and Quality. They have internal battle issues at the corporate level so therefore extends down to local level. There is no work life balance and management does not care one bit. Corporate covers up huge issues and blames it on the sites. They tell you one thing and then act a different way. There is little to no advancement opportunities no room for growth. My advice is simply don't do it ! Technicians are not paid very well in comparison to competitors such as PETNET.

I have been working at Cardinal Health full-time for more than a year
Pros
Lots of flexibility to love around the company, lots of great people, benefits, lots of challenging working to want it.
Cons
Typical bureaucracy you'll find in large companies, communication across teams can be challenging, corporate strategy often changes, your experience at the company may depend on your ability to work independently and build connections.
Advice to Management
Try to carve out the vision for your team to give them direction and a clear purpose
