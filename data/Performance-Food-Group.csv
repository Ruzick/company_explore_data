You're not allowed bathroom breaks only on your 30 minute break from the job and you have to choose between bathroom, food, cigarette or talking to your family. I had to leave once to attend to my sick daughter and fiance. The next day I came in the insisted it was a lie just for me to get off early and threatened to fire me if I ever had to leave early again. Weather it's for my family or not. Disgusting way to run a company they view their employees as disposable. They expect you to sacrafice your life for the job but then treat you as subhuman.

In general, people in the office seemed to be fairly friendly and helpful. The company is pretty old-school, but has recently added perks like wellness incentives and dress for your day. The corporate culture is fairly down-to-earth and somewhat informal. This is not the company to come to if you are a disrupter or change-maker, but it's a good fit if you're more laid-back. I'm late career and not overly ambitious, so I liked the less-stressful environment. I also appreciated an initiative they started while I was there to bring in disabled students to work in the office, giving them office experience.
","The company is very siloed,...not much interchange between different departments, even when it would be useful. Hard-driving people or visionaries with innovative ideas don't fit in here. The company loses good people because of its lack of interest in changing or even improving processes in a meaningful way.

","Management is simply a JOKE! A group of women who are out right rude and unprofessional. Management prides themselves on running a “concentration camp” or “sweat shop” like work conditions. The salaries are $10-$15K below market value in Colorado. Management prefers to hire people that are unqualified, but who can say “yes ma’am” to everything. If you have a voice over time you will be silenced. Management tends to hire only people they know or “kids” of friends. Don’t let the “potential” bonus be that dollar dangling in front of your face; 9 out of 10 it’s typically under $1k. The women in management are like a sorority of mean girls and if you don’t fit their mold or you’re smart, educated and want to grow this is DEFINITELY not the company to consider. Run away FAST!!!

3. Absolutely no communication between colleagues who are affected by the same tasks.
4. Stupid staff meetings that claim to be open to suggestions that are really announcements of new rules. Please save us the time and just email your new idiotic plans.

The Union NEVER forgets to take that dues though. The Dues is the money we pay them for existing because thats literally ALL they do. Local 630 is a joke.

It's not uncommon for some to be there up to 18 hours, this is because no one leaves until all routes have been picked so if someone doesn't show for work it pains everyone just about and it's not uncommon for several people not to come in due to not wanting to or quiting.

Fri Jan 01 2016, Delivery Driver,"Denver, CO",Former Employee ,Welcome to a whole new level of back pain,11,"For the most part, I enjoyed my customers and my set route. Other drivers were cool and its one of those experiences in life that you are glad you did a necessary deed for society, but more glad that its over when you quit, lol.
","Firstly, the reason I left first and foremost is how the truck gets loaded. The job is darn hardwork in and of itself by its nature, but a bad loading job about doubles the work. I remember having to off stack many bags of flour, beans, rice, cans whatever just to get product loaded on the bottom, this happens all day long. The difference of a good load to a bad load is major, much more strain on your body and increases route time by at least an hour and a half or more. 

This has been hapening for years and I know why and so does PFG. They rush the warehouse guys and give them a time frame that they should load pallets or they lose their bonus or can get docked pay. So when they are pulling the orders they might see that they were routed in such a way that they put cans for stop 5-6 on the bottom but then come to cans or flour for stop 8 later because their wonky computer and warehouse layout. Now because they are rushed they dont take off the cans for stop 5-6 so they just stack stop 8 on top and later stops on top of that. Now when we as a driver have to take the time and use the precious little energy left to off stack stop 8 and more in very limited space, it doesnt affect PFG one bit because we arent paid hourly like the warehouse guys, so really when drivers complain PFG does not honestly care, because in order for them to really care and make a drivers life better, that means they will have to put money where their mouth is and to pay the selectors more for their extra time to make sure a pallet is stacked right. 

The equipment in general is decent to subpar. They have trucks in their fleet that will need to regen once to twice in a 10 hour day and are very weak. Unless you get a dedicated truck, you will be slip seating and happily expecting a new bag of tricks everyday. Trucks can be downright nasty inside by other drivers.

This warehouse has a high rate of mispulled items and items not on trucks. Compared to the other warehouses for PFG, Denver, CO is at the bottom of the list. Like I said before, if PFG would put their money where their mouth is and make a darn good effort that trucks are loaded properly, there was a chance I might have stuck around. When I was investigating why everyones truck where loaded so poorly, one warehouse guy told me that he had worked in the food industry for 10 years and pFG pushes their selectors to nearly the point of slavery at the pace they want them to pick and stack pallets. So by PFG rushing them then the poor performance falls us on us to take up the slack. 

My back still hurts from this job, Im pretty sure I aged my back many years what it should be now. Doesnt matter the pay if you will be having major back issues later in life, no thanks. All you do is walk around hunched over in the trailer down stacking and digging through pallets instead of just loading and going. A driver at another company told me his truck just off loads itself. I watched as me and helper arrived at the same time as him and he had more cases of product but still beat us because we were looking and digging for our product. 

Also, another thing is PFG in Denver does a lot of mexican places and pizza places. Lots and lots of can, rice, beans and flour to move, 40-50 lbs a piece. In general the loads are very heavy. 400-800+ cases weighing in at 13,000 to 20,000 pounds, thats a darn lot of weight to lift, push, pull, down stack and restack. I moved 20,000 pounds of product a few times by myself and a 14+ hour day and from my head to my toes I ached, just way too much to expect one person to move in a single day, unless your doing roids or something which obviously you cant do any performance enhancing drugs as a CDL driver.

My ultimate feeling is that I was underpaid for the effort I was putting in and the professional license I worked hard to obtain and work even harder to keep and be a clean and safe driver. I think that $18- $19 an hour average is not enough. As a cdl driver you can make $16-20hr just driving. I would say that a fair pay that might have kept me around is in the range of $27-$30 and hour with Overtime over 40 hours. I figure driving pay would be $17 and just strictly non driving helpers usually make $11-$15, so a delivery driver is doing in reality two jobs, but is not paid accordingly.

If I were to recommend anyone to work here, I would say take a deep hard look at the stress of driving maneuvering all day along with the physical toll on the body this will take on you. Its not for everyone that is for sure, it really grinds you down. Im pretty sure with a little creative thinking and cash outlay the physical workload could be really cut down. Other companies have figured it out with shelved trailers or floor stacking with just scoop and go type loads. I wouldnt go back unless it was a dire situation for me or something. But being in Denver, CO there are a ton of driving jobs that pay as well and much better than PFG and you will have energy at the end of the day to actually live life and not just go home and pass out from exhaustion. This review has been some time coming just figured I start 2016 off right and put the past behind me.

You can show up, do 15 minutes of work, and sit around the rest of the day wasting time until it's time to leave. If you ask for work, you are told work will come soon. Then you will go back to your desk and waste more time.
","For those who have self worth and are looking for a true career filled with personal and professional growth, this is definitely not the place for you. As mentioned above, you will do nothing all day. However, certain people will be ""extremely busy"" and work long hours for the glory of working long hours. The culture here is that long hours equal success. Putting in a 10 hour day doing absolutely nothing at your desk is much better than staying a standard 8 hours and doing 4 actual hours of work. Actual work does not matter. Hours are all that matter. This is due to a lack of management competency, as well as everything being done ""the way it's always been done"".

Recommends
Approves of CEO
I worked at Performance Food Group
Pros
The commission structure is great. PFG is in a growth mode and understands that in order to grow, they must show opportunity for sales reps to make a living.
Cons
limited lines, limited buying power, management not willing to take risk associated with growth, Warehouses are located in small/bad locations for distribution.
Advice to Management
If you seek to compete and operate on the level of Sysco and US Food, then management must understand that each OpCo will take losses at first. Purchasing levels must increase.

Tue Sep 21 2010,N/A,"Springfield, MA","District Sales Representative in Springfield, MA",In the Foodservice industry you have to look out for yourself.,6,"Good benefits comparable to other companies of its size. There is an inside rep that helps with overwhelming workload. PFG does provide Above average Marketing tools. You can make some very good money here with alot of hours. An average Rep makes about $60,000/Year. The very good reps make about $80-100,000/year and up. Its very hard work, but can be very rewarding.
","Management not very supportive. Management does not lead and mentor, they criticise and walk away--they are not there as a team member. Higher management hire alot of outside employees for management roles. They hired someone that I used to work with at another company to manage a team. This same manager was hired knowing he was fired for being so abusive to his employees and upseting customers. Reps from that team would constantly tell me he was just as abusive to them, and their customers did not want to see him. All this in just a couple of months at PFG. Needless to say, I lost alot of respect for the company very quickly. I have moved on to another company now and happy. You use your own car with no allowance. PFG does not provide a gas or phone allowance either.
Advice to Management
Hire within. Nobody knows the company and policies better than someone who has been there. Middle management should be riding with someone from their team 3 or 4 times a week to mentor and help with issues they may be facing. Have training seminars for sales staff. There were sales meetings every month, all we saw was food. I know it is a foodservice company, but there needed to be training seminars as well. No matter how long you have been doing this, there should be constant training. Brett Favre gets coached every week, look at his experience.
