Thu Dec 26 2019, Cloud Analyst,"Midland, MI",Former Employee ,"Great for the Current, Questionable Future Outlook",0,"Dow is a staple to start your career at. The Dow Diamond is known everywhere in the world, and it has a great weigh on your resume. The pay is unrivaled in Michigan. Teams are often humble and easy to talk to, and the work life balance is great. Dow is pushing for inclusion, and it is unparrelled to other companies in the midwest. 

IT seems to be in the vision for the future of the company. As a result, there is no shortage of roles at the entry level area. Dow is in need of a lot of developers, IT, and other areas.

Small town Midland is great for those ready to settle. Getting a new role every 4 or so years in IT seems doable. Midland has great schools, low cost of living, and plenty to do for a family. Mt Pleasant and Bay City nearby aren't bad choices either. University choices are nice in Saginaw Valley, and Central Michigan. 

Benefits are decent. 401k match, health coverage, vision and dental, life insurance, etc. Payouts on how the company is doing every April is nice too.
","Upper Management seems to be lost with the core of the company. Talking to anyone director level is a different story about what Dow's impact on the world is. While inclusion is nice, C-Suite needs to focus more on products and innovation. High dividend for stock payout doesn't make sense with a lack of innovation.

Midland for IT is it. Few people get chances to leave Michigan. No opportunity outside of gloomy Michigan for technology. People in the Tri-Cities can be rude. Weather is terrible outside of June-September.

Being young in the company seems to be rough. Management will often tell people eager to rank to wait. Midland is small and doesn't have much of a young scene. However, it is turning around. Lots of talent leaves due to stagnant growth. 

Rotational program employees will make you feel like you're back in high school. Super clicky, dramatic, and unprofessional. Stay out of them if you are a new college graduate. Its like a fraternity or sorority.
Advice to Management
Re-position yourself. Find out what Dow is, and scream it to the world. Back away from the diversity movement until this is figured out.

Create more opportunity for IT outside of Michigan. You are losing a lot of talent staying in low-energy Michigan.

Great experience especially for someone right out of college. Lots of people of all ages to meet. Lots of different accounting/finance groups to rotate through and get experience. Loved the people and miss many of them.
","Company isn't the same as it was years ago and turnover shows that. 5 years ago the business strategy was to ""Diversify and Specialize"", but then management sends us through a disaster merger+spin that cost more than anticipated and turned Dow into a straight up commodities business, exactly what they were working to move away from before.

Now in 2019 cost cuts are everywhere and many benefits taken away like ESOP, employees spun off to DuPont, and a deterioration in culture. 

I made many friends and wanted to stay at Dow long term, but the writing was on the wall after the merger. New CEO is great but can't fix problems made by the previous one.

Tue Jun 25 2019, Associate Research Scientist,,Former Employee ,review for synthetic chemist in Core R&D,4,"For a young-ish PhD in Core R&D, a position in Core R&D's synthesis/catalysis/polymers group (has been called OPO, IMHC, Chem Sci, amongst other things) is an ok job on average, but not great. I will try to briefly summarize the pros and cons. Overall, I am slightly disappointed in Dow's Core R&D; it has potential to be much more than it is, but the potential is lost due to standard corporate America problems. Therefore, it's a great back-up plan (e.g. you can't find anything better):
-excellent starting offer (pay)
-interesting industrial problems to solve 
-Dow has been around a long time, and has systems for everything. They are already established, and so not that much time needs to be wasted if you trust in the system (this is also a con)
-Dow is good about supporting minorities and groups such as LGBTQ
","-Dow epic-ly fails at co-aligning employee performance with employee rewards (pay raises). The people that rise to the top are always those that play the game the best. Technical performance is 'rewarded', but often the spotlight is stolen by someone else. These sorts of thing are common in corporate america; Dow is on the worse end of it.
-Core R&D is not the best place to be right now (recently chopped pretty heavily), and based on trends in the chemical industry, it doesn't look good for the future. The degree to which Dow's businesses value Core R&D varies, but there historically have been complaints.
-Midland sucks. It's a good place to live if you want to raise a family, but other than that there isn't much going on in any regards. 
-although Dow has a good culture in terms of accepting different races/genders/etc..., it has a very narrow personality type. Everyone at Dow is Type A, and Dow employees struggle heavily with doing anything differently than they used to. Dow really struggles with non-conventional solutions and thinking outside of the box.
-High-level management change every year or two really undermines overall group performance.
-mid-level management (e.g. most people's managers) are usually some combination of ineffectual, impotent, or uncaring. On average I've had a new manager every ~10 months, and not a single one really helped my career much. Some were well intentioned, but constrained by 'rules'. Some didn't care. etc...
-When you factor all of these things together, could think that Dow would struggle with talent retention (e.g. keeping high performers versus people who play the game well). This is a well known problem at Dow. It is very common for people to getting industrial training at Dow and then go off to another company where they are more highly valued.
Advice to Management
In the end, Dow is a complicated mix of pros and cons. To be happy at Dow, you'll probably need to have one or multiple of the following things:
-'settle' for a lackluster career, due to having good pay in a low cost of living
-raise a family, since Midland is good for that but not good for much else
-be one of the lucky few that is 'fast tracked' early on in their career (people are secretly selected within a few years)
-or, you might be the personality type that is content with simply doing good science (and not being fully rewarded). In a company full of Type As, there are a handful of Type B's which play an important supporting role.

Since the Olin split I haven't seen leaders really developing the younger engineers and the site 'favorites' don't seem to be holding their people accountable. Mentoring young engineers and techs are one of the most important things in manufacturing. They are your people in the field who are going to run your plants reliably and keep people safe.

Good involvement with volunteer projects ie: Habitat for Humanity, Live United, etc.
","Poor leadership. Young, unexperienced, and unknowledgeable individuals given leadership roles and responsibilities who lack the fundamental skills and tools required. Career driven leadership with their own career development and interests in mind only, not their group whom they accepted responsibility for. Immature leadership can often be found engaging in non work related recreational activities such as ping pong vs attending to their actual role and responsibilities. Or, away from their desk and office, unreachable if needed, attending a social coffee collaboration schmoozing with upper management and leadership.

Poor work - life balance. Available vacation time is not allowed to be used when requested. Or, if approved, vacation time will not be taken due to excessive work loads and unrealistic time requirements.

Absolutely ridiculous work schedules. In the office and lab on time prepared to do my work and per my supervisor (for their own career gain), have to wait for someone else to decide to show up to observe their process or experiment being ran. I shouldn't be held responsible if someone else can't wake up and get themselves out of bed in the morning. This situation, often a repeat and ongoing situation, would result in a 12 hour day turning into a 13 hour plus day allowing for set up, prep, running the process or experiment, and the daily required clean up. 

Unrealistic work loads with unreasonable time requirements while other people sit in their office and play with remote control air planes, legos, or watch youtube videos about pottery and then claim they are far too busy for anything when asked for their assistance with a project. 

Career development and advancement opportunities are only available and extended to those in favor. Surprisingly, excessive drinking is the ""norm"" after hours and is a requirement to attend and participate for advancement opportunity consideration. For all others who don't fall into alignment, you're stuck until you either resign your position or the leadership deletes the need for your role with the company or decides to merge your role into someones in favor to justify the significant raise given.

Dow is really big on safety. Annually, EVERY employee is required to actively participate in the companies drive to safety commitment. Interestingly, each year, safety incidents occur and are swept under the rug or go completely unreported out of fear of RCI (Root Cause Investigation) witch hunts which ultimately become a blame game resulting in someone being responsible and getting fired. 

Disrespectful and inappropriate cafeteria workers with horrible attitudes.

Large corporate company which behaves as such.

","Knocked two stars off overall rating solely due to my experience at Deer Park. 
Almost 10 years after Dow bought out Rohm and Haas, Deer Park is still very far behind in implementing established Dow work processes. The most fundamental work processes are often questioned and/or ignored here. Younger employees or heritage Dow employees have a difficult and frustrating time working with the heritage Rohm and Haas employees. Rohm and Haas had a culture of changing parts to keep units running instead of trying to address root causes. I feel this site in particular is a sinking ship and that Dow may choose to sell or close the plant down in the future. 

There is also an awful lot of gossip and childish behavior at this site. I have worked at several other Dow sites across the USA and have never experienced such pettiness among adults.
Advice to Management
Make sure your employees are properly trained and are implementing Dow processes. Actually do your job and enforce the Dow ways. Allowing for Deer Park to continue operating outside of Dow work processes will only push employees to Freeport.

Mon Jul 09 2018, Production Engineer,"Freeport, TX",Current Employee ,A good company...easy to be caught in a corner,6,"Dow has locations primarily in Louisiana and Texas, but there are a lot of places you can work for Dow. Dow has a lot of variety in the types of positions available. There are some nice opportunities to move up and the plants have a safe culture.
","Businesses that ""make more money"" than others get a lot of extra perks and also get extra resources from other ""seemingly less important"" businesses within the company (which are the ones that make less or no money). If you work for the ""seemingly less important"" businesses, you may find yourself frustrated about a and important instrument that has had a work order in for 6 weeks while your all-star planner and I&E technician have been leveraged out to other ""more important"" plants. Business is business, but the company does even try to hide this divide. 

Also, since the Olin split and the DowDuPont merger, the company culture has grown more focused about cutting all costs, which makes sense. However, when I watched the merger video with all of the big wigs about a month after Hurricane Harvey, they mentioned what we went through for about 30 seconds, then got right into the merger stuff. They dropped it like a rock with blatant disregard. It was bad enough they waited until the last minute to call hurricane duty because of....MONEY. Unfortunately, that event has left me questioning the company's dedication to safety, in spite of how safe we actually are and do practice in the plant. Like I said earlier, business is business, but I feel like a number here.
Advice to Management
Lead with integrity and treat people throughout the company as equals in spite of whether the business they work for makes a larger profit or not. Utilities and environmental services are necessities on chemical sites, but these people do not get much recognition or reward. For example, if the company does not want to buy lunch anymore, that is fine. What is not fine is buying lunch for one business and not another. That makes people feel discouraged and want to leave. We have lost many great operators to other blocks and other companies because where I work is treated poorly compared to other blocks.

","Dow used to proudly display signs in office hallways saying that people were their ""most important asset."" They took those signs down long ago. Just before he was forced to depart the company, the CEO prior to Andrew Liveris gave a speech in Atlanta where he said that his father warned him about working for a big American company, saying that Dow would ""chew you up and spit you out."" That is what Dow does. Dow will pay you enough to string you along, then after years of loyal service, throw you out on your behind.

","Dow Chemical/Kelly Services is no longer a competitive pay position in regards to the material handler. A role from which the machine operators to the logistics team rely heavily on while simultaneously underfunding and overworking the one manned role that takes two persons to succeed. The position operates as a high standard role without the same invested moral and hard work that you put into the business. I saved them $30,000 just on my shift alone for the year by working by myself in this under staffed position. If you add the other understaffed shifts together (1st-5th) that is almost $150,000 they have saved shorting us a man for the year! While the merger between Dow and DuPont bites away at the financial aspect of the business, many contract workers in this position are dragged along the lines of a hopeful future and continue to struggle to show loyalty and dedication. The Dow employees are mostly entitled... I mean an ""empowered"" culture who look down on you, tell you what you can't do in their fear mongering safety culture, all the while commonly reciting, ""its not my job to do this-or-that,"" even if they have training because they know they are protected by their job security no matter their performance or moral standing.

- Good year end bonus and stock purchase plan. 
- Decent health insurance and 401k matching at 4% (if you put in 6%). 
- Good pay compared to the rest of the industry. 
- Good job security: usually people only lose jobs if they happen to be from the company Dow acquires, but for Dow employees it's quite unlikely to get fired. All the people who retired early got offered excellent packages.
","- Very slow pace: good for people ready for retirement, or with lots of kids or family commitments but not good if you want to make things happen. 
- Bureaucracy: as found in all big corporations. 
- Slow career advancement: Take 3-5 years to be promoted to the next level, and there are just so many levels. If you are unlucky, you can be trapped in a middle levels for a loooooooong time. 
- Slow pay progression: since pay is pegged to job level, slow promotion = slow pay increase. 
- Bonus scheme does not reward people who do well: outstanding performers (rated 4 or 5 on the 5-point scale) don't get much higher bonus than poor performers (rated 1 or 2).

Very collegial most of the time. Many opportunities to fix big (albeit unnecessary) missteps--basically a version of the ""fail fast fail often"" mantra, but completely unintentional. Pretty good comp.

Very complex business. Don't underestimate the educational value of joining an old line industrial company. Operations, Engineering, Finance, Legal, Environmental and more are all both broad and complex--far more so than most ""new"" business. Just don't expect great marketing experience: the company mostly sells commodity plastics and chemicals, which is why all the other aspects of the business tend to be used as sources of competitive advantage.
","Despite being amicable, the culture is very rigid and not dynamic at all, especially when it comes to problem solving and strategic positioning. That can be very frustrating since the breadth and depth of the work is so extensive. There are so many missed and mismanaged opportunities!

Majority of executive management is grossly incompetent and owes their position to unquestioning, mindless loyalty to the CEO/Chairman of the Board. CEO is a self absorbed, dishonest megalomaniac who generally ignores his competent leaders out of pride and overconfidence.

Read about his $720k expense account abuse--it's public. Ironically it became public the same week he rolled out a new employee ethics and integrity standard where he lectured the company about, among other things, how use of expense accounts to even the smallest degree is grounds for termination. Also of note, three corporate auditors in a row were fired or quietly force out of the company remarkably soon after each confronted him about his expense account abuse.

","Employees that don't do any work get paid more than those that do. Recognition program is just a popularity contest. You only get 2 holidays off a year, and it's a dice roll as to which two. There are no excused weather days, you must use vacation if it snows 12 inches. Seems kind of strange for a company that is supposedly so focused on safety. I guess they only want you safe while you're there, you must be reckless in order to get there. If you decide to leave the company, and do it the right way, you still have zero chance of getting rehired, it's the policy. If you do leave, they will do everything they can to see that you never get another job anywhere.

Step out on to the floor every once in a while and see who is actually working. Get rid of your no rehire policy. Treat people with respect. While there, I redesigned the end cap of a product, which saved countless rework hours. I was instrumental in helping the engineers reprogram the fiberglass equipment to allow for a new cheaper resin. I solved a tracking issue with one of the machines that even the engineers couldn't figure out for months, which in turn saved the company millions of dollars in downtime and lost material. All I got in return was to be constantly scheduled in the worst parts of the plant, a $100 bonus, and a bad employment reference. I could go on, but I hope by now you get the picture.

-Dow's mechanical integrity program is 20+ years ahead of the major oil company I worked for. I appreciate working in a safe and well-maintained plant compared to the refinery I worked in.
-Training is excellent compared to other companies. Dow will train you on technical skills, leadership, financial acumen; just don't be afraid to ask.
-Work-life balance is decent for plant life. Some weekend call-outs, but that is the industry norm if you work in manufacturing. 
-360 accountability on leadership. You evaluate your leaders just like they evaluate you. As a leader myself, I can vouch that leaders are held accountable for what their employees say about them.
-I/T is good for industry. No, it's not Google or Facebook but compared to the major oil company I worked for it's superior. Documents and procedures are easy to find. The intranet is up-to-date.
","-Like any major corporation, promotions and opportunities can take longer than your expectations. Sit tight, as Dow will come through in the end. You must chart your career path and make sure leadership knows what you want to do.
-Lots of change right now with mergers and acquisitions. In the end it will mean more opportunities but currently there is a lot of fear of the unknown.
-Dow uses the Vitality Curve (rank-and-yank) system all other companies use for Performance Management. It's time to replace this outdated 1980's annual performance review system.

","Glass ceiling for techs within R&D after 13+ years. Bachelor's degree does not go near as far within R&D as it does within M&E (~$10-20K salary difference).

","Within the HR function there is very little room for advancement due to current organizational structure. When a growth opportunity does present itself - candidate is chosen based on who they know vs. overall knowledge, skills and abilities. Overall performance management process is dated; force ranking (leaving many good people at the bottom of the bucket - leading to demotivated employees). Poor leadership within the HR function; what we say we value in leaders is not the type of leader we are putting in our own organization. Understaffed and overworked; continue to say we need to restructure processes to make processes more efficient to ease the burden of our employees - but a) it either doesn't happen or b) it happens but we load them up with additional work and never allow a balance! Behind the market in so many technical aspects.

Access to any imaginable analysis technique or method. Great spirit of collaboration among the R&D community. From a scientific perspective, this is a great company to work for.
","Overloaded with work processes. This company struggles to convert state-of-the-art science and engineering into viable commercial products. Leadership is always looking for extraordinary huge successes, but lacks the ability to predict winners. It is frustrating because few new product research projects ever generate value for the company or society. Senior leadership is obsessed with unrealistic goals and metrics that divert efforts from work that will produce true value.

Also -- be aware that more senior positions will demand your ""life"". The rating system, decreased staffing levels, and unrealistic growth expectations will dominate all of your waking hours and more. Work/Life balance is nonexistent, especially after you receive a few promotions.
Advice to Management
Senior leaders -- admit that you don't really know how to commercialize technology efficiently and successfully. Adjust your management strategy to delegate decisions to lower levels in the company. Be happy with smaller successes. CEO has attention deficit disorder -- flits from one project to another. He always rewrites history so he looks successful, even though his new technology strategies have largely failed (batteries, solar shingles, diesel exhaust filters, etc.). The company was in better shape financially immediately before he assumed the CEO position, compared to any time since then.

Management styles that have taken over in the past few years are not ideal, especially for the younger generation - too much micromanagement, with upper management promising too much to those above them and to Wall Street, without any regard for those below who have to do the work to meet those promises. Also, it is not encouraging when management solicits employee suggestions for job satisfaction improvement, and then subsequently does nothing about the situation year after year.

Strong projected safety emphasis (although often overshadowed by ridiculous compliance requirements)
Very good vacation
Very good health benefits
Fair pay
","From my own perspective, Dow Chemical is a far worse company to work for now than it was not so many years ago and it's not getting better. As at least one other reviewer has stated, there is far too much emphasis on EBITDA and far too little on the fuel that runs the engine - the employees! Is the ""Human Element"" just an empty slogan?

Leaders overcommit personnel to too many projects which yields ""half-baked"" research and missed opportunities for employees to gain in-depth knowledge about the science they're involved with. This all leads to an unnecessary level of stress and low job satisfaction.

Young, inexperienced leaders are making decisions on behalf of their personnel resources without a good understanding of their capabilities and desires. Input from subordinates is often only solicited after the fact.

True personal safety has become overshadowed by a ridiculously convoluted and disjointed compliance program! The number of online training modules is overwhelming and largely ineffective.
Advice to Management
Commit some real resources to your company!!! Hire more technologists to do the actual lab work and DO NOT assign them to too many projects and other duties!

Hire fewer contractors who generally only stay until they find a ""real"" job. Training new ones all the time is a big time sink for the rest of us! Training doesn't come cheap!

Hire seasoned employees to lead your people! Stop putting your valuable, experienced help in the hands of those who have more interest in climbing the corporate ladder than fostering team unity and helping their subordinates succeed!

As for the safety program, wipe the slate clean and start over! Refocus on practical safety that is relevant to the work environment of the individual. One size DOES NOT fit all!

","Training program scattered everywhere. Training modules from 1996. No structure to the training until Dow Deer Park spent million dollars on new structured program 2014. Maybe end of 2013. After firing so many people for not passing LRB...With no fair training program in place. A new hire had no fair chance. There was no an equal opportunity. . Their trainer chasing overtime doesn't have time for you. Plus the trainer will tell you. They do not receive an extra penny to train you.. Now that's scary statement a new hire drowning before swimming..You don't have a chance. The odds are not in your favor the older 20+ veterans stick together. Your word against theirs. Usually management let the veteran operator make choices on who to keep or who to work on to get them back out the door. The sad part we new operators had to work hard to get a career as an operator, 2 years of college for AAS degree or 1 year certificate to even get a chance, 3000 applicants 400 chosen to come take a very difficult test Dow gives. The criteria 150 pass test, 50 chosen to interview. They hire 1-8 operators. Where as older veteran operators were hired if they had an 8th grade education or a 6th grade drop out. they trained them in 2 weeks. It was not a mandatory test, LRB mandatory skill qualification..There were no training programs in place nor policies or procedures in place. I guess that's why some many operators not here to speak today. Working with Dow great yet since taking over Rhom Haas so much negativity from old veteran operators daily.. They talk about Dow being horrible procedure procedure! To much paper work. Yet the snitch on others to secure they're jobs so they can for 2 more years to make it til retirement. I feel there should be a cap on old operators after 15 to 20 years make the mandatory to retire or go to another department. Because most veterans are problems and lazy. Give others a chance to get in 15 to 20 years in peace and not have to work in an hostile environment. .I put the blame on leaders and management..
Advice to Management
Be a manager in which you are paid for. Stop allowing older veterans to make decisions for you, on others work habits, get out the office an be more active with new hires. Stop listening to snitches usually older veteran operators or a new operator just made it through unsafely. . That gets on the tail of the older veterans and becomes a follower in the hands of mess. Managers be fare listen, observe and pay close attention to each individual. You manager up and give a person equal opportunity and stop allowing a new hire to be bullied then say it's a personality conflict. Take charge on being a neutral advocate for new hires. Own up to the fact you know what older veteran operators do to break down new hires. You as managers make your on decisions on an individual. Please that's what you stated your were going to do when you were hired stop dropping the ball. Pay attention to everyone. The crafty older veterans especially.

","Base salary is lower than most competitors in the Northern California area. Little chance for upward movement at the small to medium sized sites. Few employees are fast tracked through management & even fewer to director levels, without a clear explanation of who is chosen.
Advice to Management
Better breakdown of company strategy as well as business strategies. Clear definition of business goals, how the company plans to achieve them & how that affects the average employee along with their role. Outline expectations related to employee development including promotions, job opportunities, management roles, etc.

Advice to Management
Give the distribution operators a chance to move to process operations. Show them loyalty as they showed you loyalty by staying with the company. You give a kid a job out of process technology school because they showed the commitment to finish the school. How about rewarding the distribution operator with that job cause they showed you commitment and loyalty. They could have put dow on the resume and got another job. So wake up!! You spend a lot of money on training this individual the other company that hires them laughs at you for spending all that money on training that individual for them.

Layoffs are used as a threat to keep blue shirts in line. The safety programs tend to focus more on individual workers while larger safety issues are ignored if it costs a lot of money to remedy.

Mon Jan 12 2015, Business Development Leader,"Midland, MI",Former Employee ,Good corporate experience,4,"Dow is a large company, and offers the opportunity of moving between roles and gaining a breadth of experience. They are major part of a keystone industry.
","It is a very large corporation, and it is hard not to feel like a cog in a giant machine. Management and coaching is not encouraged or rewarded, so little opportunity for mentorship and guidance beyond your own wherewithal. Dow is a bit of an old boy's club, and promotions are influenced by who you know and have worked for and how much political capital they have with leadership. 

The industry is old fashioned and lacks an innovative and face paced environment, and this is true through much of the company. 

Dow wants to be an innovative technology leader, but is caught in its hedge between old school commodities for which cost cutting and efficiency are the keys, which are its bread and butter, and advanced technologies further up the value chain. Dow isn't risk tolerant to place the financial bets and invest in a different type of human resource to really transform as a company.
