","No lunch breaks, barely enough time to take a bathroom break, 80 hours of training and you're on your own, metrics rule everything, non-constructive & harsh feedback from fellow employees (especially as a new hire), not enough technicians, front staff usually doesn't like to/doesn't have time to help the understaffed pharmacy.
Advice to Management
Spend a little extra money to have some pharmacist overlap to allow for better service/performance and breaks. Require feedback to be constructive, rather than allowing an employee to say it's a disaster whenever someone works at a certain store...after a mere two shifts.

I have been working at Walgreens Boots Alliance full-time for less than a year
Pros
I love my customers and the loyalty to Walgreen ! I have meet some amazing people at Walgreen and I feel appreciated by them when I can accomplish their needs. I enjoy building lasting relationships and repeat customers.
I also love the global brands and the thought of some day being known as a beauty store. I am very excited about the changes in the beauty department at Walgreen.
Cons
Walgreen isn't ready to be a Boots store like the UK. The customers would never walk into a neighborhood Walgreen thinking about seeing a beauty consultant to service their needs.
This position doesn't allow you to growth. Your not allowed to do any task to keep your day busy or to your team members. The hours working 5 days in a row 


 at 11 am - 7 pm is unrealistic and BORING
Advice to Management
Listen to your BC and realize this position isn't built to be a cookie cutter. Every Walgreen and location is different.

Target is one of the only places to buy a limited selection of Boots cosmetics and skincare products in the US. It allowed for self-management which you rarely find in retail positions unless you are a manager yourself. 
The PNW DM is very knowledgeable and a pleasure to work for. The amount of information regarding all the products can be overwhelming at first but, gets better with time. 
Boots is a great company who put a lot of quality into their products. There is potential to make well over your hourly rate with some great commission for ""bonuses"" when you meet goal.
","Relying on other Target team members to account for customers needs was hard to always establish. The Target team would treat you like their fellow employee and at times made demands for you to help around the store and outside of your assigned section of solely Boots cosmetics. This made things difficult especially since you are ranked on the daily, weekly, and monthly sales of the Boots department within ""your store""
Splitting commission with coworkers when you split a store can be somewhat discouraging.

","No promotion structure in place so get stuck in role with little hope of furthering your career. They don't put enough emphasis on retaining staff so you are offered little to nothing in regards to training and development opportunities. Focus on No 7 so if you work for another brand you are likely to get sidelined/receive very little credit as No 7 gets all the marketing budget and so gets the most sales. They are massively cutting back on in house development and sending most things to third parties to develop so likely to make cuts to technical in the future, I wouldn't be surprised if the in house technical team is entirely got rid of in the coming years.
Advice to Management
Focus on staff development if you want to retain them. Look at promoting from within to senior formulation roles as people get stuck in level with no hope of progression.

- The atmosphere at work is great, it has a good business culture overall and the people you work with is usually very friendly.
- Staff discount on beauty products.
- The people working at the business usually feel passion for what they do or for the brand they work for, which create a good competition environment between each other.
- You can build lots of connections inside, it is a big company.
","- Several approval layers
- You can usually feel the work you do is not recognised, which can be demotivated. Seniors and directors levels usually give more recognition and give more support to the few working on certain projects/brands which are more important to the business, even if you do the same, if not more work than those at those projects to meet the business and your own annual objectives.
-Intense work environment (this can be positive if being recognised by the business).
-Salary is not great and it is definitely below the market average, although the company offers some good benefits and staff discount.
- Not every team at the business has the same atmosphere unfortunately. This is all to do with the managerial style from each of the senior team managers. It could be because of the different work pressure they all have. I have experience both, very good team building atmosphere and on the other hand, the complete opposite to this.

It is obvious to see working day to day on the job. From the outside, its amazing peers and dispensary staff at all levels that keeps most of our local stores afloat. The public may catch on soon.

To make this sound less harsh, I would like to stress that change, which revitalises a workplace and challenges practice in order to improve the proficiency, professionalism, reputation and future-proofing the pharmacy profession is good. However I am put off by the middle management disregard for genuine (i.e. those that walk the talk) work done on the ground by all the hard working dispensing team.

Stop putting pressure on the pharmacy team to perform to your own inflated ideas of what is possible.

You lose staff goodwill by piling on the pressure and pressurised staff make mistakes and cannot possibly provide excellent customer service.

","No career. Or rather, only career if you find somebody really senior that really, really like you. 
Confused management, very few systems and processes, a lot is based on who you know and having the ear of high-ups. Big issues between the London office and the Nottingham one. Many (but not all) people in Notts are in a golden cage - required to do hardly anything, are well paid, but have otherwise no career prospects and they know they are stuck there. This makes many bitter and resentful. The culture is all about smiling, pretending to be kind but actually no desire to do good quality work, or to improve processes and ways of working. Being liked is more important than being good.

TERRIBLE at dealing with HR issues (no respect for workforce when pushing for structural changes, many people end up with impossible jobs. HR won't do anything if you have a complaint. There is such a culture of ""pleasantness"" that if you complain you are the weird one.

My first day consisted of being left on my own in a small office to go through all the legals on the computer. I wasn’t phased by this as I realised pretty quickly the place was short staffed and I’m a big girl I don’t need babysitting. I had high hopes for Tuesday! Went in only to be taken to a room upstairs and told to dispense weekly prescriptions. There was no equipment and I wasn’t shown where anything was. Anyway, I got on and did it. The afternoon was spent in the dispensary downstairs dispensing prescriptions. Stock was left in boxes and not put away so I had to trawl through loads of stock to find the right meds. This took ages! Has Wednesday off. Went in Thursday only to find I was expected to cover the front of the dispensary with 5 minutes training on systems! Not surprisingly I didn’t do well! Back to trawling through boxes and the pharmacist moaning about being behind!!! Never going back. Don’t work for Boots.

Pros
Having a well known company on your CV
Cons
Constantly restructuring
No clear strategy other than trying to achieve double digit growth
Look at the short term financial year - not long term brand equity or ethical business practice
Power only sits with Orenella Barra and Steffano Pessina which means senior leaders are frustrated, paralysed by indecision and miserable - which filters down to the teams 
Culture as a result is full of people who are either passive aggressive - or just aggressive - as this is the only way to survive 
Many people in Nottingham support office have sadly never experienced any other culture and so accept the culture here as normal

","There are multiple functions each trying to achieve the same piece of work and each duplicating work of other functions. The systems are very manual to the point where one finds him or herself running around the whole site with a piece of paper for manual sign off. The hierarchy is strange at best. There are many levels of managers and only 2 levels of workers. WBA doesn't believe in technical management or technical development and the only way to be promoted is to be a team manager and managing people. With many years of experience there is no such thing as ""senior .... "" and a person with 15 years experience in industry will find themselves the same level and the same salary as a person with 1 year of experience. Senior managers often seem unapproachable by ""non manager levels"" and professionals working here are not free to express their opinions or introduce ideas or challenges. The company benefits are appalling and all of them (parking is one of the benefits) occur a ""salary sacrifice"" hence one can find that even over -£100 or more is deducted. per month

","Targets are put in place that are almost impossible at times to meet whilst providing good care for customers. MUR targets are still very much in place and weekly emails from area management wanting explanations of why you have only delivered one MUR per day are common. Performance evaluations of pharmacists take little into account aside from how well you have grown the profitability of your store in terms of items growth, loss, and of course MURs. Forget about being branded a satisfactory or good pharmacist in the company unless you are willing deliver MURs to customers who don't necessarily need or want them. Staffing levels are at times verging on dangerous, it's not uncommon for a moderately busy store to operate for a day with only a pharmacist and a dispenser. All of this is leading pharmacists leave the company, retire, or deregister completely due to unmanageable stress levels. Oh and forget about life outside of work, holidays need to be booked 1 year in advance and most pharmacists work 3 in every 4 weekends.

The staff shop is amazing, there's also a Costa and Starbucks on site. Lots of opportunities to move around the business.
","Salaries are notoriously bad. In 3 years, my salary only increased by £500 and I had 3 different roles across finance and supply chain. The financial rewards aren't good enough. The performance review process is also terrible as they have a system where a percentage of people HAVE to fall into the very bottom section and therefore get no bonus, so you can do your day job amazingly but then not everybody is allowed to score highly so you get pushed down the scale. The only way to get promotions and pay rises is to work twice your contracted hours and stab your colleagues in the back to get noticed.

","There is no job security as every year hours are constantly being reduced and moved around in branches so you don't know which branch you will work in from one month to the next, it is viewed as reasonable to travel upto an extra 30 mins or 10 miles from your usual branch to work in a different one. Everything is target driven which would be fine but if you're not reaching targets you're often told you will be moved or let go because they can find someone who will. Which in my opinion isn't great customer service to keep changing staff as they're not going to get the continuation of care. You're expected to be 100% felixible 7 days a week, so forget about having a home life. You don't feel very valued by the company. Pay scales are still uneven after the merge between boots and alliance, leaving the alliance heritage ACT'S being paid a considerable amount more than the boots heritage ACT'S for performing the same job role.
Advice to Management
I think you should match the pay between the boots heritage ACT'S and the alliance heritage ACT'S. Make your members of staff feel more valued rather than completely replaceable. Offer existing staff more hours rather than taking on new members. Rethink the pay reviews as making everyone jump through hoops counting everything they do to prove they are working whilst they are being paid takes time away from when they could actually be doing more work.

","not just my branch, but Boots in general is unsafe, understaffed, wasteful and badly managed with bad customer service. Employees are expected to cope with an unmanageable work load while being under staffed. This leads to an unsafe working environment, compromised patient safety, unachievable targets (and therefore never any bonuses), awful customer service and a very stressful, messy, dirty working environment. It is a disgrace that the employees aren't provided with the resources they require to be able to do their jobs to the correct standard and are then personally blamed for not performing, especially in a job were concentration, accuracy and patient safety is so important.
Advice to Management
get more staff to improve safety, customer service and working environment. Especially as we are expected to do a million other things besides our actual job. There is so much unnecessary paperwork to do which just adds to the huge amount of waste that Boots as a company produces. We barely have time to serve customers while simultaneously dispensing their medication, putting stock away, ordering and date checking, let alone be responsible for cleaning the shop, back office, toilets and dispensary. It is ridiculous that a company that advertises itself as somewhere customers 'can trust' is so unbelievably unsafe for customers and staff alike. We can't reach our targets because we don't have enough people to physically do it. If we had adequate staff, the money spent on them would pale in comparison to the profit that could be made through better customer service, increased loyalty and just the shear increase of prescriptions that would be possible with more manpower. The Boots name is being ruined because of poor management.

Benefits packages aren't really aligned with other companies of a similar scale, however AB managed to grow in a recession so the cost cutting mindset is at least working.

Very frustrating when you have to interrupt their gossip or have to go and find them so they can deal with a customer enquiry (usually a return/exchange).
GETTING PAID OVERTIME! CANNOT HIGHLIGHT THIS POINT ENOUGH! If you work overtime expect to fight a battle with management to actually get paid it. It takes numerous enquiries, reminders, down right demanding for you to get anywhere in this matter.
