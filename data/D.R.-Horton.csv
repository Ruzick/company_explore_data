","-Onboarding/Training was non-existent. I was basically plopped at a desk on my first day and was expected to work independently with no training.
-Management style is very hands off and not very warm. They make you feel stupid when you ask a question and they explain things in the most complicated way possible. Cliques within management are very obvious, and they were not welcoming.
-Content of the job did not match the description given during the interview. It was very unclear what the position involved. Just seemed like a bunch of random tasks that made no sense.
Advice to Management
Overall, I would recommend placing more importance on training and onboarding new employees. Also the managing style of this department is very hands-off and cliquey, which made me feel very isolated. I would recommend making more of an effort to be more inclusive so that employees can feel like they are a valued member of your operation.

Thu Nov 12 2020, Sales and Marketing,,Former Employee ,Don’t be deceived,5,"- Stable job because of the market right now. 
- Corporate marketing seems cool 
- some great friendships and colleagues
","1. Senior management within divisions need a huge revamp. The culture is toxic, people are petty, and tons of people are leaving & getting fired even though we are having record sales. Execs have no idea what is going on with the people who actually keep the company going, and hire out of touch people. 
2. The company expects loyalty, but is generally not loyal. You’ll find a few people who have been here for decades, but even then, they get let go. 
3. You’re grossly underpaid unless you’re senior level (the disparity is laughable), and they’ve been hiring those positions like mad.
4. Company often assumes a good sales person will be a good marketing manager. So wrong... all the time. The marketing person usually gets blamed. 
5. Highly stressful at times. 
6. HR is NOT there for you, but for the company. Their code of ethics is a joke. They do not “build people too.” They are there to side with the management and executives. They are firing the wrong people. 
7. There’s a lot of politics the longer you’ve been here. Sales is very catty. A lot of management does not invest in others, but only worry about themselves looking good.
Advice to Management
Your HR needs a complete overhaul, sensitivity training, and needs to investigate accusations more carefully, instead of always trying to do damage control. 

Management needs to be more transparent on changes in the company. A lot of news is kept “hush hush.”

Work on your company culture. Get sensitivity training. 

Pay the people who actually run the show, more money! No wonder there’s so much turnover. When people leave, others are expected to absorb the tasks with 0 pay increase or recognition.

Management has made racial comments. “Why do your kind put big rims on their car?” Corporate is no help they are all “buddy buddy”, and grandfather in. Also, management laughed and joke about me being fired two days later in a meeting. I am happy I kept every recording of everything!

Pros
There are lots of opportunities to sell and make quick commissions. They are primarily a spec builder, so lots of standing inventory.
Cons
The local division has a lot of nepotism. I am not sure how the corporate office allows it. Sales wise, the way they push push push you can start to feel like a used car salesmen. “Wheelin’ and dealin’”.

Pros
If you're new to real estate but GREAT at sales, then you can earn a great living. General real estate is not for everyone, so working at DRH can be a great start i the business. The training is decent, you learn about new construction, the sales process, the lending process, and you must be a ppl person. They would have good sales contest and good buyer incentives to make your job a little easier. Great benefits was a plus!
Cons
Unfortunately, most markets are commission only so it can be off to a slow start for some. If you have a support system at home then great but if not then have enough savings for at least 4 months until your pipeline builds up but it will be worth it for most. Work life balance can be challenging due high demand position.

Upper management ensured that we always knew we are a replaceable commodity. They make sure that we are always just a little worried about losing our job.

0 work life balance. You will only succeed in that place if you give up your life. The people that have been there the longest work 60+ hours a week. You are expected to always be available no matter of on call rotation or written expectations.

I worked at D.R. Horton full-time for more than a year
Pros
Their contract system is very easy.
Cons
I cannot speak for the other divisions however CHICAGO if filled now with unethical management. They use bully tactics, fear tactics and micro managing tactics on you. There is also a TON of favoritism here. It's clear which communities are selling and which are not. And all the veterans are the ones in the better areas. Or you have kissed a lot of "" you know what"" .This place is a revolving door. It has been going down hill for a year or two now. Do your research and consider another market ( state, division ) before considering this one. The sales reps are backstabbing liars. As well as management so I would only recommend to my worst enemy. Oh it is also now 100% commission in a volatile market. So GOOD LUCK having food to eat and a roof over your head. You can go months without a sale. Your also competing against your own coworkers. They have the same floorplans in communities very close to each other with price differences of roughly $30k. So not only are you competing with competitor builders, but you are also competing with YOUR OWN COMPANY! Now they also have a ton of dead communities and yet, they are opening new ones still? At first you would think that doesnt make sense. But when you see it from their perspective, they want to find more honey pots to carry the division. All the while not carrying your pocket. Oh and management stays hush hush over your bonuses! There are tactics at play here that are beyond unprofessional. They will pretend they know what they are doing by blasting you with key words. But this division hires the cheapest managers and clearly they are getting what they pay for! If you WANT HORTON to your research and find a division with as little negative reviews as possible. GOOD LUCK!

Pros
D.R. Horton will always have inventory for you to sell. Having the largest home builder in the U.S. behind you give you a lot of confidence that there will always be opportunistic and communities to sell in. They let you sell your own way and are really laid back, and most of the time will work with you to get a deal under contract.
Medical and other company benefits are fantastic. Chances for vacations and other prizes based on sales volume. 
Management in my area seem to care about you and your personal life and will try to accommodate your needs.
Cons
No base pay, not even a draw. If I don't sell, I starve. 
No real training for new agents. Their Jr. program isn't a terrible idea, but the people that ""train"" you don't have your best interest at heart.

","They expect the Sales Representatives to work full time with zero base pay or financial compensation. In the event a sale is not made, you still do not even receive a stipend for your efforts, even though you have been working full time for months. 

They do not tell you how long it takes to actually receive your first pay check. Expect to not be compensated for at least 3 months after you start even if you make a sale. 

You have to pay your own MLS fees. 

You are not allowed to use your PTO unless you find someone to cover your community and work for you. (When you are the lone salesperson in a community, it's impossible)

You do not receive a lunch break and cannot leave the community for any reason.

Wed Dec 19 2018,Anonymous,"Las Vegas, NV",Former Employee ,"Good company, abysmal division",13,"Welcome to the toxic circus known as the Las Vegas Division of D.R. Horton where you're not a employee - you're a minion. Verbal abuse and bullying is encouraged and rewarded. Once stocked with talented loyal people, a change in leadership about six years ago has resulted in long-term, competent employees, amazing salespeople, and department heads aka ‘Hortonites’ being forced out and replaced with lesser-qualified sycophants. Favoritism runs rampant and performance ratings and feedback are rarely objective and results-based, instead they are now somewhat results and more of how much Senior Management takes a shine to you. Those who were forced out were responsible for making this Division the #1 builder, consistently, in Vegas and for almost a 10-year run. A few years later and after the final turnover of employees (almost 100%!!) since the new Senior management arrived, now this Division is middle of the pack, which should be unacceptable considering the financial strength and resources of the parent company. Decisions are made and policies are implemented on a reactionary basis and based on gut feel, ego, and mood and not data. As said, rampant verbal abuse and bullying are encouraged and most everyone has seen temper tantrums and yelling by certain local leadership. Watching fellow employees routinely being set up to fail or be ousted is the norm and has led to a wasteland of a Division with low morale. Pride and passion have been replaced with just picking up a paycheck since we all know we’re just a number to the local leader who is always looking to replace you with someone cheaper. Apparently corporate doesn’t care how management treats people as they remain far too removed to see potential profits left on the table over the years due to silo-style decision-making, a form of leadership that suffocates growth in this day and age.

Quarterly bonuses are a great company-wide policy, but here you will always be 'catching up’ as first quarter goals will be purposely set too lofty to meet and thus the carrot will always be dangling in front of you to ‘make it up’ so that you tolerate the abuse throughout the year. Here is a hint: never expect 100% of your bonus unless you are the select few; you’ll likely hear ‘let’s get ‘em next year.’ Also, a large portion of the bonuses, which were once all objective and metrics-driven, are now discretionary which is a code word for your popularity with Senior Management. Your direct manager will really have no say in the matter and the staff know this, which affects the chain of command; subordinates don’t fully respect their managers if they are ‘in’ and will routinely break rank. If it weren't for the strength of the parent company and the quarterly bonuses most employees would probably seek other opportunities. Leadership here is based on fear rather than respect and behind the scenes of the local home building industry, the leadership is disliked and mocked but tolerated only due to the financial strength of the parent company. Senior management is highly irritable and prone to childish outbursts - it's almost as if one has, over time, never evolved and adapted a more appropriate demeanor in this day and age. This Division was once full of entrepreneurial hustlers who knew their coworkers extremely well to a place where turnover is so frequent combined with the constant shifting of priorities and responsibilities that it is a challenge to even recognize half the fellow employees and communication suffers as a result, encouraging office politics and backstabbing of which this Division was once devoid. How obedient you (publicly) are and how well-liked you are by senior leadership is now more important than talent, results, and ethics and people that are more loyal to local senior management versus the name on the paycheck last longer. In fact, you may be asked (forced) to uncomfortably tread in an ethically grey area from time to time. But hey they have lots of pizza parties to try to try to cover up just how sad it’s become and gold stars are passed around like kindergarten (yes, they pass out stickers to adults which was unnecessary when this Division was once firing on all cylinders.)

It's unfortunate what has happened to this once well-respected Division that was stocked with an abundance of highly talented people. Where landing a job here was a feat unto itself. Sadly, what this management team has consistently failed to realize is that operational excellence is not just driven by work processes and flow charts but rather by passionate, skilled, and happy and loyal employees willing to go the extra mile because the tenure and longevity brought a family feel to the office and people genuinely cared about the welfare of fellow employees. Now people just live in their cubbies haunched over a laptop, silo-style with fear of what might happen if Senior Management finds them not there for five minutes and where gossip at the water cooler thrives under whispered word about which employee is currently on the s-list. On a positive note, the good news is that if you work here at some point you'll be so overworked from wearing so many hats that you'll learn a few things you will ultimately take with you to benefit your next employer.

I’ve heard they recently removed the cancer, but it’s too late - the damage has been done. This Division is a shell of what it once was and there is no doubt in my mind if the Hortonites were left alone to do their thing, rather than being relentlessly bullied to the point of mass exodus, it would still be competing for the top spot even with the Lennar/Cal-Atlantic merger. Now, it’s just a wasteland that will have to overpay for everything - talent, resources, land, subs just to have a chance to climb back to the highly respected, thriving organization it once was.
","See above. Note: ranked the CEO as neutral. While he has done a great job financially on paper, this Division is evidence that more focus needs to be on ensuring treating people fairly. No opinion.

Sun Jul 15 2018, Sales Representative,"Las Vegas, NV",Former Employee ,A SINKING SHIP. UNDER CURRENT MANAGEMENT - LOOK ELSEWHERE!,17,"NONE - This division's best days are behind it. It's basically a ""sweat shop"" of a division now.
","EVERYTHING! Over the last decade working there I was part of a powerhouse division of elite professionals that maintained market dominance of being the #1 Builder in Las Vegas. Sales People were paid very well and company morale was always high.
About 5-ish years ago a new ""senior management"" took control and has managed to run the ship into an iceberg, and now it's sinking fast!
First, tHEy made sure to run out all competent department heads and replace them with crony friends and puppet sales management, who are simply ""yes-people"" and/or completely unqualified for their position - is mentally/emotionally/verbally abusive, and if tHEy don't like you for whatever egomaniacal reason then will do whatever possible to make your work life miserable - hypocrites that will preach one message in the meetings and then behave completely opposite - does everything in power to make sure sales people get paid as little as possible - has structured the commission so that over 1/2 of it is a ""bonus"" that is made virtually impossible to hit, unless you're one of a handful of ""favorites."" They do this by not putting enough product in the ground or moving you around so much you can't get anything going. The ""favorites"" get the good communities or are left alone to make good money, while most other agents top out around $70k/yr... if they're lucky! THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY TELL YOU DURING YOUR INTERVIEW - IT IS ALL LIES AT YOUR INTERVIEW.
The sales management has absolutely no skills or training for tHEiR position and simply resorts to fear tactics, constant write-ups for trivial items, termination threats, etc... all from behind the computer (usually from home) because too lazy and uncompassionate to lead through inspiration, support, or much less by example - will lie directly to your face about anything and everything and enjoys making people feel bad and uncomfortable.
In the past, turnover was maybe 1 or 2 sales people a year because pay was great and morale was high, and it was very difficult to get a job at DR Horton. Now, many senior agents are leaving due to the abusive environment and low pay, and new hires are like a revolving door because there is no training and they have to fend for themselves. 5+ excellent agents are gone just in the last month+, and morale in every department is the lowest I have ever seen.
This division has gone from being the #1 builder in Las Vegas to currently #4 this year from complete and utter incompetence. It will never recover under this management, just like Centex Homes Las Vegas that was previously run into the ground by them as well.
My advice to anyone seeking employment in any department at the Las Vegas division is to simply look elsewhere until these unprofessional people are removed from their positions.
Advice to Management
Their egos are too big to admit fault, and they are incapable of change, so my advice is simple...
Do everyone at the company a favor and relieve yourselves of your positions. You are unprofessional, unqualified, and the employees deserve better than you are capable of being.
You have destroyed a once amazing division, and you're ruining the product and reputation of a great man, D.R. Horton.

Reward based on activity levels, quality of homes at closing and customer satisfaction, employees that seek motivation and recognition start to question why we are doing this. Add some time to schedules, create even-flow. Provide field office space that reflects the image of the Company, (no dedicated professional should be expected to work out of decrepit job shacks). The market has shifted 180 since the downturn, Super,s are now in high demand - “If your not looking after your employees, somebody else will.”
Provide regular career reviews (allowing employees time to prepare), introduce company culture that provides open communication & feedback (good & bad - we really don't know how we are doing?). Introduce team-building activities (at different times to walks & closings so we can actually attend). Vacations should be seen as a necessary means for employees to rejuvenate so they can perform in this demanding environment, provide adequate levels of field support so time can be taken off. Working throughout the holiday season (quarter end) to deliver homes is tough on families, (A $10 gift card for a bonus explains the cost control comment above). Provide winter jackets for field staff. The daily grind has caused a number of quality people to throw in the towel, ask why they quit & implement some changes to retain Superintendents.

Fri Dec 23 2016,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Jumping with Joy to Start 2017 Free from DRH Shackles,10,"- If you can stand to work there - Job Security: DHI is the number one builder in the US for the last 15 years (by volume). They know how to reel in buyers; that's for sure. 
- Most managers are never there, so most of the time I was the only one working in my office. I found this fact to be irritating since many of the people not working were getting paid more than I was and I was always working very hard. 
- decent health insurance first 2 years - apparently after the first two years it is very good. 
- very good benefits package overall (that's how they explain away the low salary) 
- many offices in many states so - again, if you can stand it - you can always relocate or switch divisions within the company
","- did not get sufficient training in either position I held with the company 
- management does not take the time to coach/mentor newer employees 
- was told not to clock my overtime although I am owed a significant amount of money - Division HR and Corporate HR are aware and no one seems to care. 
- pay is much lower than most other builders - especially since I never worked a 40 hour week. I shudder to think what my actual dollar per hour was during my employment. I normally worked (between at office and working from home) 60-70 hours every week for the entirety of my employment. Ouch. 
- No communication between departments!!!! SO FRUSTRATING. makes everything take three times longer than it should. Very frustrating when you spend so much time at work your boyfriend leaves you, you basically forget how to do yoga and your friends forgot your name.
- Completely unrealistic expectations as far as workload
- Completely unfair division of labor within departments 
- My Primary Care Physician actually advised me to quit. That's how bad this job was for me. And I'm a workaholic - always have been. But this place broke me.

If an employee that was once happy, on-time, prepared, and healthy starts deteriorating rapidly and tells you verbatim ""I'm burnt out"" - it's probably wise to encourage that employee to get a better work/life balance and for you - as manager - to reassess/reapportion tasks within your department.

Mon Jul 18 2016, Closing Manager,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Closing Manager=Glorified Data Input + Obscene Micromanagement,16,"The people at DR Horton are an amazing group of individuals who strive each and every day to work in a team-oriented environment. These highly intelligent individuals do not walk into the office each day to execute ""their"" tasks and then clock out for the day. They come into work each day, they efficiently execute their core responsibilities... and even more importantly, they have the drive to look further past their own cubicle or desk, past their own department and take in what the entire team is doing around them. While each department has a set of core responsibilities that they are held accountable for, it is not a strange thing to see individuals from differing departments meeting together in an effort to share their knowledge of their respective departments in order to see if there is any overlap in duties and if a process could be tweaked to equally benefit both departments, as well as the organization as a whole.

These are some of the most able individuals I have ever had the opportunity to work with and I can't express enough how nice it was to be able to seek advice on an issue interdepartmentally.
","While many of the individuals referenced in the above question are working hard (VERY hard) each and every day, their progress is almost always stifled at the point where their ideas are to be presented to management. This is the biggest roadblock to this organization's success. All high-impact decisions are made by a group of 5 people behind closed doors. Those five individuals do not even represent each of the company's departments. So they've got 5 managers in one office every Tuesday that are making decisions that will greatly impact the day-to-day work life for every department within the company, and yet, they have no one in those meetings to provide valuable input from the Closing Department, the Title Company, or the Mortgage Company.

It's a rat race.

They come out of these meetings every Tuesday afternoon with the ""new"" game plan and the ""new"" way of doing things; which presents two problems:

1. We were not a part of the meeting, so there was no one available to let management know what tactics ARE working and what things AREN'T working.
2. The teams are unable to feel a sense of accomplishment because the ""game plan"" changes every week.

The biggest con for this company overall has to do with the fact that two of the top managers in the division left, leaving two of the most important roles within the company vacant. To remedy this problem, a split second decision was made to just push two other individuals into those two extremely important roles even with the understanding that one of the replacements had absolutely no experience in the home building industry whatsoever, and neither of the replacements had the level of managerial experience necessary to take on those two incredibly important roles. I can say that one of them has stepped up and proven themselves as highly capable in their new role... During my time with the company I personally watched this individual flourish right in front of my eyes... he/she is definitely going places.

As for the other individual... I really wish them the best and I hope that the next few months will bring him/her a wealth of newfound knowledge on items such as, Emotional Intelligence, Social Awareness, Loan Program Guidelines and an overall bootcamp in what it means to work with a home builder.
Advice to Management
I can respect the clear lineation between upper management and the day-to-day players that work in the background. I get the theory, as archaic as it is.

My only advice would be to try to shift your company's culture to one of trust, integrity and quality. I was actually recruited by DR Horton from a position with another reputable builder with an understanding that they needed someone with fresh eyes to come in and assess their processes and procedures within a particular department. Thus, I was offered the role of Closing Manager.

Little did I know that everything that had been discussed in the interviews were ""pretty words"" they decided to sprinkle in, words that which they had no intentions whatsoever to act on.

Be honest and upfront with your employees, they are not there to pay the bills. They do not show up to work everyday so that they may be able to pay rent. They come in, work hard, review that work and then go above and beyond... every. single. day.

In essence, they are loyalists who are being cheated out of working for an organization that truly fosters the value of ""team work."" They are in attendance and doing phenomenal work, but their voices are muted by an archaic take on organizational management. 

Have weekly meeting between the managers of EVERY department and get your company on the same page. Working at DR Horton is like getting lost in a comic book written in a foreign language. No one ever knows what page they're on, and the rest aren't even in the right book.

Fix that disconnect before things go south far enough that even a screen full of numbers can't get you back on track for the month... the quarter... the year... your business.

The only thing going for anyone who actually leaves is that the people management are trashing them to, know management is toxic and not to pay any attention. Management will pin people against each other. There is no trust and God forbid you actually make a suggestion or business process that makes sense to the business itself. The only thing this company has going for them is that they can build a nice house. They are definitely not in the market to keep employees, develop them, or give them any entitlement to their job or skills. It is toxic.
Advice to Management
Find new management and get rid of the ""Good ole' boys"" club. It is a waste of resources. Trust the people you hire and hire people with the right skill set. Yes, this means you might have to increase pay. Listen to what people say should be done and be open to it. Quit wasting time and money by pushing crap out. Put some process in your process design and actually produce something with quality.

Pros
This is a heavy Microsoft shop, and they stay on the cusp of Microsoft's software ecosystem. If you can survive the overbearing management, it can provide a great opportunity to grow professionally if you enjoy working with Microsoft products. Salary can be competitive for the Dallas area market.
Cons
Management. This may seem like a cliche that you've read in review after review, but in my nearly 20 years in professional IT, this is the worst management I have ever seen. The management's treatment of employees is repulsive. If you've never worked for a megalomaniac you'll have the opportunity to do so here. You'll feel like you are slipping into that job you worked in High School. 

Turnaround is obscene. If a system administrator has been there for over a year, he is considered ""senior"". I personally witnessed 10 people either be fired or quit within 6 months. Constructive criticism or guidance is not provided, you will simply be walked out. It's imperative that you have a backup plan if you are a major financial provider in your household!

Don't let the recruiter sell you on the position. DFW has a very competitive IT market, and I strongly advise you look elsewhere.

","Very difficult to take a vacation day. No clear direction as a new employee as to how everything works. Had to figure things out by trial and error or ask one of the Realtors in my area. Asking the area manager how to do something was a joke! IF you got a response it was usually very vague without really answering the question. You're told what the monthly goal is when hired but then it would change based on other criteria. No job security and very poor management in our area. It's mandatory to work weekends and family is at the bottom of the list for this company. They should come first in your life and even on your off days. There was a time when just a few hours before an off day we were notified we had to work our off days. Poor communication and poor leadership which leads to very low morale and high turn over.

","Not a ton of support from management. Unorganized corporate office with no real procedures in place. Limited options when it comes to making changes to homes to please prospective buyers. Long hours. Poor training program for Jr. Sales agents. Stressful due to the amount of responsibilities put on the sales people.

","May vary by region or city but they are going about acquiring communities in reverse. They buy the land then set a price for the community based on a profit margin despite what homes in the area are selling for. Lack of creative thoughts or ideas and being profitable is more important than anything. Yet if the model looks bad you'll scramble to fix it and waste money at the last minute. It all comes down to the community you get, if it is priced correctly in a desirable locale you can be sucessful. Otherwise good luck.
Advice to Management
Buy new properties based on the home prices in the area. If your 20k over priced because of land cost and local realtors are telling you that LISTEN! If your top agents are so good put them in struggling communities and reward them if they can turn them around. Don't force new talent into financial holes because management made a bad purchase.
