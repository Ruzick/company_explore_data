Thu Jan 14 2021, Engineer,"Columbus, IN",Current Employee ,"Good intentions but poor execution (If you are just starting your career read on, this will save you pain)",1,"* Good company to start your career in but not a company to stay for the long term (I recommend you leave after 3-4 years). Within those 3-4 years identify someone that is excels at thinking right and know this person might not have a fancy title, rarely title at Cummins means intelligence, the only area where title means something is in Adv. Engineering, here there is an adequate representation of competence and ability. 

* Depending on when the 25th of December and 1st of Jan fall you could get up to 2 weeks off of extra vacation, in that sense is pretty awesome.

* Good maternity/paternity leave.

* You could have good work/life balance but depends on role (don't take firefighting roles such as Current Product Roles or Service Roles for the most part folks here are lowest IQ of the org, major BSer's or are too new to know any better)
","* Status quo company, ok with marginal improvements. Innovation is defined by purchasing other companies or hiring consultants, instead of establishing that mentality from within. The smartest folks that are not listened to end up leaving. 

* Low pay compared to other companies. 

* Intelligent folks are few and far in between. The ones that want to do good work get beating to the point where they become walking zombies', ""empty suits"" waiting to retire, or again get fed up an leave. Intelligent folks exist but is more the exception than the rule, these people are normally in Advanced Engineering groups, in essence Cummins is getting what they pay for.

* Technical competence is rarely rewarded. Depends on how much your manager wants you to do their your job for them and is willing to fight for you. HR is massively incompetent, keep believing that your salary offerings are adequate. 

* Play the politics, know the right people and you'll get ahead (no different than anywhere else). If you are good BS'er this could also work in your favor, perhaps to a larger degree than at a company that rewards competency, this is a short-sighted strategy in the long term and is a cause of the stagnation the company is seeing. 

* Middle managers for the most part are incompetent, very few have good prioritization skills, most lack technical competence and/or don't know how to manage folks. Even if there are good managers in the midst some have so many people under them is beyond absurd. 

* Some Directors have a large inflated sense of self: big egos, lots of talk and little production. The company is ok with mediocrity so their egos will keep inflating, these folks are at the ""Peak of Mount Stupid"" in the Dunning-Kruger curve. 

* This company is a meeting culture, lots of talk not a lot of producing. Most of the meetings that are generated is to educate the people that can't think for themselves, want to steal your ideas and call them their own, or think time is renewable.
Advice to Management
* Instead of hiring volume (too much dead weight) hire quality. Quality costs money. You can hire 1 awesome engineer, that will produce for 10 but cost double. Why wouldn't you do this?

* Instead of talking about innovation allow innovation to flourish. Change the incentive structure so the company begins to innovate. 

* Identify who your best performers are vs. the brown noses, BSer's/talkers. It's easy to discern based on output vs. meetings in calendar and amount of talk. 

* Something tells me management already knows that if they don't get their act moving by retaining talent, acquiring talent, etc... non-incumbent companies will eat them for lunch.

I felt that my managers cared for me both professionally and personally and I felt a good camaraderie with all of my colleagues. The work was challenging and there was often opportunity, pending business situation for technical growth. There are a lot of tools and resources available to help make sure you can do your work to the best of your ability.

Benefits are excellent and in my experience management was often flexible.
","The biggest downside to Cummins is that they have a very harsh cyclical nature of layoffs. Every 4-5 years they go through an extremely large layoff within the company to ""respond to market conditions"". In doing so they lose valuable experienced talent indefinitely so that even when their markets rebound they are stuck trying to regrow their knowledge base while many persons have lost their careers. I was impacted by a company restructure. Despite that I do not regret any of my time at Cummins and I still think that it was a great place to work; however, you cannot work there with any guarantee of making a long career.

The one downside to my general work at Cummins was that there felt like a fairly large gap between myself and leadership. They sent out good communications regularly, but I never felt a strong connection to anyone more than two management levels above me - perhaps this is simply the nature of a large company.
Advice to Management
Analyze your trends in hiring and laying off very carefully to make sure you are really doing the right thing in how you respond to the markets. Consider if you need to hire less to retain growing talent within the company when the markets are harsh. You need to make sure you are diversifying your assets' years of experience.

I loved my job at Cummins and I was good at what I did. In my time there, I made many improvements in the departments I worked, and saved the company millions. I intended to retire from Cummins one day. But during a Reduction in Force (RIF) my position was eliminated. I'm not saying I was the best employee ever, but the improvements and the advancements I made for the company did not save my job, and I know dozens of others who have been or are in the same boat. 

There has got to be a better way than just cutting thousands of dedicated and loyal employees every few years. If you have to reduce your numbers, the decisions need to be made more selectively. Aside from myself, I know a few employees that were absolutely necessary to the respective operations in which they worked. Despite their being, by all accounts, indispensable, they were also cut. Those operations will falter without them, but the people that made the decisions are too high up and too far removed from the actual operation to see the importance of these specific individuals. In the end, not only do we lose a career, but Cummins loses some of it most important assets and nobody wins.

","Pay - any other location besides Columbus - ask why pay is so much higher in this small town when HR talks about national studies to determine pay because the pay is low everywhere else.

Nepotism - people are hired here because family and friends get them hired. This keeps the long-term unemployed in this condition even longer. This is not only encouraged, but set as a standard.

Good ole boy networking - no need to say anything else.

Work - this company runs on a skeleton crew all the time. This means you work your butt off every single day. Sometimes getting no breaks. Granted, staying busy is ideal, but not busy with five different work loads because they squeeze the budget and don't hire. Unrealistic metric expectations. 

High deductible plan - expensive to pay for medical care. 

Avoid unless you're an intern and need the experience. You won't have to go through the layoffs that the other reviews are talking about. Save money if you do.

","The office is pretty... old-fashioned, as much as a place with people from so many different places in the world can be. Dress codes are somewhat stringent (I've been approached about not having my shirt tucked in, and also wearing a tucked in button-down with too many colors).

Being recruited from a career fair can place you in a position that's nothing like the job described in your offer letter. By far the worst thing I've experienced while there.

Mon Sep 09 2019, Director,,Former Employee ,Almost a great job,2,"For some of my time there I worked with great leadership that had a clear vision of what needed to be done in certain areas of science, and how this work would integrate with the business. There was also clarity in terms of expectations of what could be accomplished in this scientific area, and the uses to which these exercises could be put. In general, work with peers, senior direct reports, and more junior colleagues was a pleasure; partly because of the personalities involved, and partly because of general Cummins values which are emphasized at all levels of the company.
","The highest levels of senior leadership exhibited poor communication on general strategy in this area, and they didn't ask the right people for advice on the decisions they were making. This would apply to both staffing decisions, and to the technical details of the work being done. It often appeared that job titles were mismatched to actual skills in an area, and that 20 years at Cummins counted for a lot more than 20 years in a technical field. While technical expertise is no guarantee of success in any organization, building larger bureaucracies will surely discourage innovation and drive in an area that should be working more as a ""start-up"" than as an entrenched part of the business. There was virtually no representation of the scientific knowledge and scientific experience required to do this job at any level of senior management.
Advice to Management
Hire the right people for technical leadership and listen to them. Cummins doesn't need another interminable powerpoint deck documenting processes with a few hypothetical technical examples. Significantly improve your communication both through ad hoc communication to different levels of the org, and through formal all hands meetings. ""Get **** done"" should be the mantra rather than ""give me xx slides on topic yy to show senior leadership"".

","The way things work are quite traditional and structured. In my perspective being here for few years, I can say that Cummins would not be the best place if you want to grow fast and move up the corporate ladder quickly by overachieving your target. HR structure is so rigid thus getting evaluation of your pay based on your added responsibility is always full of hustle. In my case I have been doubling my responsibilities and hitting all my targets but my manager just didn't support in terms of getting salary bump or promotion based on how I have perform. My experience has been mixed but I would not encourage young people that have a strong ambitions to grow and move quickly to work long term in Cummins.
Advice to Management
HR and incentive structure needs quite a-lot of work. If someone has already double their responsibility and has been performing well, you should have adjusted their pay and promotion into a much more structured and clear approach since great people in the company feels under appreciated and not motivated to do their best work due to long duration to get promotion and slow compensation growth. If Cummins wants to be competitive in the job market place they need to step up their process to appreciate great talent and find ways to retain them exampling tech companies as that's what your brand stands for ""innovation and excellence"". You can't achieve that with great people leaving the company every 1-3 years.

","When demand is high, prepare to work 7 days a week (up to 84 hours a week.) When demand is low, prepare to work 40 hours. The demand is somewhat cyclical and, funny enough, follows the election season. Other things to worry about may include contract negotiations and changes to the emissions standards. Contract negotiations are somewhat lop sided. Newer employees are given huge raises while those that have been here for several years often get small or marginal raises (e.g. New Hire gets a raise of $3.75/hr or more while a junior hire with 7+ years might get a $1.25, senior hires basically get $0 and often times gets a benefit abolished.)

Advice to Management

","Company is run through HR. HR does not report through the businesses, but separately up through corporate. Nothing is more important than HR and they can not be questioned. During investigations, people are considered guilty until proven innocent and this is us.ed as a weapon occasionally. 

There is a huge gap between the corporate world and the plants (where the $ is made). Corporate/company leadership does not respect the plants and seems more interested in HR policy than success. Unfortunately, Cummins has the corner of the market on employment in the area and can do what every it wants. 

Continual management/exempt turnover at the plants makes continuous improvement difficult and the same mistakes are repeated over and over.

Shift the firing approval process a bit more to HR. Currently the power appears to lie with local managers.

","In spite of the years since I've worked at this company, I still find myself quite passionate about it - and not in a good way.

This company combines the mindset typical of southern Indiana with the wages typical of southern Indiana and (generally) an inflated sense of self-worth.

There's lots of company politics, and it's easy to hide behind red tape. It's far easier to stay in management's good graces when doing the bare minimum than when trying to do even a little more. If you do more, why isn't everyone else? And if your boss doesn't try to get a comparable amount of work out of others, they'll get in trouble too. It doesn't help that Cummins generally seems to think that employee seniority and ability are proportional, if not one and the same. If some young upstart does better, well, the only possibility is that they are cheating in one way or another. Probably wrecked quality that day, or cut the lifetime of the equipment in half by abusing it.

Paraphrasing the author of ""Exponential Organizations"", if you make waves in an organization then its immune system is likely to attack you. Cummins has a strong immune system. It has many employees who are convinced they are brilliant, and if you're making the life of someone brilliant difficult, then you must be wrong... right? They'll do all they can to marginalize you and get you out of the organization. Perhaps by giving you the responsibility to fix a high-profile problem, and encouraging you to make bold promises, but sabotaging you by ensuring you do not have the authority to go along with that responsibility. Or perhaps by becoming concerned about your flagrant policy violations and ensuring that HR is aware of how damaging they are to morale... regardless of how trivial the transgression might actually be or how many outstanding employees do the same.

There are lots of ""good ol boys"" at Cummins, and HR and management are firmly on their side. Upper-level management seem to be nice people, but they refuse to believe how much difference there is between what they expect to happen and what is actually done by those under them.

Cummins policies often use language that may sound good but makes them broad and very difficult to live up to. Numerous positions have job descriptions that are practically impossible to fulfill without violating one policy or another. Faced with the choice between standing up for what they think is right or sensible, and what will keep them employed, most Cummins employees gave up on standing up for things long ago.

If you look at a Cummins job posting, you'll find you have to read through a fair amount of non-job-related text before you get to the meat of what the job _could_ entail. Expect to have to wade through at least that much nonsense day-to-day. And notice that I said could: the duties are padded with a lot of stuff that probably sounds quite interesting... but the chances of you actually doing much of what's described are very slim. Someone in the department who has seniority will take the easy and interesting parts. You'll get what's left.

I'm half-convinced that the lower levels of management could be replaced by randomly-selected prison inmates, with no negative effects. Not that inmates would make good managers, but that almost all managers who stick around Cummins are exceptionally poor managers. I once witnessed a manager tell some of his team that he knew their kids (who worked in the same facility) and if they didn't work enough overtime their kids would dissappear. Not funny. Even less funny for those whom he'd told about his first four jobs and how he was fired from them. One for lying, one for stealing, and two for picking fights with his boss. Not someone you want to hear joking about violence.

You'd hope this guy was an exception and that all other managers were far better. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to be substantially below average. The team's faith in HR to do the right thing was such that nobody reported his threats.

","Diversity

This company is big on diversity quotas. While I have absolutely nothing against having a diverse workplace, this is not equal opportunity, it’s equal outcome. 

People who know this can take advantage, leading to “untouchable” coworkers who can behave unproductively and unprofessionally with little to no recourse. Their race, gender, and/or sexual orientation can become a weapon. 

Training

A lot of learn as you go, figure it out for yourself type deals. Lacking in standard procedures. 

Execution

I heard the phrase “that’s Cummins” many, many times in my time at the company. And from people all the way up and down the chain of command. If an initiative is delayed 8 months for no apparent reason - that’s Cummins. If a high-profile project is poorly implemented - that’s Cummins. If people are generally behaving apathetic toward their jobs - that’s Cummins. Effective management and effective implementation of initiatives drops off drastically the further you get from corporate HQ and their core business of designing engines.
Advice to Management
I would say “quit cutting corners” but, really, quit being lazy and apathetic. Own your responsibilities. When I finally left, and the weight of that place was lifted, I realized how toxic it was and how apathetic I had become via marination. It’s not good.

- Very helpful people, each one is so nice and always ready to be of assistance
- Global company - presence in over 190 countries 
- Appreciates family time and offers great work - life balance. You are never expected to work beyond 40 hours a week
- Industry leader - beat Tesla in bringing out electric truck
","- Headquartered in Columbus, IN - majority IT workforce in US is in the HQ. Unless you have a good group of friends, sometimes hard to find things to do in Columbus
- Not latest technology - lot of people have been working here since decades and are resistant to new technologies and methodologies (waterfall still the most prevelant methodology)
Advice to Management
- Encourage use of atleast industry standard technology, even if not cutting edge. Especially in IT.
- Standardize recruiting process - lot can be improved in the process. 
- Losing young talent due to lack of IT office presence on West coast. Even one office in either California/ Oregon/ Seattle would drive up innovation.

","1. Hard to grow professionally - It's hard to move-up. You plateau after a certain point. Lot of leaders linger around in the same pay grade for ever since they cannot grow. You will be competing with someone for a job who has 15 years more experience than you. For people with high aspirations, this acts as a roadblock. Moreover, the company hasn't been growing off for a while which makes the situation really bad when it comes to opportunities. Unless, you have a strong network, you cannot grow.

","Low standard of hiring manager and it turns out of abusing the power. 
The supply chain team manager has no actual operation experience on supply chain but full knowledge bases of ""managing people"". 0% support on daily work, 0 recognition to his team, 0 respect of his team's voice, 0% intention of helping team develop the career but feed with empty fantasy. 100% negative feedback all the time to his team, 100% energy contribute on his MBA study while working hours, 100% abuse “sick time"" but argue with team about their real doctor appointments. Top 1 turnover rate among the BU so far, 10 people in 3 years. I am surprise about the company standard of recruitment. Apparently he has serious problem on working attitude and professions which will impact the productivity, however he can still survive in his 6th years and be ready to jump to another position outside.

Entire team is now having high pressure due to no actual support from the manager. Team has to hold huddle meeting without him to make the decision faster and clearer. Each individual motive and help each other as family to solve the problem. No one likes to report to the manager. Totally big failure of the management on that team.

","Cronyism is a big problem and retaliation. And this is done via the means of disregard to individuals issues with managers or employees who are friends of managers and even dept. heads who may be friends of the before mentioned. Also the Ontrack system which is done twice a year is supposed to be objective and based on your performance but in reality it's based on the manager being very subjective and using their opinion or recollection or even their personal issues with you in grading your performance.
Advice to Management
My advice to management would be to have it where employees can email anonymously to HR and to higher level managers issues they see and hear so that they can watch those individuals for violating company policy. Two, it's too easy for any manager to use the Ontrack system as a tool to take revenge on someone or to get rid of someone they don't like by basing their performance on an objective that is based not on what you and him/her agreed to but on what they think. So even if you do the objective they think that you didn't do it well enough etc. etc.. 

And you only know that your not doing an objective well enough only 2 times a year (mid year review and year end review). So the whole 5 months and 29 days your manager doesn't say anything to you and you think your doing alright. How can you judge a persons performance if said person is only notified 2 times a year?

 Work life balance is very good, if you want it to be. One can easily work long hours if you don't set limits. For the most part, management respects everyone's balance and does not expect overworking.

Sun Jun 18 2017, Associate Director,"Columbus, IN",Former Employee ,Ok - but nasty below the surface,5,"Easy to work there, low expectations, anyone who is moderately good is a ""star performer"". 

Flexible schedule - management doesn't keep track. Most people work 9 to 4:30. 

No travel - except for in specific very high level roles, but this is damaging to some customer facing and product management roles.
","You can't get in front of your customers. Product managers are expected to do all of their work from the office, and therefore are unable to really see what their customers need or how they use the product. 

A lot of lazy people work at Cummins - because it is nearly impossible to get fired for mediocre performance. So - you have a few ""A"" players, very very few, and a lot of people who want a job for life and do hardly anything at all. It's a frustrating environment for ""top talent"" which is why they leave in droves every single year. 
Cummins also prides itself on paying just below median - which also attracts middle level talent. I mean, who stays somewhere, when you are practically guaranteed a higher salary somewhere else. As a manager you are expected to ""work with"" people who are not performing - which leads you, as a manager, to convince other managers to higher them, thus continuing the cycle. 

Very high turnover, due to high performers and low performers both, means that there is no continuity in jobs or management. I had a new boss every 6 months, along with their expectation for my role. 

HR runs the company - employees are existing in an environment where they are terrified to say anything to anyone. It's like a stasi state you are encouraged to ""report others anonymously"" for ""coaching"". 

Also, the hiring of employees on visas is an intentional tactic to keep wages very low. People are hired on visas, when there ARE qualified Americans, I was told to ""ignore that fact"" and just process people through the system in order to increase diversity numbers. When choosing between 2 candidates you are supposed to hire the ""diverse"" candidate even if they are substituting for an American worker.

 Indian tech workers are sequestered in a windowless building in Columbus - but there are hundreds of them from outsourcing companies.

Thu May 25 2017,Anonymous,"Columbus, IN",Former Employee ,Disappointing,7,"If you work at headquarters, then you live in Pawnee, IN....

The work life balance at Cummins is decent (if you aren't in a plant). If you are still at work at 5pm, then you are one of the last people in the office to leave. 

Bonuses are based on performance reviews, and it is surprisingly easy to be above average. 

They have demoted the role of Six Sigma in the business. To someone that is a huge proponent of process improvement that shouldn't be a pro, but the Six Sigma program that Cummins had in place was laughable. It encouraged faulty analysis and meaningless projects that reported huge savings with no noticeable financial impact. In the past it was merely a hoop to jump through to enable promotion.
","Innovation is purposefully painful at Cummins. If you are interested in your career accomplishing something, then I wouldn't recommend working here. I realize that this sounds like an angry former employee, but looking back it was insane how difficult meaningless things were to change. This is evident by the amount of workarounds that exist at the company. There is a joke that Cummins is run by Excel, and that is because critical systems and analysis is done in excel, because none of the corporate systems are capable. Cummins is incentivized by its stock holders to keep doing what they are doing. They are risk-adverse and show it in every decision. 

A few common sayings at Cummins that make me laugh:

Cummins is a supplier of diesel engines to companies that make diesel engines. 9 out of the top 10 customers make their own diesel engines. Translation - Cummins is in a horrible competitive environment. This, along with macro-economic trends, make layoffs and down-sizing a common occurrence (basically every 4-5 years).

Cummins new engines are environmentally friendly. They are so clean that in some places in the U.S. (usually the claim is L.A.) the air coming out of the engine is cleaner than the area going in. They clean the air. Translation - In every other place in the U.S. the air coming out of the engines is dirtier than the air going in... Being better than the past is not itself an accomplishment worthy of praise.

At Cummins most people move positions about every 2 years, so you can try out a bunch of different positions to find what you like. Translation - Most people don't like what they are doing, and are constantly looking for something that they will enjoy at the company. These moves are mostly lateral.
Advice to Management
1. Promote leadership - Managers who match the risk-adverse culture of Cummins are promoted. Make promotion a result of actually proving leadership instead of just job duration. It seems if anyone stayed at the job longer than 3 years, then they were promoted, because everyone else moved positions.

2. Understand diversity - Management seems to have a perverse idea of the meaning of diversity. The homogeneity of ideas and behavior at Cummins is a product of a diversity initiative that is focused on encouraging diversity, but then upon hire, stifling any heterogeneity with standards and procedures. 

3. Invest in IT - It was painful to see critical systems in text-based operating systems. The lack of investment in IT infrastructure was difficult to understand.

2) Small town environment if at headquarters in Columbus
3) Significant growth if you have a Masters in BS
","1) ""Doing the right thing"" is promoted...but in reality this is all show for new employees.
2) Those wishing to transition to middle management will find no development to place into a new role by the company. You are on your own even with historical high performing and high potential ""ratings"" to get a role whereas in the past the company would ensure it's upcoming talent to middle management was placed into key areas.
3) ""Diversity"" is promoted which is indeed important, but the company abuses it to drive work to lower pay & salaries while actively choosing certain candidates to reach a %demographic rather than choose the best employee. At the same time, age/career experience is utilized almost to a discriminatory level still rather than the capabilities of some employees. Company needs to learn that high performers are above ""typical"" levels.
4) ""Restructuring"" has attempted to solve some inefficiencies but in reality it has just attempted to move responsibilities to lower pay grades in the company that are not capable. Cummins no longer values an ""expert"" that will keep Cummins reliability at the forefront while still innovating. Rather, they will place an army of new hires that make the same mistakes the company has made for years and wonder why there are so many fires. Your processes are not air-tight that anyone can do anything. Wake up and value those that actually make a difference and influence key decisions because they have passion.
5) Layoffs - Leadership has constantly miscalculated and reacts to the market leading to layoffs. Great talent is walked out for being in the wrong spot at the wrong time rather than looking to the bigger picture. Enter new employees upon recovery for cheaper and ambitious support...unfortunately enter previously fixed mistakes and pissed of customers.
6) ""Collaborative"" Workspace - in other words you get a small locker and no assigned desk. Detrimental to developing consistent relationships and horrible if in the engineering environment.
Advice to Management
1) Invest in future products in the spirit of Clessie rather than JV's with products that are not innovated by Cummins or supported by Cummins employees. Waiting till the market is mature in a technology is not how Cummins made its name.

","I honestly don't know how Cummins wins any awards for being ethical. They knowingly allow a culture of bullying and favoritism. Recently there were several comments by people from different business groups when an update was posted about their latest ethical workplace award. Everything is fine as long as you go with the flow, don't rock the boat, propose an innovative idea the establishment doesn't agree with, and enjoy having to kiss up to the hierarchy to win favor on the antiquated performance review. Before leaving I heard multiple negative reviews from employees in other groups. The buddy system is alive and well, and don't expect any support from HR if you have a problem. They strictly work for management in a culture of fear and try to make you believe they are listening to you, but the veterans know not to even take anything up with them.
Advice to Management
Where do I begin? Start with firing your entire HR leadership and consider hiring some people from outside to bring a new perspective and modernization. Your review conversations should be meaningful 360 degree feedback. Let employees review your managers without repercussion. Retaliation is ever present in the organization as well as abusive leadership.

Tue Apr 25 2017, Design Engineer,"Rocky Mount, NC",Current Employee ,Company on the Decline,6,"I have been working at Cummins full-time as an engineer for more than 6 years. The company seems to value diversity.
","Forced ranking is the biggest weakness in this company which feeds the every 3-4 year layoff cycle. Layoffs target experienced employees with typically 5 or more years of experience. The longer one stays in the company, the longer he/she is expected to be laid off. The lack of experienced engineers is a direct consequence of this forced lay off which in turn impacts the productivity of the engineering groups.

Another area of concern is the weak and corrupt leadership that is solely driven by political gains over actual work. Management has unrealistic expectations from engineers while there is no training/development plan whatsoever to help them reach even close to those expectations. Favoritism is rampant within organizations and the HR department seems to turn a blind eye to management's unethical behavior. The corporate management is focused on stockholders and not employees. This company is at best an option for college graduates to get a foot in the door but I would not recommend it as a place to build a career.

When I can just hook up some leads and fasten on some exhaust pipes and sit back (in AIR CONDITIONING) and watch the generator run while the automated test runs? It's comparing apples to oranges they're not even in the same class yet we both have the same title as TEST 3?? If you really think I'm just giving my personal opinion, you should take anybody from large test and bring them over to systems and see if they can even catch on after one month and I guarantee 95% of them will fail or would quit, I am 100% positive that you could ask any of them if they would choose systems test over large test and they would all prefer large test it's clear as day!
