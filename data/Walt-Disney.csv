Hiring on as a Temporary assignment leader is hard and I felt the entire time I worked there over two years with a rave review at the end that my job could be lost in an instant. 

Also a lot of busy work made that everyone thought was important but at the end of the day was not productive and just kept managers in offices.

","This is a big company and their primary concern is (safety, but also) guest experience. Even the finest cast members can be treated as disposable considering what a big company it is and how coveted jobs here are. Everything changes quickly and constantly and you have to adjust.
Advice to Management
Coming from a veteran of three different departments, I can honestly say that the most fruitful locations for guest satisfaction are the ones where management makes a deliberate effort to build meaningful connections with their cast. If leaders focus on seeking out bad behavior, cast will quickly lose morale. The biggest management issue I've faced, and this is coming from someone who's obsessed with guest satisfaction, is a subliminal mentality that ""the customer is always right,"" which ultimately tells cast members that they are disposable. I've talked with dozens of elder cast whose innocent love for the company was slowly spent by leaders who demonstrated that they don't truly care for their cast, or that their support ends where the guest experience begins. I don't think this is a majority by any means though. If the atmosphere feels as though each cast member is a professional, invaluable member of our team, we teem at the opportunity to ""make magic"".

Merchandise as well as the food & beverage discounts are a nice perk. The original best perk used to be bringing friends and family into the parks with you.
Many areas offer employment to a diverse range of people from all cultural backgrounds as well as those with disabilities, as long as the area is able to accommodate. For example, someone who is wheelchair bound wouldn't be offered a position where they have to climb ladders
","Staff is under-paid and overworked. Work life balance does not exist. I experienced peers getting reprimanded for things they shouldn't be reprimanded for. Now with the park reservation system, cast members essentially cannot enter the parks let alone bring family and friends along.
Executives care more about themselves than about the frontline workers. If that was not the case, they would not have accepted their full pay AND bonuses back prior to cast members coming back to work. The executives got their pay and bonuses back at the cost of 30,000+ cast members' jobs.
You cannot move up if you do not know people but in order to know people, you have to have a work life balance to meet with them. Many areas are overworked so you get off the clock extremely tired.

","Disney pays below the industry standard. Opportunities for advancement/growth are limited and rely heavily on networking and/or personal connections.

Advice to Management
During my time with the company, I held several managerial roles. The lower level management has their hands tied to be able to improve the working environment for their Cast Members. Senior level executives seemed more concerned with self preservation than about addressing concerns that really could make a difference. Feedback was discouraged and speaking up often meant being ostracized or reprimanded. Also, there needs to be a much greater focus on recognition. There is far too much emphasis placed on the discipline metrics and not enough focus on work/life balance, recognition and Cast development. Managers are expected to work 50+ hours/week and it is not uncommon due to the progressive scheduling practices to not have adequate time for recovery between shifts.

Advice to Management
Plenty of talent that worked outside Disney. When you have a 21 year old leader that never worked anywhere else before(true story) in a management position, put there because they where in the college program 6 months earlier as their first job, dont expect good results and fellow cast member respect. Also don't expect them to see talent other than their social club for advancement. I've seen many overqualified cast just leave because of burnout hitting that wall. Sure they did well after but Disney is losing good talented people because of this.

Park access.
","Low pay relative to the industry.

Due to so many cast members having decades of seniority, it is almost impossible, even after 3 years, to get any holidays off. So I hope you don't care about spending Christmas or Thanksgiving with your family. 

Corporate is so focused on making a huge profit that the policies that are rolled out end up forcing frontline cast members to violate fundamental values such as prioritizing creating happiness. 

Corporate and Line of business are so resistant to investing the small amount of money needed to fix things (like upgrading computers that are 10 years old and can't run the necessary software fast enough to serve guests well) and would rather just throw money at the guests who complain to make the problem go away than actually solve the problem. Which, ironically, in the long run, ends up being more costly. 

Also, even with excellent job performance, it can be incredibly slow to advance.
Advice to Management
Invest the money in actually taking care of your cast, not just ""paying off"" the entitled guest who yells the loudest and throws the biggest temper tantrum. Trust your cast, or don't hire them. 

Bob Chapek only cares about the shareholders and profitability, he has little to no regard for the actual cast. Thankfully this is not true of all senior leadership.

Fri Oct 30 2020, Entertainment/Performer,"Orlando, FL",Current Employee ,It truly can be magical.,0,"Working for the biggest theme parks in the world can be incredibly rewarding. In any role you take on, whether it is in entertainment, guest relations, server, housekeeping... you make people happy. I have been with this company for over twenty years and a job is really what you make of it. Great coworkers can make your day; guests who come back over and over become family. If you come in with a positive, open attitude, you will have the time of your life. Health insurance and other benefits are also wonderful.
","Admittedly, it can be taxing. Your schedule may be all over the place at times, and you may have a lot of physical labor, depending on your position. Sometimes, guests can take their frustrations out on you. Remember that it’s what they’re dealing with, and not a reflection on yourself. Pay can be rough, especially if you are in the college program, but don’t let that deter you. The unions continuously do their best to increase wages and benefits. Nobody and no job is perfect, but I still feel I should give the company a five star review because the positive experiences have far outweighed the negative. This may not be the case for everyone, bad things can happen in any job. But if you give the company a chance, you’ll hopefully have more pros than cons, too.

If you come in at a manager level or higher, the compensation can be huge. But, there is a price to pay for this type of package....see cons below. 

2. Brand - The Disney brand will get you mileage in your career. You will make some good connections, but also some bad ones...see below.
","Overall, DTCI is a toxic environment, with a few decent people mixed in. You will encounter nepotism. I witnessed interns getting promoted from intern to senior manager rapidly, while those who have been honestly working hard have been bypassed, simply because they did not suck up to their leaders or make the right friendships. You will not get promoted based on your skills or merit. You will also encounter various forms of being undermined by your peers, with a few exceptions. Sabotage of work, gossiping and spreading rumors, and back-stabbing are common. This is not a collaborative environment, it is COMPETITIVE. You will also encounter machiavellian types, narcissists, and bullies on a daily basis. If you have a soul, it will be crushed. If you're soulless, this is the place for you.

Communicate with your people. Relying strictly on social media and announcing things to the world before your own people really hurts morale. Also, direct managers need to be more understanding. Stop picking favorites and work with everyone on your team instead of relying on a select few. Everyone needs opportunities to grow.

If you are willing to put in the hard work, Disney is an outstanding place to be.
","Things tend to happen a bit slower at Disney in terms of projects and decision making. This may frustrate some who prefer quicker results, but I personally love how careful and thoughtful Disney is about everything it does, from the largest to the smallest details.

Advice to Management
Focus more on talent management training for frontline parks and resorts managers. Around time for performance reviews, they tend to only look at performance in the month closest to the review instead of the entire year. I noticed other biases as well, like typically high performing employees still receiving a high review even if they performed worse that year - just because that’s their typical rating in past years.

Free park passes and discounts to hotels and merchandise.
","My full time job offer was rescinded weeks before my start date. 

Right up to the very end, my job offer was confirmed to be secure by Disney multiple times throughout the pandemic.

So it came as a total shock to me when the offer was suddenly pulled right after I graduated from college this summer.

I learned the hard way that a signed employment offer from Disney doesn't mean much!

Unfortunately, my experience is far from unique as I have since learned that Disney has pulled many job offers over the last couple of months. 

I guess they are trying to cut costs drastically to make their earning numbers look better than expected to Wall Street during the pandemic.

What's also upsetting is that after pulling all these job offers, Disney found money to donate $5 million to ""social causes"". 

That $5 million could have been used to pay for the salaries of the poor grads whose offers were rescinded by Disney.

But I guess it's more important to Disney to maintain their public do good image than to keep their promises.

","There's a lot to go here. There is a lot of political red tape that happens all around you. I found myself running into massive walls left and right when trying to address problems with the way things were being done. The phrase ""That's not the Disney way"" is thrown around a lot. Sure Disney has been around and what they've been doing seems to work, but they're not innovating or moving. They're stagnant and that's not good. They like to silo people to the point I had no idea what my other team mates were doing because they don't encourage communication and they sure as heck don't care much about team morale.

They've got several legal and technological departments, a moving set of standards that are essentially a la carte. Don't like a policy put out by infosec? That's fine! Just ignore it! Bring up an issue to have it addressed by leadership? Your immediate leaders will listen (which is good!) Once you're past director level they are so removed from everything that they don't care as long as they get them bonuses. This means at any point in time millions are being wasted on aging technology that needs to be updated but won't be because of ""reasons"".

That brings us full circle to some of the other issues. The way Disney has handled this pandemic was bad at the best. People are/were on indefinite furloughs and teams are being ground to dust because executive leadership hasn't ever worked with a team that doe thing X so they don't know what to do with them and instead of learn they do the microsoft thing of Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. There aren't many opportunities that bubble up from within, at least not up north, down in california sure.
Advice to Management
Stop copy and pasting responses, actually read what your employees are telling you and do something about it.

Executives reconnect with your humanity and start treating those underneath like they are worth something instead of something you stepped in.
