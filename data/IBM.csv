","Company is mostly focused on revenues and convoluted outdated processes for compliance and regulations. Way too many project managers that just push paper and not enough people to actually get the work done. Company seems to be primarily focused on short term profits and cost cutting rather than customer care or retention. Feels like a factory where everything is a machine or resource including the people. Very large push to reduce US based staff and replace with offshore staff. With current plans to split company, leadership and direction is lacking. Communication between management layers is dismal at best. Constant firefighting and reactionary mode. Very high stress with little to no reward. Expectation is to get the job done while constantly being pulled in several directions without the ability to focus on a single task. Everything is a priority all the time.
Advice to Management
Fix leadership and bureaucratic red tape processes (multiple processes for same initiative) way too many different tools and rules for interoperability. Allow the talented people to focus on what they are good at without tying their hands with unnecessary, redundant and confusing processes. Make it easy and simple to get the actual work completed. First line managers should not be in a position to use ambiguous and unclear language when providing direction for work or processes.

I have been working at IBM full-time for more than a year
Pros
Salary and that's about it. IBM seems to focus heavily on frontloading salary and signing bonuses to get people in the door.

The company still looks good on a resume for now.
Cons
For GBS it's a 44-hour workweek minimum to make utilization targets. The 44 hours thing is set up to dilute our hourly rate on bids. You will not promote if you only put in 44 hours though.

Management is full of fake leaders and buzzwords. There is a great deal of lip-service leadership going around and little actual leadership. Promotion seems based on loyalty and brown-nosing, so many managers in leadership positions don't actually know what they are doing.
Advice to Management
Cull management and leadership. IBM is massively top-heavy and keeps losing good new talent because it refuses to accept it's leadership problems.

- theres no job security, this isnt the company is used to be where once you were in you make a long term career in a single place. Thats a fairy tale here now
- they value where you live over your skillset. IBM used to be very remote work friendly and that has changed 180 degrees the past few years as they force you to relocate or lose your job (even if you arent remote but are officed in one location - RTP - and they move your business unit to NY or Austin you have to move or they consider it a voluntary resignation). Even then many have been laid off months after relocating.
- God help you if you are over 55 - dead man walking

","Questionable behavior from management.

Covid 19 made a difficult situation for everyone at every level of work (which is why this is a 2 star review and not a 1 star).

For the apprenticeship in BR, you're promised to learn a variety of IT skills over the course of a year--it's a written document with a fairly unambiguous skills list. What I experienced was an implicit pressure to learn the tools relevant to the team I was working under, and forego learning anything unrelated. The plan seemed to be to just get some quick videos to watch that direct management could verify were reviewed and then check a box.

Speaking to different levels of management about it felt like I was being brushed off (though in a very polite manner).

Once covid 19 really started to take off, apprentices were placed on a, ""project,"" involving the unemployment claims systems along with other IBM organizations. We were initially told we would be rotated out in a month, and we would still have the time to work on our apprentice material.

The month came and went. Those promises left with it, and so did I. 

The pandemic situation has been dynamic, so I can't blame anyone for not knowing how long it would last or moving the goal post so to speak. However, the BR apprenticeship seemed like a means of gathering unsuspecting individuals with the hope of a future in IT, and locking them into a low pay role for an extended period. 

Those with talent and free time would build their skills on their own time, and eventually move on to a location where they can make 2 or 3 times as much money. Those without, would be stuck.
Advice to Management
If your sales pitch starts with ""We want to help you develop, and whether or not you choose to stay with IBM at the end of your apprenticeship, you will have a good set of skills in the end and be a spokesperson for IBM technology.

I should not in a meeting with my manager ever hear, ""You wouldn't want to take all of these skills and leave, would you?""

I should not be in a situation where the advertised learning is being put on the chopping block because ""that won't be important to work on this team, right?""

In test, you can be impressed by the broad set of skills that allow the team to push our stack in a variety of ways. Now that I'm leading a support organization as VP, IBM Z Support and Linux Client Care, what astonishes me is the level of passion and skills I have seen over and over again in just my first 6 months on the job, to allow our clients to get the most out of the IBM Z platform. Support makes it real -- I worked directly with clients before and heard a ton about why they trusted IBM to run their business, but in support you see it up close each and every day.

Access to lots of talent, team work culture with everyone willing to contribute, great technology and very strong vision. Global scale and resources. Deep industry expertise.
Cons
Corporate overhead is killing competitiveness. Deals are burdened with it, resulting is low margins and increased risk due to team sizes cut to the bone. The indirect overheads come from old real estate and an excessive number of executives on high salaries falling over themselves to be associated with a deal.
Advice to Management
Stop culling direct labour and focus on indirect. Find a way of eliminating corporate overhead. Provide better financial incentives to band 8-10s to sell and deliver cost takeouts. 

Implement a proper resource management function that matches skills to roles. At present team members cannot career plan as they have no idea what next assignment will be and often the case will take any role to stay billable and avoid resource actions. This results in skills erosion and low utilisation. 

Exercise caution with new executives, there is a toxic culture developing with executives playing politics with financials and responsibilities. Additionally many new to job executives are bullying staff whom are afraid to report it.

I have been working at IBM full-time for more than a year
Pros
The base pay can be very good (shoot for the moon on the way in and they will match - learned this the hard way) and the work is pretty easy.
Cons
No bonuses or comp upside aside from base salary, 401k matching policy is a joke that was put into place to save IBM money vs. showing they care about employees, still lots of legacy IBMers around which results in tons of internal infighting and not doing the right thing for the customer, and there is little human empathy. People just expect to answer your phone whenever they call - you just have to ignore them or say no. There is no point in letting it suck your soul if they aren't going to reward you for performance.
Advice to Management
Hire new blood who can actually transform the company and break down internal silos. Reward employees and give them an incentive to perform/stay in the long run.

I have been working at IBM full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Schedule Flexibility, Benefits, Paid Expenses via no hassle Amex Card, corporate paid mobile, ability to travel around the world, great salary and bonus NOT soley in RSU's like most tech companies. I personally do not want to gamble on my bonus and future salary. great use of industry tools for communication and development, lots of free learning, not just IBM products
Cons
IBM is large with over 300k employees around the world, I can see how some might at first feel lost. Quiet introverts would have a hard time I think. Obviously this isnt a startup company so no startup excitement feel. Vacation time is low at the beginning. look past that, IBM is very flexible with time off.
Advice to Management
KEEP full work from home! There is no need to go back to old logic and thinking employees need to be on premise to be effective. Keep competitive with bonus and pay, do not follow the trend of issuing RSU like AWS and others do, this will make the difference in hiring and keeping talent.

Pros
It's great to work at a company that is on the leading edge. The leading edge means that we need to be constantly learning and evolving. IBM has great recognition programs and also great basic benefits.
Cons
Aside from specific classes that last a day/week, the learning is expected to be ongoing on top of client billable work. So, you can expect to work more than 40 hours/week. Therefore, it is very important to manage your own work/life balance (but support is available)!

Thu Dec 17 2020, Software Developer,"Cambridge, MA",Current Employee ,Great Experience in First Few Months,0,"Of the dozens of people I interact with, not a single one has an ego. Everyone is passionate about what we work on and it is an absolute pleasure and privilege to work with them. I started this summer and have truly not had a single negative experience. I'm still finding my way, but my co-workers are extremely intelligent and driven individuals. I can't speak to other divisions, but the Watson squads are above and beyond.

To sum up the general vibe, I would say just about everyone, including senior management, are genuine and honest people motivated by common sense.
","There's really nothing to complain about in the 5 months I've worked here. But to explain my 4-star ratings:

Compensation and Benefits: The salary is nothing to scoff at, but it is slightly lower than what my friends are making at big-name companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Disney, and Salesforce once adjusted for cost-of-living. Most of my other job offers were a bit higher and came with stock options. 

Work/Life Balance: It is very good in general, and I don't know how it is when people work in the office, but while WFH, there are a decent number of people who work outside of the 9-5 range. Given how much it seems my co-workers enjoy what they do, some of them have the live-to-work mentality and often work more than 8 hours a day. That being said, it is definitely not expected for one to work more than 8 hours a day.
Advice to Management
If anything, just that working from home doesn't do any favors to making connections with co-workers, which is frustrating with this being my first job out of college. It would be nice if more were done to help out new hires in this regard. 

I also wouldn't say that the onboarding was the strongest in the sense that there wasn't really any crash-course in the company like I've had in internships. It wasn't until I was working here for a few months that I learned how things like vacation time and promotions worked. Again, this is my first job out of college, so that could also be the norm.

Parts of IBM are extremely well managed and up-to-date, with healthy cultures, others have awful outdated processes, terrible cultures, or management that lead through fear instead of intelligence.

Thu Dec 17 2020, User Experience Designer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Incredible culture & great people,0,"I preface this by saying I have a fantastic manager and a very supportive team (IBM Cloud). I'm in the Austin design studio, which if you are in the US is probably where you want to be to get the most out of IBM's design culture. Experiences definitely vary based on your manager & your studio location.

Here are the Pros I can think of:
- I cannot say enough good things about the culture here. People are super smart and are willing to share their knowledge with you. The culture is very collaborative and growth / learning oriented. I see people getting promoted and getting awards regularly and they're not just empty gestures. If you did good, impactful work for IBM, and you have a good manager, then you will likely get some kind of recognition within your team and even across IBM design or your department. It's also a fun culture - e.g. our VP of design did a Tik Tok to promote Think2020 conference; the Austin studio (and other locations too) takes Halloween very seriously with a floor-wide theme, costume contest, and decked-out decorations. e.g. we transformed our space into a Stranger Things mall with food, booze, etc. Halloween is super fun and is really unique to IBM design culture. 

- Feedback is very valued. My team does pulse surveys I think every year or quarter (I forget) and takes feedback very seriously. They also have engagement pulse surveys across IBM Design, and I have seen managers taking action to improve the culture. 

- IBM is very design-mature (aka design is valued even outside design teams). Everyone I have collaborated with at least understands the well-structured Enterprise Design Thinking methodology or concepts, and I don't have to waste my energy trying to advocate for the importance of design. I've felt that as a designer I'm equally important as offering management (basically product management) & developer teams. The last aspect of design maturity is that user research is valued; we have dedicated research teams and actually do usability testing & interviews to inform our designs. This is unique to mature design companies like IBM.

- Great starting place for fresh grads or anyone who just pivoted to the design industry. They have a great design bootcamp where you learn hands-on how to apply IBM's Enterprise Design Thinking to real IBM projects, and it helps you get on the same baseline footing when starting out. There's a lot of good investment in ensuring new designers feel supported when first joining IBM.

- Free snacks in the Austin studio (better than none!) back when we were still going to the office.

- Access to anyone at IBM that you want to talk to! For example, if you want to chat with people who are experts in future-facing things like blockchain, AI/Watson, etc, VR/AR, quantum computing.... these experts are unique to IBM. Nobody's stopping you from talking to these people to learn more, and it helps that we have Slack to facilitate quicker communication.

- I'm not as involved in this stuff, but diversity & inclusion seems decent, though they are reluctant to release numbers. The good thing is that IBM Design is actively working on ways to improve these things; there is a diversity & inclusion committee and regular panel talks to address issues and encourage a more diverse IBM.
","- No annual salary increases to adjust for inflation, which is a little ridiculous. Most companies - especially tech companies - do this. Starting salary is ok but since there's no increases, you're basically losing your worth as you gain more experience each year unless you get promoted.

- This is a relatively no frills company, even if you are in the Austin design studio. If you really value perks like fancy high rise offices, free lunch, super high salaries / bonuses / stock buybacks / etc. like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc., I'm not sure IBM is going to work for you. Unfortunately this is the tradeoff for a truly great culture, I guess. (I have heard less good things about the culture at those competitors with their fancy perks though.)

- Perf is weird, it's officially once a year but you can discuss at any time. Not a con per say, but it's 100% up to you though to drive these discussions and advocate for yourself with your manager (likely not unique to IBM though).

- Some time zone differences. For my particular team, many of the developers I work with are in China. We just meet once every 2 weeks, but this also makes collaboration and communication a bit harder. On the other hand it's kind of cool to work with people across the world. I also work with developers across the US in CA & NC. Not all teams are this distributed though.
Advice to Management
Bring back annual salary increases due to inflation
Keep the culture of recognition up
Stay a leader in the design-maturity-at-scale space

","Culture is hugely dependent on which business unit your role falls under and your job function. There's zero transparency on job cuts (which they harshly refer to as ""resource actions""), yet these happen nearly every year and affect most areas of the business.

Thu Dec 17 2020, Applications Architect,"Houston, TX",Current Employee ,GBS North America technical roles are below industry standard,1,"The benefits are about the same as other large companies. Internal tools are acceptable. Lots of emphasis on training with free online courses.
","IBM is a big company and experiences are different in each country, as well as in the different divisions within IBM and the roles that are done. I work in GBS, North America, and the pay is far below industry standard for equivalent skills. 50 hour work weeks are expected, and the pay doesn't reflect that. There are no significant raises, no promotions, and no awards. Travel is expected and, in many cases, is in addition to the 50 hours of customer billable time. There continues to be a focus to move all US technical jobs overseas or into low-cost (low paying) IBM centers, so all technical jobs are assumed to be expendable at any time. ""Resource Actions"" happen at least once a year, where upper level management chooses a skill and randomly fires hundreds, if not thousands, of employees - and it's not based on performance (and generally affects the older, higher-paid employees). Upper level management does an awful lot of patting themselves on the back with one hand for their great decisions, while never actually growing the company: very few executives are ever fired for incompetence - and they never admit that they might be the problem: their explanation is that the problem is with the line employees for not billing enough hours. First line managers can not ""manage"" employees because they have their own non-employee-management goals that they are paid/rewarded for (like finding new business or performing technical jobs), as opposed to paying them for successfully helping their team.
Advice to Management
Bring salaries in line with other large tech companies - and if you want the top people, you have to pay more than the other companies; fire executives when they don't meet their goals; stop the Resource Actions; have first-line employee managers be paid and rewarded for good employee management.

I worked at IBM full-time
Pros
- Traveling to different places
- Meeting different kinds of clients and co-workers
- Office space was nice
- Many intelligent co-workers
- If you can survive for two years, it is very easy to go to another firm
Cons
- Managers ask you to lie about your work hours, so you end up working 12-14 a day and don't get paid for it (against the supposed company policy, but that's IBM for you)
- Incredibly sexist
- Public consulting has better work hours, so commercial consulting is the worse off section to work in (see the first bullet)
- You receive several managers above you, and no one really cares much where you are going, just if you are doing your job (you can't switch positions, you can't ask for training for your area of work, you can't receive support in harassment situations)
- Do not work in DC if you are in commercial consulting - no one from that area comes to the office so networking is difficult
- For some reason, the upper level of the office had a nice coffee maker, and the downstairs had terrible coffee which eventually was taken away altogether - pretty symbolic of how the upper level really doesn't care much for lower levels (and it was just bizarre not to have any access to coffee when that is essentially the first item companies have?). Hopefully, they fixed this by now.
- Taking vacations will lower your utilization rate, so even if you have time to take off, don't if you're close to the borderline where you get fired
- There were several phases of layoffs, particularly the newly hired, which was incredibly unlucky for those who didn't get a chance to have any project experience (I believe this got rectified because IBM over hired college students)
- Getting fired was very easy; heard about co-workers who were in the wrong place at the wrong time with little to no heads up
- Getting the right manager was uncommon as the good ones always left IBM quickly, so chances are you are going to get a manager that pushes you around, throws you under the bus, and asks you to work weekends/late nights with no heads up. If you get one of the good ones, they are fantastic. 
- There is definitely an IBM character: focused on work, no time for hobbies (unless it is exercise), comes off cold, enjoys networking, family comes second, enjoys talking about what status they have in each airline/hotel chain. If you fit that stereotype, then this is a great place for you - it just wasn't aligning with my values.

Advice to Management
Shareholder primacy is largely to blame for IBM's rapidly declining business. In times where we should have been investing in new tech, we were buying back stock and cutting R&D to increase EPS. We damaged our reputation with customers by chasing ever-increasing profit margins and cutting back the teams that manage customer relationships. We no longer attract the best talent because we don't offer competitive compensation and ownership stake to anyone but the highest tier employees, unlike our competitors. The only way to turn this around is to make significant investments now in new tech and customer relationships that will take years to make money and do so at the expense of shareholder interests in the near term. A renewed focus on usage and experience rather than revenue and profit is necessary, but I fear that that ship has sailed and we will now continue this path to slowly fade into irrelevance.

A renewed focus on usage and experience rather than revenue and profit is necessary, but I fear that that ship has sailed and we will now continue this path to slowly fade into irrelevance.

","No room for moving up in the company, poor management skills from the managers, an 'everybody for themselves' atmosphere, little teamwork, management not owning up to their mistakes and blaming other coworkers, and little to no training for your position. Good luck if you get hired, you'll be reprimanded for not understanding your job on the first day. And you'll be reprimanded for asking questions about your job. Just look elsewhere for anyone considering IBM to apply to.
Advice to Management
Learn how to properly train your employees, especially during COVID. No one in my office was prepared or willing to train during COVID as I was hired shortly before the lock downs occurred. I was never properly trained for my position. Although you like to boast about how amazing and spectacular IBM is, you ride off your past successes with nothing to show. Huge layoffs near a third of your staff in total doesn't show success, that shows this company is going downhill. Not to mention your revenue has continually fallen for the past 10 years. Quit pandering to the masses with your fake sympathy for those suffering from COVID or from the George Floyd movement that sprung up earlier this year. Picking out a random black employee and saying 'See?! We're not racist!!' and making a video on your hired such employee doesn't make you a company that stands with that movement, and makes you pathetic to your current employees. Quit pushing social justice movements down our throats by emailing us frequent updates on the movements and 'courses' we could take. We don't buy you care about people nor your employees, or their feelings on the movement or COVID. You just care about making money (which you haven't for years), be honest.
