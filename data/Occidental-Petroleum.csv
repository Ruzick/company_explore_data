Wed Dec 23 2020, Oil Rig Operator,"Greeley, CO",Former Employee ,Great place to work and build lasting relationships. It changed my life!,0,"I loved my job at Anadarko (now Occidental)! The relationships I made there (and one in particular) changed my life forever, and truly set me on a completely different course than I ever anticipated.

I loved that most of what I did there was outside, and it gave me an excuse to get out and get some fresh air, even in the middle of the night. They gave me a company vehicle to drive, and it really came in handy when I needed to haul personal items with or for my family. I pretty much had free reign of the property, and there was enough room on site to store personal items, as well.

Even though some things came up in my personal life that led to my separation there, I don’t have anything but good memories of my time at Anadarko. I kind of regret the way I behaved my last day on the job, and I left some things behind that other people ended up having to clean up in my absence (literally and figuratively). It was kind of embarrassing, but it’s like no real big deal, I’m sure.

For now, I’m staying busy and still working with some petroleum products. One day, I’m sure that that last day there will just be an old memory, and I can probably go back to Anadarko (now Oxy), if I ever move back to Colorado from my current residence in Wisconsin. I will be sure to bring my updated resume and hope for the best. I can’t wait to be back there, even though I hear that they removed my favorite oil batteries.

Sun Mar 29 2020,Anonymous,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,The worst company I have ever known of,9,"Absolutely nothing positive about Oxy.
","Upper management are some of the most worthless and worst decision makers in all of history. The Anadarko deal was an atrocious and dismal decision which absolutely ruined the company, and ruined many of the employees through layoffs and many more to come in the future, along with compensation cuts for all employees.
The entire company is extremely silo'd. The right hand never knows what the left hand is doing. So much wasted work is performed because of this.
Despicable business practices are common place. Numerous cases of harassment and discrimination have been raised to HR, but they sweep everything under the rug and still allow those practices to continue, and completely support those managers and executives.
There is absolutely no trust by executive and upper management for the employees. Oxy was one of the last companies to institute work from home due to the Coronavirus, because they could not trust their employees, and they didn't care if their lives were on the line. As another example, simple low cost workovers had to to all be approved by the CEO, even before the Saudi and Russia market share war led to a drop in prices, because executive management does not trust employees to do their jobs.
It is a completely micro-management culture, with most managers and executives dictating exactly how work should be performed. They want trained monkeys, and not independent thinkers.
There is no accountability, even from the top. Executive management blames everything on external factors, not learning from their mistakes. As an example, executive management blames the downfall of the company on the Opec+ price war and the coronavirus, not once recognizing that they made one of the worst decisions in history with the Anadarko purchase (which was ridiculed throughout the industry even at the time). Another case in point is that when they made 30% salary cuts across the corporation, the CEO couldn't even be bothered to make the announcement, but she put it on one of her subordinates to deliver the message. Another case in point, is that when dealing with Icahn in determining control of the corporation, the CEO only cared about saving her job, and made a deal with the devil in order to do so. She also instituted a poison pill against investors from buying a large number of shares in the company, because she wanted to retain as much control as possible.
The pay, benefits, and working environment are worse than most companies. Therefore, the quality of employees at Oxy are much less than at other Oil & Gas companies I have encountered. Also, many of the best left with the voluntary separation package, leaving behind a ton of dead weight.
There is a ton of backstabbing throughout the company, especially against the talented and the innovators. Oxy is more interested in having individuals who tow the line and do exactly what they are told by incompetent upper management.
Worst company I've ever known of or worked at, and I have worked at many throughout my long career. STAY AWAY!!!
Advice to Management
None. Upper management will likely (thankfully) be gone before the end of 2020. They have made some of the worst decisions in the history of large corporations, right up there with Enron. I feel sorry for many of the employees. They will never truly recover, and be what they once were or could have become.

Sun Mar 29 2020, Staff Engineer,"Houston, TX",Current Employee ,Witness the destruction of a once great company,6,"Oxy was once an admired company with fiscal discipline and good management.
","Over the years, this has been progressively stripped away by lethargy, complacency, nepotism and favoritism; perverted to the point where cartels in various departments are so abstracted from reality that any semblance of rational decision making has been abandoned.

The apex of this hubris and detachment from the real world and real employees was the purchase of Anadarko. Only someone who thinks that they can do no wrong would elect to outbid a company far larger and more successful; clearly the fact that David vs Goliath being a story was lost among the yes-men. 

The company is now staring at bankruptcy with salaries cut by 30%, promotions and increases halted and benefits slashed. Careers are being ended or placed on hold, all because Oxy leadership structured the company in such a way that the 12th man in 12 angry men, the voice of dissent and reason was silenced or pushed out across the company.

","If you are technically good, think of it as a curse. You will be taking orders from people who have zero technical skills or people who have never implemented any systems in their life. You will wonder how these people got promoted to be IT managers. In technology and financial companies even IT directors will have coding or technical skills. You will be disappointed and frustrated because a person with technical skills will go nowhere as they will make you their work horse to take credit. Sincere advice for people with technical skills is to either find another job else where or dumb down your technical prowess when you join Oxy. Dumber you act, you will get promoted. Only handful of managers are technical, rest of them either don’t know business or technology. Only thing they know is politics. It is a shame such people are IT managers.
Advice to Management
IT managers need to have some technical or business skill to command respect from the subordinates. Recognize true technical skills that people bring to the table. Those are the technical folks who are keeping the lights on at Oxy. If I was the CIO I would fire 25% of the staff who don’t bring any value to the organization. Hope they take this advice in the right spirit.

","Oxy used to be a very fulfilling place to work. Employees used to be empowered to make decisions and implement ideas. We were nimble and flexible. After a disasterous reorganization executed by some bean counting consulting group, bureaucracy is becoming stifling. Technical employees are no longer empowered to make decisions. Decisions are made by an increasingly large and unnecessary cadre of mid-level managers who spend their time trying to expand their political influence and don't consult their direct reports when decisions are made. Much of the hard work by the rank and file employees goes unnoticed and unused.

It's essentially impossible to get into the management track if you are a geoscientist. The limited number of management positions are filled either by reservoir engineers with 3 years of experience or by beneficiaries of nepotism. Geoscience managers are constantly promising to rotate employees but it never happens because they don't have any power to do so (thank you for trying at least). You basically have to threaten to quit...they will never offer you a new project or assignment. As such, career opportunities are basically nonexistent. If you like working the same field in the Permian for the next few years without any real challenge or potential for professional development then this is your place. If you don't like change and you don't like pressure, this is your place.

Go back to small multifunctional teams. They work better. Make an effort to rotate employees to different projects instead of just allowing the mid-managers to block people from opportunities.

I have been working at Occidental Petroleum
Pros
401k and retirement benefits are good.
Cons
Benefits normally good but has been bad for past two years.. no more bonuses, no yearly increments in salary for inflation adjustment, very lean staff. lots of work, long hour. some managers are cruel. no compensation for after hours on-call work.One team was reduced to 60% but was never replaced by a single person. NO growth at all. You will be stuck with your job if you are good at it.

","In corporate functions, it's ""every man/woman for him/herself"" mentality, a dog-eat-dog, devil take the hindmost culture.

Not a good environment, but if you can survive, this is a good company.

- Lots of opportunity for resilient entrepreneurial individuals that don't need a lot of structure.

I worked at Occidental Petroleum full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
6% matching 401k. Separate retirement account that amounts to about $2500 a year. Higher than average bonus (10-15%; higher if you are one of the ""chosen"" ones).
Cons
Don't let them fool you with their slightly better than average benefits package. They are WAY low on base salary. I know this because I left and got over a 20% raise. It would have taken me between 4 and 5 years more at Oxy to get that type of raise. I'm not the only one. I know of many people who feel the same way. Average raises, year by year, are around 3%. When you start at 50 or 60k, it will take you a very long time to catch up to where you should be.

The politicking here is crazy. Employees WILL stab you in the back - it happened to me by more than one person. Not only that, but to get anywhere you MUST ""do what you're told"". If you don't brown nose it's very hard to get anywhere. Managers have their favorites. Oh, and don't get on the ""blacklist."" If you do you're virtually out of the running to be manager or basically anything other than ""IT drone."" I can't tell you how many people got their MBA's paid for by Oxy then had to leave because they would not promote them.

One last thing I want to mention. There is little explanation on why some people get certain benefits and others don't. This includes ""project bonuses"" as well as extra Stock incentive. They never fully explain, if they even mention these things to you which they probably won't, how you get them. If you don't know about these things then the don't have to give them to you, right?

They actually have a retirement plan in addition to the matching 401k plan. The employees have a tendency to stay here for a long time. They really do try to value their human capital - at least for everyone except IT. If you work on the O&G side of things (Geologist, etc), I hear the pay is pretty awesome. Vacation time is generous - you also get sick time that doesn't count against your vacation days.
They are moving to a service-oriented (think ITIL/ITSM) IT model. This is a good thing.
","They treat IT infrastructure people as pure cost. System admins burn out due to the constant ""do more with less"" mentality and absolutely zero appreciation. High turnover rate there. 
Expect to be on call, and to be told that you need to be attached to your phone even when you're NOT on call. Pay is below industry average. 
If you are early (or early-ish) career, the 'bonus' is almost an insult. 
IT raises are also a joke. If you want an appreciable bump in pay, be prepared to move to another company, or pray that you can move to a different group within Oxy and get a promotion in the process.
No 365 reviews of management. Some of the managers are absolutely terrible - but they know how to take credit for other people's work and throw their people under the bus, so upper management thinks they're great. If you can market yourself well, you'll probably do fine. Favoritism is pretty rampant in some areas.

Storage, Server Admins, Network, infrastructure tools like AD and Citrix, these people are the backbone that make it possible.

I would recommend Oxy as a career choice (as in, stay there for 20) if you work somewhere other than any kind of IT role that isn't application (ie Maximo) specific - but after more than two years at Oxy, I honestly couldn't in good conscience recommend Oxy to any kind of IT infrastructure professional. The pay is lower than industry average, and so is the level of appreciation. I really hope you can fix this shortcoming.

","Politics rule promotions, it's not what you know, it's who. Despite their assertion people are not their primary resource, with all of the reorganization and becoming a smaller company means less people, therefore they overwork the people that are there, use the performance review system to beat people down, are obsessed with head count and would rather pay 3 times as much using consultants to get rid of a direct employee. I can't see how spending 3x more money for the convenience of being able to get rid of someone without having to fabricate a case in the performance review system is a benefit to the company. Low morale in most people who have been there a while and are honest. There is no pay for performance, and anyone that says there is just happens to be on the sunny side of the field for now or is a sacrificial anode. Oxy pays for blind obedience, inner circles are filled with yes men asking what's in it for them, you are expected to push the ethics envelope, not visibly of course and if you don't you become a liability or at best someone on the way out.

Senior contract staff can help guide you on technical approaches to projects and where you should focus on developing skills. Only financial benefits are recent retention bonuses, but they have now stopped. Young engineers can gain from quick advancement, if not in leadership roles then in pay grade, because the older engineers have left.
","Oxys reputation is the lowest in the industry and, as a result, many people have left once they realize why. In fact, the turnover is so large that graduates five years out of college are given the title of senior engineer - which is ridiculous given the level of experience that this position usually requires.

Oxy is a very cliquish company, with people even slightly different from the archaic culture being driven out. The company makes a show of being safety orientated, but in reality production and the bottom line are the priorities. This can be seen in their safety performance which is another example of the low level of concern for peoples well being - particularly from HR.

There is a great deal of victimization within the company, with stonewalling on performance reviews being very unproductive. Accountability only seems to apply to certain people.

Salaries are very low compared to majors such as Chevron and Conoco and, despite Oxys inability to attract talent, pay raises and overall compensation remain laughable. Assets in California and Texas are really the only location options - Libya and Oman being the primary oversees options and North Dakota extremely challenging for anyone in the current oil and gas climate.

I worked at Occidental Petroleum full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Great benefits, of course. The pay rate is better than you'll often get at other places for a similar workload. Everything is laid out in writing - no surprises from HR and no hollering bosses or anything like that. There are plenty of people to share the workload, and in addition to this, there is plenty of money to get hardware/software/consultants as needed. This is an oil company, and it is very profitable.
Cons
Cons are those of a large company. You have a specific role. You won't do much outside that role - you will not wear a lot of hats because those are other people's turf. In this sense, your skillset may suffer. You will develop a new set of skills however, and this is of the large corporation, which is something you cannot emulate at a small shop no matter the conditions. There are a lot of formalities and red tape, however, everything is done at a very high quality if you compare that to what is done by other institutions and corporations that are smaller and less formal. It takes effort to get things done - and patience.

If you are interested in international work, the locations that Oxy has to offer are limited...Houston, California, and a couple of places in South America and the Middle East are the only locations Oxy has to offer.

-Not stuck in one place. Lots of opportunities to move around (leadership position or to different departments). Good experience in the oil/gas industry.
-The majority of people get an office. After seeing many different companies this is not very common...most other companies have lots of cubical for certain positions but not at Oxy.
-Occidental hires high quality employees so it is nice working with people that are driven and know what they are talking about. This includes hiring experienced workers and also college graduates from many different universities. Usually companies stick to one or two universities to recruit at but its obvious they recruit at many universities to find the best potential future employee. 
-Not in downtown. Location of the Houston office is great. Food available in the plaza level for lunch (not free but convenient)
","-Lots of changes in every area. Occidental rewards workers that make their positions more efficient but at the same time its hard for workers to do that when they are in a new position all the time. Some people end up happy with the change since they get a better position...others are not so lucky. This doesn't really help employee moral. Regular employees are constantly questioning management about most major decisions. I guess thats how it is at most companies but its seen here quite a bit.
-Vacation and time off isnt great. Its not a reason not to work here but its a con. Also, gym memberships are not paid for by the company like most others that are similar. 
-Most open positions are not listed online. Like most companies, it helps to know someone. Not always the best idea. Occidental could probably hire some highly qualified people if they would just post more positions that are open. 
-Quite a few people have been fired recently. I'm not saying it wasnt for good reason but it has definitely made everyone nervous. I don't think fear is such a great motivator so hopefully this doesnt become the norm because I think more and more people will be looking for other jobs if it does.

","Company offers no technical career path, although they claim it's there. This is a production oriented company. If you value engineering design, new technology, etc, this may not be the company for you. If you like to run a plant, could be a great company. Also, the ""do more with less"" mentality can be exhausting. Company also wants mobility in its employees. If you arent willing to move, you may be stuck in your position or looked over for promotions.
