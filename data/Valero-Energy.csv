","Lack of development with no career path. Some managers don’t set measurable goals so at the end of the year, most are left wondering how they are ever considered for promotions besides sitting in the same position for the amount of years required before moving up...

Advice to Management
Trim the fat and actually care about your hardworking employees... So many people just show up to work everyday and they don't care about doing a good job. They are just “putting in the time” before getting their next promotion. Bad managers are never removed or demoted. Leadership doesn’t care to ask employees how their direct manager/supervisor is doing... It’s mind boggling how bosses ever receive effective coaching to become better when leadership has no clue.

I’ve heard better things about other departments, but the operations accounting department is behind the curve.
","Accounting department is set up in a discouraging way. You have to have 3 years of experience before you’re qualified for a promotion. There is absolutely no opportunity to learn or advance until your timeline matches their requirement. Unfortunately they would rather have you sit in your cube bored than teach you a new duty to take stress off your team. This is discouraging for people in their second year because you feel like you can take on more, bit still have 1+ years before you’re “allowed.” This just makes us lose motivation.
Advice to Management
Base promotions on abilities and willingness, not a timeline. You are going to lose intelligent people that want to learn more and get ahead.

","Long hours, high stress with little recognition UNLESS you are a female under 35 and play politics, or a male under 35 who plays politics. YOUR PERFORMANCE DOES NOT MATTER. Younger or connected employees gain advancement with mediocre skills and poor work ethic. Go ahead, stay on your phone all day watching movies, let your terminals run out or leave for vacation while your refinery goes into containment... it's okay! Your older counterparts will fix your mess and YOU will be rewarded. Women are paid SIGNIFICANTLY less than their male counterparts no matter their education, experience, work ethic or performance. If you give your 2 week notice and are a woman, you will be let go immediately and benefits ended the same day (not a one time occurrence but a significant pattern). If you are a male and going to work FOR A COMPETITOR, they will let you stay through your 2 week notice even though you are in a highly sensitive roll (again, a pattern). I used to be an incredibly proud employee, but now hear daily horror stories of older employees being drummed out (they will continue to pile work on you until you are forced to resign or have a stroke), or will let you train and be a doormat for straight out of college young people. They do not give new (including college graduates) or transitioning employees the proper foundation to ensure their success. In the past, we had clear stepping stones and career paths to ensure employee growth and success. New management says that never existed and are doing an incredibly poor job creating their own ""path"" which is proving to be a massive failure. Valero's reputation has taken a significant hit throughout the industry and the low morale is widely known.

Advice to Management
Do something to mediate the problem when someone feels threatened by a co-
worker. When someone says they are being stalked all the time, gets called deragatory names, feels scared for their life because the co-worker is so sporadic and nuts, and tells you this guy tried to run them over with a golf cart, TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

Annual merit increases are barely covering the cost of living increases. Employees who perform very well should get raises above the norm. Remember the old saying : Employees are our #1 asset.....doesn't seem like this is true anymore.

Pros:

A ton of learning opportunities for a young engineer

Knowledgeable resources both locally and at a corporate level for support
","Blatant favoritism towards some employees that wasn't based on performance or manner in which work was accomplished

Questionable business ethics regarding contractors, job bids, and environmental reporting

Tue Feb 09 2016,Anonymous,"Welcome, MN",Current Employee ,Valero Welcome Renewable Plant,8,"The Valero Energy group provides good benefits and pay for their employees and if you are a member of an elite group of backside kissers you get paid even better than deserved.
","I cannot speak for the relationship between management and employees at other facilities, but I can give my perspective of the Welcome, MN facility.

At this facility you will find some really good people, some really good friends and a career that you may want to take pride in. The good people and hard workers are unfortunately; leaving or are being blackballed out of a job at this facility. I believe it has everything to do with taking pride in your work. Those people that you can count on, that take pride in their work and would ultimately just like to put in an honest day’s work to earn a living, plain and simply aren't being appreciated. There is a good deal of favoritism shown to people that are truly lazy or just have poor work ethics because they know how to ""schmooze"" or kiss hindquarters. Alternatively, those people that show up every day on time and try to do their best seem to get no recognition at all. This has lead the Welcome facility to a point where a large number of the experienced staff are looking to move on or are being forced to move on; as they question management or are tired of being treated poorly by management because they know more about the position they hold than management themselves. They have tried and tried to move up based on merits, but this doesn’t work as the “schmoozers” are really good at being ‘Yes Men’ and not thinking for themselves. The hard working employees have tried to make improvements to the everyday work life only to have it all demolished by those that really do not care or by poor choices made by management for which they never take credit. I have witnessed such things as a member of management making changes which produced wasted product and then they knowingly let someone else take the blame for the mistake. I have witnessed certain managers turn his/her cheek on a safety issue that he/she was involved in, but others are fired for much smaller issues by comparison.
Although most people would choose to do right by the community and donate to a good cause; you will be forced to donate to the United Way and also to volunteer a certain number of hours the Valero only approved events each year. You will be badgered by the administration until you do both of these things and if you make the decision not to do either of these things your raise and bonus are threatened.

Suffice it to say that I could go on and on about these issues, but I won't. Just keep an eye open for all of the job postings that come open over and over again and again. The amount of turnover should speak for itself.

I wouldn’t not recommend applying for a job at this facility unless you have absolutely nothing in your background check and if you are the type of individual who would have nothing in your background check; you’re too good to work here and will grow frustrated very quickly because of the things I’ve mentioned above. If you do decide to apply for a position at this facility; keep in mind that if you are the sort of individual that likes to take ownership or pride in his/her work, you will be sorely disappointed here as I see no improvements being made at this facility with local or corporate management.
Advice to Management
I pretty much summed things up in the cons section of this review and hope that people read through this and keep this all in mind as employees leave this facility because of the local and corporate management.

Health and fitness is part of Valero culture. It's implicitly understood that all the employees will be out for a workout during lunch hours. Post lunch meetings are usually scheduled keeping this in mind.
It offers great work life balance.
It has relaxed the dressing code in recent years. 
The IT team is of a medium size. Almost everyone is busy with one project after another. Valero is a big SAP client. It leverages a lot out from SAP. There is lot of interesting work, but it does have some mundane stuff that needs to be taken care of as well.
Valero is a safe company to work with. Its business model is conservative and mitigates risk. Moreover it is the industry leader in the refining field. It does not lay off employees.
","Valero is a conservative company. They offer very less vacation time. Work hours flexibility is less. Work-from-home option is not available. 
The pay (salary and benefits) may not seem attractive if compared to an IT organization.

Wed May 21 2014, Assistant Manager,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Not a great place to work.,2,"Within 2 weeks of being hired, I began training for the Assistant Manager position. Since the store I was at already had an assistant manager, the manager would train me on his duties, as well. I loved it! There were no positions available for AM in any store near us, so I stayed as CSR, got better raises because of doing AM and SM tasks.
","Once I was relocated, I worked with one manager for a few months before he quit. It was unexpected. I was now ""Acting Manager"" for this store. I was fine with that, because it got me more experience. Once they hired a new manager, he quit, unexpectedly, after a few months. I talked to the Area Manager about training me to be a Manager for this store. He humored me for a bit. Then, the last SM came in. I ran the store for about 7 months total. When she ran the store, she started upsetting our regulars because she wasn't ordering correctly. I had worked with her multiple times trying to explain what our customers like. She told me ""I was brought in here to make this store better, because the girl running it couldn't cut it, so I'm going to do this my way."" That was a direct attack at me. They only pay $7.35 when you are hired, and every 3 months you get a review done. The pay raises were: $0.05 for unsatisfactory (which required another review after 30 days. If it was still the same, you were let go), $0.10 for satisfactory, and $0.25 for above satisfactory (which was not to be given out unless you were doing what I did, which is be an AM without the AM pay and benefits). Once I did finally get my AM title, I got a $0.51 raise. Woo....$8.76 to be an assistant manager to a manager that refused to respond to employee's urgent calls, and refused to respond on the 2 occasions our store was broken into. I had to go up there, instead. I wouldn't have minded, but the whole time we are there, we have to be on the clock. Well, that put me into overtime, so I got yelled at for it. I got yelled at because the manager couldn't do her job, so I had to. Then, after finally getting that store in some sort of order, talking to customers and letting them know we were going through a change, basically begging them not to stop shopping with us, and doing everything I could to keep are customer base up; I get accused of stealing. I told them I was not stealing and I asked them to put a camera out where the theft was happening, so they could clear me, and they said it would cost too much. They refused to look at the fact that the theft began as soon as our new manager came in, and just kept saying I did it. For weeks, I fought with them on this. I finally gave up one day, though. I was having constant panic attacks before I worked here, but with everything they were saying about me and the fact that they wouldn't listen to me, it just made everything worse. I finally just walked in and tossed my keys over the counter and let the manager know I wouldn't be returning. I figure, there's no more room for advancement for me here. They think I'm a thief, and even though, I've done everything possible to show them that it wasn't me, they refused to look at anyone else.

I have been working at Valero Energy full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Best overall benefit package I've ever had. Includes options for long-term care insurance, catastrophic illness benefits, legal plan, vision plan, retirement (7% company 401k match with 100% vesting in 5 years) and defined-benefit pension including retiree health benefit contribution, and superior medical/dental coverage (equivalent of platinum Obamacare coverage).

Great schedule.

Annual raises on schedule--even through worst recession years and a period of company unprofitability.

Company is very community-minded, encourages volunteer work and big United Way supporter, as well as favored local charities in each specific location.

Comprehensive training and development plans. Promote from within policies. Clear career paths for advancement for those in management, operations, or engineers.

Extremely strong commitment to worker/workplace safety across the board in a dangerous industry.

Annual bonuses tied to overall company performance (ranging from 50% to 200% of one month's salary).
Cons
Very conservative company dominated by Texas-based headquarters.

Many highly repetitive, low challenge jobs.

Little to no opportunity for advancement if not in management, operations, engineering or retail (but that covers most of the company).

Very bureaucratic/authoritarian corporate culture.

Many jobs are on 12-hour shifts with mandatory graveyard shifts regularly.

Very male-dominated corporate culture, with a very skewed ratio of male to female employees in operations, engineering, and management. Good environment for racial minorities; neutral to negative environment for women and LGBT employees.
Advice to Management
Make concerted effort to dial-back bureaucratic/authoritiarian culture and do more to promote diversity. Do more to create a positive, supportive environment for women and LGBT employees. HR communication should be better, especially be more honest and transparent when cutting retirement/benefit package to control corporate costs which has been very significant last two years.

Wed Aug 15 2012, Customer Service Representative,,Current Employee ,Valero will run you into the ground and then call you to work another shift.,3,"After 9 years with this company I have SOME job security. If you can get into management the benefits are decent.
","Hours vary wildly, I will work 25 hours one week and 50 hours the next. I am often called in on my days off and told that I ""have to"" take a shift. This will happen so frequently that I end up working two weeks in a row with no days off at all. I have regular days off scheduled but i will am often called in every day off for weeks in a row. I have given up trying to spend time with my friends and family at this point, having had to cancel on them numerous times.

The ""Benefits"" at the CSR level consist of paying $120-ish dollars per paycheck for a ""health plan"". I placed that in quotes because it only allows you to see certain doctors (not unusual, but there is one within an hour of my home) and even then they only reimburse you a percentage of what you spent, so you had better have all that money up front and be willing to wait to get it back. The benefits for management are much better. But good luck getting into management.

I am on my feet for 8-11 hours every day. Lots of lifting and carrying. I often go home at the end of a shift and sink into the couch unable to get up. Work is one person to a shift so any eating, smoking, bathroom breaks etc have to be worked in around seeing aprox 220 customers in the store. Not counting the people who come in for things other than purchases. 

If you are a reliable employee this company will absolutely run you into the ground. I have had days that i am the ONLY employee working other then the manager, that's 18 hours. Prove you're reliable and they will literally work you to death. Also you may find yourself to ""indispensable"" to promote. 

Starting pay is minimum wage. You are simply not paid enough to give up your whole life, be on call and devote all your time to work.

Customers are often abusive, be prepared to smile and take it. 

I have had several emergency situations at my store when i have not been able to get ahold of anyone above me. Not my manager, Not my area manager. No one. Leaving me in the store to handle things alone. 

Valero prides itself on its charitable work. What they don't say is that every employee is required to donate out of their paycheck. At one point i was in a particularly tight financial spot at home and tried to opt out of having a United Way donation deducted out of every paycheck, I had a Zone Manager tell me that ""Valero believes in charitable giving. If you don't then perhaps you should go find a company with values more like yours."" I was handed my blue United Way card back and told that I was required to give at least a ""care share"" out of every paycheck. Apparently feeding my family is less important than maintaining the companies reputation.
Advice to Management
The pay is terrible for what we are expected to do at the store level. The reason that there is high employee turnover is 1) good people get so burned out that they end up in the hospital or having to resign and 2) the starting wage is so bad that the only people who will take it are 18 year old high school dropout drug addicts. Want good people and happy employees? offer them a decent wage and a work environment that allows them to spend time with friends and family.

While I have a lot of respect for our management team, it is disheartening to come to work every day and see their new Mercedes or Ferrari's parked in executive parking because of the success of the last few years, while the real incomes of non-management have been shrinking (due to inflation). It is especially ironic considering inflation is being driving by the same thing that has been providing us with record revenues and profits: energy prices.

Career development is a new concept at Valero, unless you are in the executive development program, which is a detailed and extensive program. If you are just a working class professional, your development options are limited to ""core competency"" courses stressing objectives that offer very little value to developing ones career or learning new skills.

Not surprisingly, there has been an exodus of a large number of young, smart and hard working individuals to other companies. This is because Valero's assets grew a lot faster than its ability to develop and recognize people. There is no uniform career path progression, so you might see an extremely talented individual who offers a lot to the organization in terms of shareholder value be stuck in the same position for years, meanwhile a less-talented person gets promoted through the ranks simply because talent management is severely lacking.
