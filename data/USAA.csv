","New Management throughout the organization is worrisome.

If you speak up no one pays heed. Executive management intimidate others and these are acceptable behaviors. Never seen a more chaotic organization in my life. If you want to do the right thing, you will not survive here for more than a couple of years.
Advice to Management
Don't think about of how to progress your career, do the right thing. Critical challenge means hearing the other party. Not telling your subordinates not to question. Keep the culture of the organization not slides on mission. When you ask people to speak up, please mean it. Stop back stabbing it will only get good people out in no time. The new people are destroying the culture. Most of executive management will not even meet a level below direct reports.

Advice to Management
Hard to know where to start. Usaa is like a cult. They treat you all nice and say its about serving those who've served, but then quickly throw you into the fire as a sacrifice.

Training is a joke. 3 months of talking good about benefits and co, but no real practice with systems or actual job duties. You're expected to gain the knowledge on the fly.

Managment can start pulling there heads out of the sand and realize numbers don't equal talent. 3/4 weeks in a month, management would say all is well. Come week 4 when numbers come out, oh your not doing well enough. Not one critique in between that time. This is with getting compliments from customers who say ""you could do better than USAA.""

If you have a disability, they will drag their feet. They will lose paperwork, require you to prove your disability, mismanage accommodations in hopes you'll leave, they will actively set you up to fail, constant IT issues, constant changes that makes your job harder and customers angrier. Then when you request accommodations, hr will lie as much as possible so they can deny your request. Even with multiple doctors and life long paperwork being given.

4/5 days in the week you're cleaning up someone else's mess. They will expand your roll without asking. Doesn't sound bad until I describe you are responsible for knowledge of all 50 states, you get approximately an hour a day to make calls out, you have 150 claims assigned to you, and you take random calls on other adjusters claims. They wished for us to take over total loss on top of this. They gave a very poor 3 day course and yet again threw you into the fire. 80% of your day is taking in random claims calls. The remaining 20% is for you to reach out. Their slogan at one point was ""we go above and beyond for those who've done so."" How is an hour a day to reach out to assigned customer going above and beyond? Not to mention being one of the higher costing insurance out there, you'd think you'd get more bang for your buck.

The sad truth is, they have talent they are losing left and right for the all mighty dollar. Management is more than willing though to do this.

Lots of places to eat or have coffee. It's large organization, so it really depends on the group you work with and you management. Plenty of work to do. The main San Antonio campus building (5 connecting buildings) is beautiful and full of military and historical museum pieces.
","Too much of the work is fixing things or ""cleaning up"" because they didn't pass an audit or meet a requirement. USAA is definitely not badge-blind: contractors are second-class citizens; often left out of meetings (even little stuff like a group pizza lunch), which can effect work, and sometimes bullied. Contractors also have separate (further away) parking, and none of the perks like discounts or using the gym. Buildings are large with long walks, and in the main building there is handicapped parking but no handicapped entrance.
Advice to Management
Listen to the little people who say that there is a compliance/regulation issue so a year later the work doesn't need to be redone. Don't treat your contractors as lessor beings, and take bullying more seriously.

","This company from day one was a complete disaster. When I got hired I was told I would be in Insurance with Saturday and Sundays off to walk in and be working for banking and I did not agree to that but stuck with it bc I wanted to work for the company. To continue my training was all out dated videos and of course that made the job even harder. I got put on a team with 18 people who started with me and within a year we were left with 4 people bc the a manger that we had was very very aggressive and would harass us every single day making the job unbearable to work for. I went up the chain of command to see if I could maybe be changed teams to be told I need to work things out with my current manager (supervisor). I ended up in counseling and on anxiety meds bc of the job and my manager. This place will drive you absolutely insane. I have worked in other call centers and have never in my life experienced any of these problems in the past. I do not recommend anyone to work for this place at all

Sun Oct 11 2020, Senior IT Systems Analyst,"San Antonio, TX",Current Employee ,Good to the Certain Extent,0,"If you manage to get into USAA, you will have a sense of security, unless the CEO and the Board decide to sell off more parts of the company.

In certain areas of the company you will have the opportunity to learn and grow, and be put in positions to showcase your abilities or potential.

Benefits are decent, although they have dramatically declined over the past 2 years.

Education benefits are a plus, if you want to earn your first or additional degree.
","In the past five years at the company, it has dramatically declined since I joined the company. What attracted me to the company was its history of having shared military values, and knowing what it meant to serve. Upon retiring from the military, this was a rare characteristic in any company, and gravitated to USAA due this reason. 

Since the time Stewart Parker took over as CEO, the company declined in almost every facet. And continues to part ways from its former self under Wayne Peacock. 

With Stewart Parker pushing to make USAA Federal Savings Bank categorized as a Big Bank, it put the entire collection of companies that make up USAA at risk, and it came to fruition when the CFPB’s fine, and the OCC’s consent order. He essentially tried to sell a house without it being built, and got dinged on being out of compliance for a bank of its size class. With that USAA has engaged in correcting those gaps and deficiencies, but took a strange approach to it. They started to actively seek out executives and individual contributors from companies that have egregious violations in the banking industry, and place them in the 2nd and 3rd lines of defense areas (Risk, Compliance, and Audit). This has put USAA in a circle of on-going and repetitive activities that have no end-state, all in the sake of compliance. Thus increasing the work load, and decreasing work-life balance and productivity.

USAA also pays 5-10% below industry levels at on all positions, and they mislead people in adding in a “bonus” in their total compensation package, implying they will make a certain amount in a year that is false. Now that the bonus is no longer a sure thing, especially if you do not complete your online training, the likelihood of you completing the online training due to the largely increased workload has decreased, putting that bonus in jeopardy.

Lastly, the company as I mentioned moved away or has completely severed its once foundational cultural attraction, in that it had started military values and knows what it means to serve. It went from that once great company to being a politically left leaning company trying to hard to be like a Silicon Valley tech company. The company alienates a great majority of the employee population who are there to serve the military community and their families, by pushing far left identify politics down the throats of employees. With the current CEO he has began to openly take political sides on the companies behalf both internally and externally on left leaning media outlets. Employees are now being forced to endure leftist indoctrination apart of company training, and its mandatory. So you will get to learn how much America is bad and systemically racist, and how you need to do better because you have implicit bias.

In the end, if you go to work to work this place may no longer be for you. If you are okay with false narratives being shoved down your throat then you may like this place.

If you do not care about work life balance, and don't mind the expectation of you working 16 hours a day and on the weekends, and doing it for a salary 5-10% below the industry standard then you may like this place.
Advice to Management
Clearly define your objectives, and do not hold employees accountable for your failures to define objectives and a clear vision. Rebuild the once sought after culture of USAA with individuals with military backgrounds to reset the culture back to a company with “shared military values” and to “know what it means to serve”. Only those who have served can lead that charge, and I believe that was the intent of the 25 Army Officers who founded USAA.

Advice to Management
Allow more executive authority to offering solutions to members without having to wait for the member to express their concern. As sales professionals, we should still be able to offer solutions and be the professional leading the conversation. There is a way to maintain compliance while educating the members on options available to them outside of the reason they called.

","The company is very numbers driven. Sometimes I felt like another number due to the stress that came with the job position. I constantly spoke with insureds who yell and cuss at me all day. Constantly heard others crying in the bathroom due to the stress. Prior/current military insureds speak down on you due to their position in the military. No room to move up due to the large amount of customer service representatives and limited positions in other departments. The company seems to be tenureship driven, meaning they only promote you if you've been in the same position for over 10 years. If you are on the phones answering calls, you are treated like the bottom of the barrel when it comes to company priorities. Also finding out that some colleagues were being paid more than me with little to no experience while I was not able to negotiate pay during the hiring process was also a turn-off.

2) Plano office looks new and modern, very nice facility.
3) There are some really nice people who you would enjoy working with.
","My comments below are relevant to USAA IT only - I have worked here for 15 months;

1) Outdated and proprietary technology tools and frameworks which are built in-house and impose a steep learning curve on new employees.
2) A lot of technically incompetent people who lack sound architectural and design skills to analyze the problem 
in a big-picture context which almost always leads to unreliable software and frequent outages in Production.
3) The ROI for most of the IT projects is horrible - they spend way too much money for what they get in return.
4) For key tools and enterprise software, they rely heavily on IBM which is no longer known for building great software products - rest of the world has moved on from IBM.
5) Very risk-averse and slow to adapt, risks should not be taken just for the sake of it, 
but taking no-risks is actually much worse than taking calculated risks.
6) Lack of strong and visionary technical leadership at the top.
7) Some employees who behave like kids - complain about very petty things to managers.
8) False and baseless sense of pride - most of the employees have no idea how BETTER looks like, 
so they think they are the best and with that mindset, you will never get better or learn from others.
9) Strong anti-California/Silicon Valley sentiment - every company can learn from Silicon Valley companies about being innovative, 
building great work-cultures, and managing risks smartly.
10) Not open to new ideas, suggestions, and constructive criticism - criticism almost always results in a negative performance review.
11) Their base pay is low.
12) 401K benefits vest only after 2 years of employment.

It is very disheartening to see college-hires starting out their careers here.
Finally, if you have a choice, please consider the alternatives more seriously. This is a software engineering practice at it's worst.

","Unfortunately the reputation that USAA has for internal growth opportunity is false. As an internal employee, HR is left out of any internal interviews (I've been through many interviews, I know this from experience), giving hiring managers full reign over who to hire. The chosen candidates are almost always friends & family of managers in that particular department. Although some managers are great, others aren't qualified and only received a promotion because of nepotism. If the company would allow HR back into the internal hiring process, USAA wouldn't be losing so many valuable employees.
Advice to Management
HR needs to be a part of the internal hiring process. Stop letting hiring managers choose their friends and family over candidates that are more than qualified for these positions. 

Change starts from the top. If you continue to allow under-qualified candidates to promote, frontline associates don't get the training and guidance needed (RS's and Team Managers who have no clue how to coach or lead), members are therefor left with a lackluster experience and seek products and services elsewhere. Compliance is a major focus within the enterprise, the lack of courageous leadership within the frontline management team is an unfortunate downfall when it comes to regulations and guidelines. If management is only there because they ""wanted to get off the phones"" and they do not truly care about the enterprise, how can you expect their subordinates to care? 

If USAA really cares about its members the way they should, invoking change to the internal hiring process is the FIRST step to ensuring a compliant company and protect its members.

Mon Mar 23 2020, Mortgage Loan Officer,"Brandon, FL",Former Employee ,Stay Away from Mortgage if you can,6,"8% 401k match is the best I have seen anywhere.
","So I guess we can start with pay. Their base salary is lower then what you can get else where, also the bonus you get per funded loan is lower then anyone else I have spoken to. They had a system where if you hit certain numbers for so many months in a row you would get a promotion and earn a higher base salary, they tweaked the numbers around a few times, till they eventually got rid of it. Bonus structure has been changed so many times since I’ve been here no one including management really know if we are being compensated correctly. About 6 months ago they messed up everyone’s payout and over paid some and under paid others and we just had to take their word for it, because no one knows if they reported numbers are correct. The systems are the absolute worst!!! I have spent full 8 hour days sitting there telling people I can’t originate their loans because our systems is down. Management is just as bad. Upper management from CEO (out of nowhere chooses to retire), mortgage presidents (one fired, one quick after a year), VPs and Directors (quitting, fired, moving to totally different departments) all have no vision for this department. Direct managers many of them never do our job a day in their lives, but have the never to belittle you and tell you they couldn’t do our job in the same sentence. The training is the WORST experience I had ever had in my life. My entire class spent 3+ months completely stressed out with a trainer who had no clue What she was doing. She sat on her desk and looked at us for over an hour because someone asked her how interest rates work so we can explain to members when they had questions. She had no idea how they worked herself let alone a class of 15 people who never worked in mortgage before. Every week they pick a hot button issue that most of the time means very little in the grand scheme of things, but they get on your case no stop. Sometimes asking you to stop doing what makes us money just to make someone feel good about a report you were on. Just for following week they could care less about that issue and bug you with a whole new one. They want you to be stuck on the phones for forever!!! They literally were telling managers in other departments not to interview us, because they “need” us. Working Saturdays and nights is brutal! Best thing to do, is ask anyone who works in any department in mortgage would they get a home loan through USAA.

","Very traditional and silo'd structure. Heavy command-and-control culture. The people who do best wear dress clothes to work and have clipper-cut hair. Bonus is decent, but it's not guaranteed. Annual raises are between 1-3% usually. Pressure to show-up early and stay late. 

Financial products offered to members is shrinking rapidly due to their ineffectiveness in competing with other financial services companies. They used to have a financial advisory, but that's been sold. They used to have an investment company, but that's been sold. They used to offer a ""car buying"" service to members, but that has been discontinued. They used to offer ""Trust services"" for members, but that, too, has been offloaded. Basically, they offer life insurance, property & casualty insurance, and a bank now. Their products are good, but their prices are usually cost-prohibitive for most of the people they serve.

USAA's hiring and employment practices discriminate in favor of women (60%). They purposefully recruit certain so-called ""under-represented"" segments demographically, form a pool of candidates from that cadre, and then select from that pool--excluding men. The executive and middle management layers of their Human Resources organization is comprised of 82.7% women and/or minorities. Yet, they incessantly plead, broadcast, advertise, and consistently brainwash employees on the unproven merits of ""diversity and inclusion."" Their Communications organization is also 75% women and/or minority. Their Marketing, Legal, Finance, and Strategy groups are 68%+ women and/or minority.

Culture within the org is heavy-duty bureaucracy. There are layers upon layers upon layers within disparate organizational silos--most of which do not know what, or have visibility of, is going-on in other similar functions. There is a centralized ""Change Management"" organization as well that apparently employs the ADKAR model, yet also adheres to and promotes the ACMP methodology--these two models are not the same, and are often competing/conflicting. There is a MASSIVE ""Compliance"" effort underway now for 2+ years as well. This is consuming hundreds of millions of dollars and is ALL expense for the organization. There is little, if any, true process mindset at USAA as well. They used to have a pseudo-centralized ""CI Office"" which adopted the long-defunct six sigma method. This flamed-out quickly (as was expected and warned against). Now they have begun employing an image of a picture of a reproduced version of a chicken-wire/duct-tape facsimile of Business Process Management. This, too, will flame-out and die an ignominious death as soon as the new CEO sees its faultiness. 

To summarize, USAA is a bloated, fat-laden, military-culture, insurance-industrial-complex organization that better start moving in the right direction--and very soon. The 13+ million members who are keeping it afloat have more information on pricing and product offerings than ever before, are educating themselves thereabout, and are (or will) jumping ship faster than they can be replaced.

Thu Mar 05 2020, Senior Insurance Professional,"Tampa, FL",Former Employee ,Decent Place to Work,2,"USAA, for an entry level person, does provide opportunities commensurate with such a position. Benefits are great for those that need them. Training is great as one will be licensed in all 50 states.
","Being successful in P&C requires focus on metrics. The job has gone away from the membership focus and has focused on the bottom line and numbers. Monetarily this is a good entry level position and if you perform well you can promote quickly. The con to this is that there are many talented people in line for those leadership and higher paying jobs, so one will eventually stagnate. Cross leveling is political and very subjective to hiring managers who have been with the company a long time. I would describe the ""good old boy system"" . USAA has placed a huge focus on diversity and inclusion. What was seen many times was a focus on the ""diversity and inclusion"" versus talent. Get ready to be in a high stress position! Managers will support you, but they are overworked as well. Get ready for politics because it happens. One needs to be able to “brand” oneself.

You're expected to take care of account follow up between back to back calls, you’ve got to convince the members to stay with the company even if our premiums are far higher than our competitors, they'll say they want feedback but it is lip service so they can say they stand for one thing but will not follow up and fix systems or processes unless profitable for them. Systems will go down and information will not be available to perform your job and you’ll still be held accountable.

","Pay is low, medical benefits are not great, coworkers lack of critical thinking skills causes issues, lack of qualified employee pool for this pay level job, lots of calls, hard to get promoted if you are younger.

","Horrible direct managers in call center areas of USAA. Can have 1 good manager, and then a terrible manager that will only care about numbers and metrics. Pushy sales tactics are taught to employees in this department in order to meet metrics. If you have a higher moral standard and respect for Military and want to really help them when offering insurance policies they can afford management will ask why you did not write the policy that was 600.00 more than what they already have? Why did you not get them to say yes to the bank account (even though banking was not a good solution for that particular individual) I always had good numbers but it was more because I was ethical and do not lie to potential members. In the almost 6 years of working here I witnessed colleagues use bait and switch tactics, writing policies the customer was unaware were issued, and bank accounts opened and offered as free bank accounts just open accounts and policies to meet metrics for the department. Not much room for advancement in this department, had colleagues with masters degrees that had been in the same position on the phone for 10 years. To advance to a higher position in this department it’s more who you know because not many spots open up. Before becoming a work at home employee would see colleagues in weekly coaching in tears. Managers will tear you down and make you feel worthless in the call center side of USAA. If you can handle the stress of thinking you are going to lose your job everyday and an incredibly mismanaged department be my guest and work here. I have been a member of USAA for 14 years I can say after seeing from the inside of what goes on and company practices I am not as proud to say I am a Member of USAA. Do not ever file an employee relations complaint against a manger even if it is warranted, the no retaliation policy does not exist.
Advice to Management
Managers need a training in EQ (Emotional IQ). Call center areas need to be evaluated by an Industrial/Organizational Psychologist expert to identify what changes are needed to have happier employees. Employees that work in the call center areas are the Front Line of USAA and work hard. In what I witnessed in my time here most are unhappy and only stay because of the bonus and benefits provided. All Work at Home coaching with Managers need to be recorded as coaching was done over the phone where unprofessional and inappropriate comments are said more than would have been in the office. Managers in call center areas need to support the career goals of the employees on their team and guide them to what they need to do to get there. Managers also need to follow their job duties which include weekly coaching of employees on their team (weekly coaching is not done), follow the correct required steps of the quarterly review discussion processes that are clearly laid out in their job duties. Happier employees are less likely to call in and perform better than counterparts that are unhappy and feel stuck in their position and feel completely unappreciated by their Managers. Identifying the changes that need to be made with the direct managers in the call center area will improve efficiency as well. I know this review will never be looked at by management, but changes need to happen in the organizational structure of the call center areas.

","Lots of Cons:

1. Below Market Pay. USAA pays well below the market for most positions and gives very few and minimal raises. They will tell you the bonus is high but it has gone down over the past 5 years and now is no longer competitive with other companies. 

2. Horrible Company Culture. The CEO and other top executives have fostered a nasty, political, backstabbing environment. They have also completely forgotten the Mission is the company and made decisions that do not look to their best interests.

3. Worst CEO and Senior Executives in a Fortune 100 Company. Stuart Parker might be the worst CEO to ever lead a Fortune 100 company. His decisions are not well thought out, do not have the best interests of the members in mind, self-centered, and are driving the company out of business. USAA P&C and Bank haven’t been profitable in years.

4. Dysfunctional Legal Department. The executives in the Legal Department are extremely poor managers and narcissistic. They also hire way too many attorneys from the Financial Regulators - every good attorney knows that good/smart attorneys don’t work for the regulators. 

5, Good Employees are leaving in droves. Because I’d the above most of the good/talented employees are leaving the company. What are remaining are the dumb, lazy, and narcissistic left overs.

I was an AIII with USAA for four years and yesterday was my last day with the company. Basically the job entails you staying ""open"" and taking random status calls on other employees claims for 70% of the day leaving you 30% to work your own claims. The calls are back to back and never slowed down over the time I was employed. USAA then made the decision to merge the total loss department with non-injury, with no pay increase and minimal training, which is why I left. We already did not have enough time to do our jobs as it was and then they dumped a whole other department on us. The pay is not competitive but I will say the benefits are not bad. It's a shame as USAA does hire a lot of good employees but there is such a disconnect between upper level management and front facing member service representatives. I was not even given the courtesy of an exit interview after 4 years of service. This speaks volumes from management as they do not want to hear what we have to say which is why so many employees are leaving. My advice to anyone considering USAA is to put in your two years to get the 401K match and then leave as upper level management has created a toxic environment and minimal to no room for advancement.

The executive management group are either people who have been with the company for 20 + years or rejects from bigger firms. The executives truly think they are better than the average employee. USAA uses Orwellian type language to create an internal class structure. If you work on the phone you are what is known as an MSR (Member service representative) doesn’t matter if you have a CFP and a MBA you are a MSR in their eyes. But then again you really are not a financial advisor, more like an annuity and life insurance salesman. USAA prides itself in what is known as the traditional approach to retirement, and what that means is that everyone gets fixed annuity with rates lower than 1.50%, doesn’t matter if you are 30 or 70 everyone needs an annuity. Honestly 8 can’t understand why FINRA hasn’t busted USAA on all of their crooked annuity deals. Compliance is a nightmare, the CEO has the whole company on becoming more compliant (BCC) reason being is because USAA had never been compliant in the past. Google USAA and recent lawsuits. I could say so much more but what is the point, this place is trash.
Advice to Management
Fire yourselves. Also stop acting like social justice warriors. It’s obviously a front. If USAA really cared about diversity wouldn’t there be more minorities and women in upper management? My old manager used to refer to all of the executive leadership as “clones” reason being they were mostly middle aged generic white guys. Also USAA has weak uncompetitive generic products, ie USAA customers are paying too much, go to Geico/BofA/TD and so on

","Some managers (Not to be named here) said that they cared for the military and their families. That was a lie to be blunt. When I was going through hard times in my marriage and missing days here and there my manager told me if I missed another day that I'd be put on restriction. My wife gave me the news that she wanted a divorce and I was devastated, I was not in any way fit for work or to talk to members. Well that manager put me on restriction anyways, didn't listen to me or what I had to say about what was going on. I had the best sales on the team at the time and worked quite a bit of overtime. I had a few disabilities thanks to my service including one being IBS. It sometimes would require elongated bathroom breaks, my manager complained EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. and threatened me with various things because of my severe IBS. She refused to work with me despite being put up by a previous manager as employee of the month multiple times as well as the most recognition in my district by multiple superiors. This manager had it out for me, USAA lost a solid employee because of it.

All the feedback I’ve gotten was that I was well prepared in my answers but lack the necessary experience. Yet these are entry level positions I am applying for, yet I still get chosen to interview even when they see what’s on my resume and what that experience consists of. So why waste my time??? I decided to finally apply elsewhere, within 1 month of searching outside of USAA I landed my dream job. They saw my potential they saw my desire to grow and be challenged, USAA hiring managers only saw what I lacked. 

The call center is a toxic place full of managers who are trying to limit your bathroom usage. Adherence is more important to them than employee moral. Maybe if you didn’t overburden your employees and actively promoted them you’d be able to keep them.

The pay is a slap in the face compared to competitors.

As for the stress....where do I even begin. To say that the property claim adjusters are overworked would be an understatement. I'm not sure how management can sit back and watch their adjusters handle 100+ claims while taking back to back phone calls and being on a strict, non-flexible phone schedule and think ""yep, things are working great here."" And oh my gosh, don't let a call last through your lunch break....say adios to your adherence at that point.

Claim adjusters are quitting left and right because of the mental warfare they have to deal with. The amount of stress and the current state of this department is not worth it...hasn't been for years.

- Work-life balance... I have every weekend off, have yet to work more than 45 hours during any given week (and even then the OT isn't a problem since I'm hourly).
- 401K Program... USAA matches all employee 401K contributions $1 for $1 up to 8% of our income starting our FIRST DAY (unheard of!)
- Affordable & quality health insurance benefits
- PTO is plentiful (32 days during our 1st year at USAA!) and is easy to use once new hire training is complete
- Generous tuition assistance program... The company invests millions of dollars for the professional development of it's employees at all levels
- The Phoenix USAA Campus is beautiful & state-of-the-art on-site amenities (Clinic w/ RN's on staff, Starbucks, fitness center, several cafeterias/cafes, relaxation rooms, tranquil outdoor spaces)
- I get paid very well for what I do
- Turnover is relatively low, so I'm surrounding by highly tenured & talented co-workers that are very helpful to the noobies
- USAA new hire training programs are thorough, extensive, and effectively prepare employees for their daily tasks; my training lasted 4 months!
- Although all new auto adjusters work M-F, 11:00 am - 7:30 pm initially, there are opportunities to ""bid"" for earlier shifts (the earliest being 7:00 am - 3:30 pm); most adjusters get the schedule they want by the end of their first year at the company
","- This is NOT the ideal job for anyone that is not accustomed to working in a fast-paced and stressful environment... Claims adjusters at USAA are always BUSY!
- This is NOT the ideal job for anyone who is accustomed to working ""banker's"" hours or only accustomed to working 40 hours a week. At times we do have to put in a little bit of OT every once in a while. All new auto claims adjusters work 11:00 AM - 7:30 PM Monday thru Friday.
- Because turnover is so low, it can take a while to get promoted to a management position
- The company prefers managers have bachelor's (or even graduate degrees at times) for management positions.

","I had heard from so many people prior to joining USAA that it was an amazing culture and when you join, you never want to leave. I also really bought into the HCD mission at CDO and was stoked to join. The challenges with transforming the tech culture there were real, but expected. I found that the folks I worked with in San Antonio were passionate and mostly delightful to work with. What I wasn’t expecting was the strange culture within the design office. I thought that the spirit of human centered design would be alive and well there. What I found was hierarchy, a lot of process, a lack of support amongst leadership (I don’t even think my boss’s boss knew who I was, much less didn’t seem to have any interest in forming a relationship with me), and some weird fear/territorial/controlling behaviors amongst teams and their leaders. It was unlike any design team I had ever been part of. I felt completely out of my element there and felt relieved when I left. Also, similar to a review above, I wondered why I was hired and sold this role when it turned out that my skills weren’t a good match for what was really needed. 

I’m not one to post a review like this under normal circumstances, but I know that I would have wanted to know this prior to joining.

-Can't really think of anything else to be perfectly honest
","-No opportunity to advance beyond call center role, no matter how great you are at your job.
-No support or opportunity for developing as a professional.
-Mediocre, at best, compensation.
-Every 2 weeks there is some new earth-shattering, impossible change you are expected to be stressed out of your mind about. And then it goes away to make way for the new sky-is-falling change.
-No thinking, reasoning or common sense
-Unrealistic expectations. For at least the last few to several months I worked there no one got promoted, because no one could understand the new ""beyond the numbers"" standard, let alone meet them.
-Barely a scant of recognition if you perform well; but, oh man, if you fail in just one aspect of your job they will hammer you, and probably put you on a plan for 3 months with no monthly bonus. I've known quite a few people who would be top 5% in all catagories performers for the month who were still essentially treated like dirt. One even had their picture taken to go on some kind of brochure promoting the company. Even now they are trying to fire them, even though they are an amazing performer and make the company lots of money. Just beyond comprehension. It really doesn't matter how long you work there or how well you do, they will gladly fire you if given the chance.
-Very cult-like. They always talk about how scary it is ""out there in the real world"" and how lucky you are to work at USAA.
-To compensate for ""not doing layoffs"", they just come up with some other reason to get rid of people

See what it's like and then ask yourself why anyone would put up with that for any length of time.

Thu May 02 2019, Property Claims Adjuster,"Colorado Springs, CO",Current Employee ,USAA is still finding the balance,3,"Benefits are world class: 8% 401k match (100% vested in just 2 years), free onsite gym with steam room, sauna, and showers, onsite clinic, cafeteria, massage therapy, great corporate culture, 2 volunteer days per year, generous PTO, effective training program (they pay for your licensing), tuition benefit of up to $10k per year on just about anything you want to major in, management seems pretty invested in success of employees, breaks go beyond the state guidelines (CO requires 2 paid 10s and an unpaid 30- USAA gives an extra 25 minutes of paid break beyond that). It is hourly instead of salary, so there is the benefit of being paid for any extra time you have to work beyond your scheduled hours. There's also a 30% premium for weekends and evenings, as well as a holiday bonus each year worth an entire paycheck. The TOTAL compensation package is quite generous.
","The entry level adjuster job is kind of a joke. We're more phone operators than anything, and you must remain in this mundane, waste-of-my-talent position for a full year before being allowed to move up or around. There is ZERO file ownership. You can pay the easiest of claims, but if you can't pay on the first call, you have to pass the file on to a higher level adjuster. Tracking phone adherence is a little frustrating, because if I get a call right before a scheduled break and have to take my break later, technically I'm out of adherence for that time until I have a manager go in and adjust it. It should really be more based on the total number of minutes you're supposed to be ""Ready"", not down to the specific minute. Finally, the pay is pretty insulting for the level of talent they hire for these positions. You're basically forced to rely on the company bonus every year to bring you up to industry standards, and there is no way to plan for how much you'll get because it varies every year. ALSO- the hiring schedule felt like it was intended to screw us a little. We were brought on right after the first of the year, which meant we lost out on flex days off that are granted right at the beginning of the year, and though the company advertises benefits with reduced premiums for Healthy Points, employees hired right after the beginning of the year do not get to have their Healthy Points discount until the following year. So I came on thinking I'd be able to score some points for being a fit individual and pay $96 less per month, only to learn I'll be paying full premiums until next year since I wasn't able to earn my points last year.
Advice to Management
Provide a more relaxed avenue for talented entry-level employees to demonstrate their skills and move into the positions for which we are really qualified. The fact that I cannot see myself in this banal entry-level position for a year is causing me to consider leaving the company altogether. Also, employees across the board would rather have a higher base salary every check than have to wait for a bonus each year to bring us up to industry standards. Particularly when employees who joined expecting great things are struggling to make ends meet due to the pay cut on the biweekly check as compared with other companies (an insurance company right across the street starts adjusters at almost $8k more per year, which is a lot more than my bonus would have been this year if I'd gotten one).

Management was ineffective in leading change and success. The company is starting to hire for quotas (diversity, gender, veterans) and not for best-qualified. IT systems are out of date. Leaders are unable to grasp current trends like agile. There are compliance issues. The company is losing smart, talented resources left and right. Compared to the industry, USAA will underpay you. But USAA will tout the benefits you'll receive while at the company. Those benefits shouldn't matter because even with the bonus you will be underpaid compared to the rest of the industry.

Thu Jan 31 2019, Senior User Experience Designer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Design Org - ATX,11,"If you are interested in design advocacy, this is the place for you.
If you are interested in learning how to have hard conversations with business partners, this is the place for you.
If you are interested in establishing process and framework, this is the place for you.
If you are familiar with enterprise struggles and have interest in navigating them, this is the place for you.

If you have no interest designing at scale and coordinating that type of effort, go work somewhere else. 

There are a lot of problems to solve here. Whether it’s product-related, studio culture-related, process-related. If you have the drive, you can influence these things. It just takes more effort to do here than somewhere else. At times, it can feel thankless because of the effort it takes. 

The Austin studio is stacked with respected talent. Being able to work and learn from each other on the daily is amazing. The space itself is really nice and the benefits we get are solid.
","The company has too many verticals that make it difficult to design end-to-end experiences. This results in a lot of ownership issues even within our design org. 
Also areas of the business (amongst others) aren’t qualified for their positions. They don’t have product experience because they have moved their way up in the company starting at a completely unrelated, different role. USAA's currency is relationship building and they want to take care of their people. This unfortunately results in a lot of bloat. Three roles will satisfy just one at another enterprise-scale company. 

While there are a lot of talented people in the Austin studio, there is a lot of laziness and lack of ambition. You don’t have product work to do? Poor you. Some of us are actually really busy. Do something that helps foster studio culture if you're bored. A lot of employees here feel like they were mislead about how far behind the company was in regards to adopting HCD and having a product strategy. This frustration is valid and real. It feels like we are running uphill and being continuously pushed down. 

The pay isn’t as competitive in comparison to other employers in Austin. We apparently get paid the same as designers in San Antonio but the cost of living is higher here.
Advice to Management
You have some really talented people here and there needs to be a solid retention strategy for the Austin location. Allow people to easily move around within the org if people are unhappy. Also, get rid of the bloat and ensure decision makers who effect process have a perspective grounded in industry experience.

Mon Feb 04 2019,N/A,, ,Unfair hiring practices,6,"USAA is a very good company and every employee that I have known is happy working there. The rating and reviews also shows that. However, I am writing this review for the sake of the complaint I am going to mention in the cons section.
","Most of hirings happen thru referrals and candidates evaluation seems unfair and based on favoritism. I was fully qualified for couple of positions and yes my resume is written good enough but got rejected without even a phone interview.
Advice to Management
USAA should practice equal opportunity and mean it. I was a contractor there and made a lot of efforts to contribute to the company. My contributions were also visible to people who worked in the same field and executives in my area. Yet, I am rejected with no interview in the exact same field that if anything, I am just more experienced in it now. I understand that there is always someone better out there but this, sounds to me someone in charge just did not like me.

","Understaffed, overworked, they dangle the annual bonus over your head constantly throughout the year. It's a typical call center environment. The only thing that matters is the bottom dollar and how man referrals you make. Your actual work performance has little to do with your job title. It's all about how much you sell. After 10 years I was given a promotion, my compensation was an additional .40 an hour. It's next to impossible to ""grow"" or move up within this company unless you have a degree.
