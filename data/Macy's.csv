","- Constant reorganizations result in absorption of other responsibilities -- constantly learning new roles but partial automation means they aren't necessarily transferable to other companies

- Less job stability the higher you ascend the ladder; Quite a few of them were let go over the past 2 years. Really a hit to morale

- You won''t feel valued. From the operations staff to your own manager, you will never receive any sort of appreciation. Your manager will also never talk to you about your career goals.
- There is no accountability. I'm beginning to think this is the Macy's way. Operations makes a mistakes, they never own up to it and pin it to support staff. You own manager won't even be accountable for his/her mistakes. They will only take accountability for successes, but never recognize their failures.
Advice to Management
Macy's talks about putting people first, but that is not the case especially during a pandemic. I was furloughed for 3 months. On my return back, they cut 3900 jobs, stripped a number of days away from colleagues based on how long they were furloughed, and withheld raises. After all that though, they gave top executives $9 million is bonuses. Furlough was no vacation for people. Spending 3 months with no communication about how or when I was going back was scary. Then to come back with 2 PTO days stripped away because I was furloughed. That's no way to put colleagues first.

Thu Jan 28 2021, Merchandiser,"Stockton, CA",Former Employee ,It's minimum wage retail,0,"The best part about the job was the coworkers. They made the days go by faster. 

Doing markdowns in Last Act was gross, but if you were lucky you could find some great deals before anyone else. 

They won't really fire anyone, so I never felt pressured to actually meet corporate's unrealistic work timelines.
","They expect you to complete 8 hours of work in only 4 hours, all for the competitive price of minimum wage. If you're lucky, you can get a .13 cent raise after several years of work. If you're part-time, you're lucky if they even give you 12 hours a week. some weeks they offer zero hours. Except during the holidays, that's when you get the joy of working 60 hour weeks. 

My team was a group of young women, and we were the first ones in the building daily at 4 am. One morning we found that a man had passed out in the dressing room before closing and was just wandering around the closed store that morning. It seemed like he was an addict and high on something, and we were terrified, but management instructed us to ignore the strange man and just..continue working. There was no security, and when the HR manager finally showed up with security an hour later, we were all rewarded for our bravery with 10 in Macy's money.

This doesnt include other things that pop up throughout the day, maybe you gotta build some furniture, toss out some fixtures, or organize a stock room, re-stock the floor This led to multiple occasions where employees were asked if they can stay longer, which can be a pro or a con, depending on who you ask.

Being able to collaborate with the members of your department is crucial if you want a great work life. There are plenty of great rewards for when you meet credit and sales goals. The management knows how to have fun and make the job fun. There's a lot of trust within the company, and knowing that management trusts your decision making is a fulfilling and wonderful feeling. The people were great and it was always a different day. My department team always took care of me and had my back, and management was always on a roll. Looking back, realistically, the good outweighed the bad.
","There is a lot of work to be done in regards to cleanliness. Sometimes cleaning fitting rooms, folding tables, recovering the area, etc. could get incredibly overwhelming when you're also tending to customers, but this depends on the department that you work in. Sometimes the credit goals are unrealistic, but they're possible if you feel comfortable bending the rules a little (which sometimes is the only way). The customers could also be overwhelming, but they most always involved coupons. The coupon system is a bit ridiculous, and as a customer service associate, you will unfortunately get the brunt of it. Eventually you learn to apologize, agree that it sucks, and you all typically move on.

Advice to Management
I was hired as the first of a newly created position, so some disorganization was to be expected but Macy's as a whole is run much more haphazardly than I ever expected. The same carts I used to wheel out large amounts of product to stock were the same ones used as extra display tables, causing cart shortages when I needed them. Customers constantly asked for shopping carts, which Macy's no longer supplies. If an item was found out of place after a customer abandoned it (ex: a pillow in the candy section), associates could look up the section it came from (ex: home goods) and still have no idea where in that section it belongs, making it difficult and time consuming to put away. To my understanding, the fulfillment team has similar problems finding items customers requested. There is no map layout or merchandising plan to clear up confusion. The back stock rooms were numerous and rarely corresponded to the section it was near (ex: the store room in the men's winter coat section stores clearance; the store room in the clearance section stores polos). The computers are slow and old and the phones are so old it sounds like the person on the other end is underwater. HR would write work orders to fix problems, such as broken locks or doors, the moment they were requested but maintenance could take weeks to get to it, or even never fix it at all. The phone policy of no cell phone on the floor is unenforceable in some positions. I worked alone under the supervision of the second floor merchandising manager, but neither of us had a Macy's-supplied cordless phone to communicate (I do know there were a handful in HR) so whenever I needed to contact her she could be anywhere upstairs, in a back room, or down in shipping and receiving and I'd never find her. We had to bend official policy and use our cell phones to stay in contact and even the store manager approved because their was no other way. As I said, it was a new position, so they had estimated my hours but inevitably I was scheduled more than needed. Some days my work kept me busy all day, but it wasn't uncommon for me to finish in under two hours, only half an hour at my fastest, and still have the rest of a six or eight hour shift. The logical thing would have been for me to leave, but since I was technically a vendor paid by Frango to work at Macy's, I felt like they saw me as free labor. Admittedly, I did volunteer to work in other departments because I wouldn't be able to take the boredom of six hours of nothing to do but straighten, and I should have pushed harder to better explain that overworking myself would lead to longer time off due to my disability, but ultimately I felt pressured to ""try"" their schedules because I could never give a definitive answer as to what would set me off. I felt stressed and generally used while working there a lot of the time and was not eager to continue, but that was more of a unique situation to me. For everyone else who works at Macy's, I would hope someone reevaluates the organizational structure of the company and make things easier on its employees.

Wed Dec 02 2020, Sales Associate,"White Plains, NY",Former Employee ,It’s not for everybody,0,"Overall the company offers flexible hours and decent benefits.
","The management team at this location varies in ability. You have a handful of competent managers who know what they’re doing and a ton that don’t, mainly because they were promoted too young or don’t posses the requisite skill sets for the jobs they have. The culture is also a major issue. Sales Associates at White Plains are routinely abused by unruly and obnoxious customers. Store policies change on a dime and are not well received by customers who blame associates. It also doesn’t help that the company sends out coupons without properly articulating what they are good for just to get customers in the door who then blame associates when they can’t use said coupons. Managers are generally unhelpful and hide in their offices. Their attitudes are also extremely poor in dealing with their subordinates. With the exception of a few, most set unrealistic goals for their teams and lash out at them when they can’t accomplish these goals. Most of these goals are related to maintaining standards and recovery. You’ll have 1 or maybe 2 associates if you’re lucky for an entire department, left to deal with lines of customers, clean fitting rooms and recover fixtures all by themselves without any help from their managers who are constantly off gossiping in their offices. Managers will almost always yell at associates for not recovering their areas, calling them lazy, when in reality one associate is juggling the responsibilities of 3-4 associates while assisting customers. We’re also never allowed to acknowledge that we keep getting asked to do more while the company continues to shrink the number of associates assigned to each area. It constantly feels like you’re being set up to fail. Some managers are decent and join their associates on the proverbial front lines to assist when necessary and are genuinely pleasant to work with. Others see themselves more as “executives” and sniff their nose at the thought of doing any task an associate typically does.

","I didn't like that I was to earn commission. It added more pressure for me when I was placed in a department with products I was not familiar with at all. I also didn't like the pressure of having make or steal sales. I just like having to talk to the customers or just ringing them up.

Competitive salary for new employees.
Very flexible when scheduling vacation and paid time off days.
Employees that are laid off are given great severance packages and given a great amount of respect throughout the entire process.
The company is increasing benefits and bonuses for IT employees that are not in upper management level.
","Competitive salaries are only adjusted for new employees.
Raises and promotions are rare, unless you are essential for things to keep running.
Politics play a huge role for raises and promotions at upper management level.
Any time that collaboration between teams need to occur there are large project delays.
Low incentive to improve performance when raises are currently so low.
