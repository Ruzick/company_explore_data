Diverse workforce & diversity initiatives 
Fun and funny coworkers
Opportunities for growth
Again, this was all four years ago and has likely changed
","(At the time and now, according to other comments)

Arrogant to a fault
Total lack of innovation & willingness to innovate
Odd attachment to the company's past (which prevents progress)
High number of veterans (20+ years) who are determined to get that retirement money, and therefore, are resistant to change and technology
Heavy reliance on command and control management style
Poor decision-making that leads to losses of all kinds
Advice to Management
When I was first hired to State Farm back in 2010, I felt truly blessed and fortunate. I felt I had found my work ""home,"" and that I would be able to learn and grow over time, and watch my career develop. And guess what? It did. I held three different positions at State Farm, each ""better"" than the last in terms of challenge, growth, and pay. I used to brag to others about State Farm and actively try to recruit them. I was a true believer and evangelist.

State Farm was like an abusive relationship in that, there were times when things were good! Really good! And then, there were those bad times... 

Even though my career was progressing, I was met at every level with some of the most hateful, spiteful, narcissistic leadership you could ever imagine. Egomaniacs and control freaks of the highest order. It was almost like they didn't want us to succeed, for fear that we may take their jobs someday. The behaviors got so bad that I even told one of my managers, ""There's no amount of money in this world that could get me to do your job. You all seem miserable."" This was toward the end of our relationship, of course. In each role, my managers found something, anything they could to harp on, and once I fixed that, something new would pop up to ""fix."" It was a moving target. They never taught, they only scolded. They treated employees of every age like children, from age 21 to age 61. It was disgraceful. 

Others took the time to focus on my personality. My work product was excellent and above standard according to one, but they always shifted the focus to my ""happiness."" ""Are you happy? You don't seem happy. Others are worried that you're not happy. Are you happy? Your happiness, or lack thereof, is affecting the team."" When I'd ask clarifying questions like, ""What makes you think I'm not happy?"" ""How is it affecting the team?"" ""Describe a time when you distinctly thought I wasn't happy..."" they couldn't do it. Never could. It morphed into vague generalizations and hearsay (made up stuff). They could never give me actionable specifics, and therefore, I could never correct the ""problems."" 

At the time, I did not realize that I was witnessing the beginning of the end. Everything that happened to me was symptomatic of a company preparing to enter into decline. Instead of leadership banding together and figuring out how to fix it, they chose to eat their babies. And they're paying for it dearly now.

The second part of this title is to trust your gut, and this is where I'll speak to current employees: When I quit State Farm, people thought I was crazy. I had a great title and pay. I had climbed through the ranks relatively quickly. The path was clear, but I wasn't willing to fight off psychopaths along the way. So I trusted my belief that I could do better for myself, and I did. You don't deserve poor treatment from anyone, and especially not your employer. Sometimes you have to vote with your feet. Although you will be brainwashed, threatened, and intimidated, State Farm is not the end all be all. There is life outside of SF. There are other industries. Regardless of what you do, you have picked up some valuable skills that are highly transferable in the marketplace. Don't give up on yourself. Start saving money and get out of there. You will survive and you will be better for it.

","Though they claim to foster creativity and encourage ""outside the box"" thinking, leadership at ""the farm"" is devoted to the status quo. It is a stiflingly corporate environment that attempts to attract young talent under the guise of being cutting edge but it offers little more than stability. Senior and executive leadership chooses to promote straight white men who have been at the company their entire adult lives rather than elevate individuals with actual expertise in design/UX. You could be a top performer, win awards, be tasked with training new hires, and be at the company for years without a single mention of promotion if you happen to be anything outside of the ""wrong"" color, gender, or sexual orientation. You'll notice that the higher up in management you go at State Farm, the more homogenous things look, and it isn't because of the lack of talent among minority and female individual contributors. They tend to run their most creative talent off with limited growth opportunities and miserly salary ranges that are, in no way, competitive. If you stay long enough, you develop Stockholm Syndrome or just become complacent enough to no longer care that your youth and talent are being wasted as a cog in the mega-corporate machine where you will never have a meaningful impact.
Advice to Management
Being a giant company that offers stability may have been enough to keep boomers content to stick it out, but younger generations require more than a paycheck to remain committed to an employer. Hire more diverse, younger senior leaders who aren't so drunk on the State Farm kool-aid that they can understand why you're constantly bleeding your best and brightest.

","At the beginning of 2020, employees were told that if we as a company met certain goals, we would receive a bonus, and the bonus would be higher if we exceeded the goals. Now we far surpassed the goals, and I am told we will be getting lower raises this year due to the high bonuses. What do you think this does to morale? Do they honestly think many people will think positively about the bonuses again? It is akin to reverting on a promise in my opinion.
Advice to Management
Be honest with the employees about bonuses. Discontinue bonuses if you are going to cut raises because your employees achieved good bonuses (and tried really hard to meet them). Anything else is a poor method of management in that regard in my opinion.

Customers are calling in because they need assistance with resolving an issue. Staff can't give undivided attention to the caller if they have to keep up with 20 different call metric expectations at the same time. Instead of dragging your staff about how many times they say the client's name during the call, focus on addressing and correcting the reasons why so many clients are calling so much in the first place. If a customer or an agent has to call 4 times just to get a transaction processed, then perhaps upgrading to a more user-friendly Operating System is more important than keep track of hold times, call transfers, or verbal scripts.

","-There's the wrong way to do things and there's the 'State Farm' way (i.e. if you go against the culture in anyway, you become ostracized)
- They pay lip service to ""up-skilling"" but only allow favorite employees time and money to attend quality training beyond online videos or click-through classes
- If you like business processes and enjoy talking to 5-12 different people before you get any work done related to your job, then go with State Farm's Information Security department. 
- They have an odd obsession with Agile and Scrum, even for non-developmental/technical teams. It rewards people who can speak in buzz words and break down work as opposed to finding an actual creative solution to actual problems.
- I've spoke with multiple people who state that they would do almost anything else, but stick around because of the high salaries, raises, and bonuses (e.g. golden handcuffs). Apparently if you can deal with being generally miserable every day, then this is the job for you.
- You will not be well-rounded here. State Farm is a huge company and they can afford to have people work only on one ""flavor"" of a job at a time (governance, scripting, Federation, etc - only) so that if you try to leave, you are far behind your peers and don't have the well-rounded skills to keep up and get hired elsewhere (see Golden handcuffs comment) so you become stuck since you can't go anywhere else (don't do this to yourself!).
Advice to Management
- Stop rewarding sycophant employees who treat coworkers like they are less-than
- Stop using Agile/Scrum in liberally everything you do. It is incredibly frustrating to try to complete a product/project but get hammered if it is not completely up to the standard of one dominant personality. What happened to the ""Most Viable Product"" (MVP)?
- Leadership is completely aloof and not available, in particular if you're new or not an established employee 
- Honestly, I see why a huge company has to segment their departments and have people specialized in specific aspects of their industry/department. It is just mind-numbing and soul sucking to be enslaved to a process, buzzwords, and disingenuous brown-noser teammates. I would never recommend State Farm to anyone - especially for working within the Information Security department.

- 6 weeks paid parental leave for both parents including for adoption and can take additional 4 weeks unpaid or as PTO. 
- $10,000 adoption reimbursement per child per parent who works at SF. 
- First $1k of deductible is paid by SF and it rolls over each year if you don't use it. (I just had a child which cost me $0 out of pocket)
- Covid has pushed leadership to stress the work/life balance. It sounds like working from home and hybrid options will be available post-pandemic. 

Great leadership can make a bad job tolerable. The upper management and VPs that I have interacted with have been sharp, competent, and actually seem to care about the problems facing lower level employees.
","SF is so big that getting anything changed takes forever. Some areas can be billed as fast changing, but they are not. Everything is slow. Lower level jobs can get repetitive and monotonous. They have done a pretty poor job of anticipating job and staffing needs in some departments (CCC and Claims). Middle management and first line leaders can either be incredibly competent or have no business being in leadership, they just jumped through the hoops and were given the job for that reason.

","Everything in Express is based off metrics, NOT your customer service skills. When customers call in after an accident, they have a wide variety of emotions. I have had many calls where a customer just unloads everything they have been bottling up, and so I listen, while helping them in the claim.. This tends to mess up my metrics, but I am not one to shoo people away that are reaching out. 
Express has a huge turnover rate. They have 2 training classes of roughly 30 new hires. They do this every other month. So they hire about 360/yr... in the 10 months I have been here, out of the 60 that went through training at the same time as myself, 24 are left... 
In Training, the Instructors and management would continuously tell us how easy and how often moving to different departments is.. this is not true. We have had so many leave, that the ones left have a freeze and we can’t move.. 
From my experience, and all the coworkers I know, we are treated like Children, questioned on bathroom breaks, water breaks etc....

State Farm is WAY too slow to innovate and may actually be too big of a company for its own good right now.. Younger customers (and potential employees) don't even bother with the ""big five"" traditional insurers and going to newer, smaller startup providers.

Core customer market is aging and most seniors NOT tech savvy yet you still push tech-based solutions at them??? Please make sure any technology you implement ACTUALLY WORKS and works consistently, that is 50% of angry customer calls. Younger customers DO NOT like the traditional agent-based business model and expect corporate to take care of everything start to finish.

","The metric system they use is impossible to meet on a daily basis. Your wrap time has to be 25 seconds or less, and your talk time cannot be more than 5 minutes when speaking with customers. When I first started working there in 2016 I loved my job and I saw so many different avenues to move up in the company. The longer I stayed the more the company changed and started to not care about their employees. I have seen people over looked for supervisor positions who has been there for 5-10 years for State Farm to hire someone off the street. I have seen good people lose their jobs behind not meeting their numbers or they may have a family emergency and cannot come into work for a couple of days. They brought in the point system which was so ridiculous..... An employee was rushed to the hospital in the ambulance from the building and she received points while rolling out on the stretcher!!!!!!!! I have always worked with top tier companies and this was by far the worst company ever. Their yearly bonus is a joke........... State Farm pays their employees the least out of all the other insurance companies in the industry. Like a good neighbor State Farm is not there for their employees.
Advice to Management
While your coaching people on how to improve their numbers hop on the phone yourself at least a couple days out the week. Do a full 8 hours shift and let me know if those metrics are still reasonable for a human being!!!!

No other pros.
","Be ready to be treated like a slave if you are a developer. You know, the ""I said it so you do it"" type attitude from management. 
Pay is way below average for industry standards. 
Coworkers are rude and full of themselves and also extremely unqualified for their roles. They take on the tag of software developer because that is the last role that is affected when there is a layoff.
There are several roles that individual people take on like product owner, scrum master, manager which can all be done by team members and/or manager. This leads to some people doing all the work on the team and not being appreciated enough since they are paying so many people in these roles.
Loyalty is valued over quality of work. Suck up to your manager and stick for longer years if you need any kind of promotion or raise. Hard work will get you nowhere here. Thanks to the politics. You will always be told you are not good enough and you need to do something else than your expertise( why even hire someone with that expertise and expect them to excel in something else? Lame)
Software developers are hired to do infrastructure analysts type work. There is no development work on any of the teams in Phoenix. If you are a developer looking for a good experience look elsewhere. 
The managers. Oh my God. Non technical, rude, disrespectful, do not care about employee development. HORRIBLE MANAGERS. 
Most people who work here have no interest in actually doing the job. They talk. And talk. And just talk. And get promoted by talking. So if you are really technically good but don't talk as much nonsense as these other idiots nobody will listen to you or appreciate what you do. 
If all of this sounds interesting to you then please go ahead and join, they always have openings thanks to disgruntled employees quitting and people not willing to join.
I would give this company 0 stars if I could. Please avoid if you have any self respect. 
Oh also, their job postings are full of lies. There is no active work in the advertised technologies. 
Welcome to the land of old technologies, non technical managers telling you that you are not good enough and coworkers going out of their way to avoid doing actual work.

You are unfit to be at the management level. Do a good deed and fire yourselves. Go take some technical courses and training and see how difficult it really is to actually do the work and not just talk.

Wed Dec 16 2020,Anonymous,"Richardson, TX",Current Employee ,"Good job until I got Covid-19 - run from this job, don't walk",1,"I got licensed to produce insurance.
","I still work here but likely not for much longer. If you have been employed by State Farm for less than a year, don't get sick. I work in the Licensed CCC Sales department in Richardson, Texas, selling insurance to customers in several states.

I was diagnosed Covid-19 positive in April of this year. I reported it to my supervisor and was denied paid leave and told to apply for unpaid family medical leave. I was denied due to State Farm's policy stating that only employees who have worked at State Farm for a year or more qualify for even unpaid protected leave. I had been working there for 6 months and was denied as a result. 

I told my supervisor the situation hoping that an exception could be made for someone with Covid-19 diagnosis from a doctor, as I had, and I was offered no help. I was then threatened discipline and termination for calling in sick 4 times while being sick with Covid-19. 

So, I worked sick (got sicker doing it) so as not to lose my badly needed income. My doctor then diagnosed me with Covid-19 syndrome requiring intermittent leave to have total and complete rest. My doctor and I applied for protected intermittent leave again in August being told that some of State Farm’s policies had changed. This time my department itself denied me leave protection because I did not qualify as a new employee when I applied for leave when I had Covid-19 in April. 

Since this began in April, the threats and disciplinary actions from my department's leadership have not not stopped, and they're working on getting ""cause"" to terminate me. I expect they will soon.

Also, you get an assigned alias, which is pretty cool, although you cannot select it yourself.
","Depends on the agent of course, and I've worked for several. Some employment contracts are determined by how much you sell, but since I was a service person, I negotiated a salary. I got a decent paying job with an annual raise. If the agent sales side begins to die down, the service people are expected to pick up the slack and pivot/offer/sell insurance, regardless of whether you have any willingness and/or skills to do it or not. In other words, you can basically be forced to be a part time sales person even if it's not what you signed up for. Some agents also have a minimum quota of writing certain lines to stay employed (example: 10 auto policies a month, 3 dwelling type, and 1 umbrella).
Advice to Management
Stop forcing service people to pick up the slack for the sales department (i.e. hire better salesmen), and ask for anonymous input/advice/feedback from your team (it makes a world of difference when everybody wins).

","This job kinda just throws you to the wolves. On the phones all day. You dont take ownership of any claims so you are fixing other claims associate mistakes and being yelled at for their mistakes. Management pushes metrics and some are just not realistic to achieve. There is no room for advancement because when a position comes available and you apply you receive a email stating that you have been taking from consideration per you leadership. This means that your department is in a freeze and no one can be accepted for other opportunities at this time which usually last about 3 months. You feel stuck and low moral tarts to set in. You do a development plan but there is no follow up from your Team Manager.
Advice to Management

","management isn't held accountable even after being reported to HR for inappropriate behavior. systems are from 1919 and desperately NEED to be updated as it clearly effects customer experience. HR needs to be cleaned out as well as upper management as an HR report will lead to them harrassing, berating, and intimidating employees to drop the report or quit so they don't have to pay out unemployment. Company is SUPER political (right wing conservative) but feigns progressiveness and inclusivity to stay relavant. They DO NOT care about POC, disabled, or those who do not check the box for ""normal"" they WILL find ways to force you to quit or fire you outright.
Advice to Management
Update systems to 2020. Start taking employees sides over management. Management is replaceable too and people who abuse their power to make inappropriate actions against their immediate employees should be investigated and never allowed to be in charge. Clean out HR department as well while you're cleaning your management. Do better as a company to actually care about everyone involved in making the CEO billions.

Tue Oct 06 2020, Claim Associate,"Bloomington, IL",Former Employee ,Employees treated poorly,0,"Access to continuing education classes.
","I worked at State Farm for around 3 1/2 years in an entry level claims job. I was told when I was hired in 2016 that my incumbency was 1 year. When my 1 year incumbency was up, they told my hiring class that they couldn’t let us leave our jobs because they were restructuring the dept. They continued to restrict the amount of employees leaving our dept all the way up until I left and I was blocked from being interviewed for around 15-20+ jobs over that time period. Meanwhile, other employees were given unrestricted access to those opportunities just because they weren’t in my dept. The company even began filling claim specialist roles (a promotion for me) with people off the street that had no claims experience. When I was blocked from interviewing for a job, I was told by a generic automated email. Nothing like a canned response to make employees feel good. Very little information was ever communicated to me about when I could possibly get a better job. I had to ask and even then I was always given generic answers like “well maybe in a few months”. My former team member decided to relocate hours away. They told their mgr they were moving no matter what and there was a job in the area they were moving to within SF that they wanted to apply for. The answer they ended up getting from mgmt was that they couldn’t make an exception and allow them to apply for it. Even though they were moving no matter what. All the training and continuing education the company invested down the drain because they’re too stubborn. How does a fortune 50 company handle employees like this? It’s baffling. It’s just blatant mismanagement. It became so evidently clear that mgmt is incapable of viewing employees, especially lower level, as people instead of numbers on an excel spreadsheet. They don’t care enough. As long as the metrics they are pushed to meet get met, they don’t care. They say they care about quality work but in reality they don’t. They only care about meeting metrics focused on quantity. If you have mediocre work but you do a lot of it, they’ll love you.
Advice to Management
Treat employees like people instead of numbers on spreadsheet. Shift focus from quantity of work completed to quality. Stop political hiring practices that are unfair to employees that don’t know the “right person”.

","Benefits and pay structure vary from agent to agent. Have to juggle doing service tasks while being paid a very small base rate and commission for sales. Be sure to ask your agent how they get leads for sales staff and how big their book of business is. If the location of your office is not a hotspot for new business and client book is small, you won’t have enough prospects to make ends meet.

Advice to Management
My family has a history of working for State Farm so when I was hired on I was happy to carry on that tradition at a local agents office especially since I sold insurance at my previous job so I felt good about it. It began great but turned sour the more I worked for the agent. At first if I had questions they were grateful to give me advice on but after a couple of months they refused to answer any new question. Also when I started I was making less than minimum wage per hour now a couple months later after moving to the sales role, cause they start you at the very bottom, I make $1 over minimum plus commission which is fine but now new hires who where hired after me and are doing aged leads are getting paid the same as me per hour and are starting to do the duties of my job and the agent even told them I will be giving a raise soon to you. So you mean to tell me I'm getting paid less than a kid in college who doesn't have any knowledge of insurance like I do more money than me and more hours? I'm sorry but agents don't do squat but reap all the benefits and will only give you some training and won't help you after a month or 2. I came thinking I would grow into a very knowledgeable sales person but am coming out less able to do the job I was promoted to do than I did starting out because they try to train you to forget about what has worked for you cause it's only what they wanna teach you that you can use. Had the potential to become my favorite job but State Farm has changed from a top tier company to one that only cares about money and money alone.

Thu Aug 27 2020, Agent,,Former Employee ,IT REALLY DEPENDS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AS A CAREER,0,"Startup costs and expenses vary based on business decisions, location, and cost of living. There is no minimum or maximum amount of capital that will be needed by you to set up and operate your business; the decision of how much investment you make into your business is your decision as an independent contractor agent.
","You need to make sure you have a business savvy agent. One that knows how to market and adapt to technology. The process to become an agent is actually VERY long and the pay is not very good...again depending on the agent that you are working with and their book of business. There are other insurance places out there that have a better platform to run an agency...in my opinion! Also the software is very old and needs to be updated. If you want to get any investment licenses this is also not the place. Normal push for life insurance and commercial insurance is expected.
Advice to Management
In today’s dynamic business environment, the end customer has more information than at any time in human history. To remain competitive, organizations need to find canidates who can strike a balance between analytic and interpersonal skills. Candidates/employees need to be observed through a qualitative lens rather than a quantitative one; where naturally, ""industry tenure"" seems to outweigh skill and digital dexterity.
