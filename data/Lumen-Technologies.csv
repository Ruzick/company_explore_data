Tue Jan 12 2021, Account Manager,,Current Employee ,Great company to start your career at,0,"I was part of the College Connect Sales Academy that runs for 12 weeks before you are put in market. It is designed for recent college graduates. I really found that it gave me an in depth knowledge of a career in sales. 
In terms of the role itself, you get to own your own accounts and have a support team including a Solution Engineer, Customer Success Manager and your Sales Director to support you and help you make sales. It’s nice to have your own book of business and decide how you want to work with each account. The commission structure is also good, as long as your are hitting or exceeding your quota.
","After the big restructure in late 2020 and getting rid of the global team and verticals (I.E. pharma, oil and gas, manufacturing), the company is losing it’s unique spark. I am now in the mid market group and have 45 accounts I manage, with only 3 actually billing and the other ones dark/dim. I feel as though management is setting unrealistic goals of having 5 meetings a week, 2.5 times your quota per week and 10 times your quota per month (this pertains to regional mid market group). There will be months where you do not have any sales at all, however on the other hand, there will be times you hit or exceed your monthly quota. Your success with sales really depends on the accounts you get as well as timing (meaning do the accounts have the budget to implement what solution you are proposing to them, does this align with their monthly, quarterly or yearly goals). You may work extremely smart and hard prospecting in the accounts (both billing and dark/dim) and still get nothing. I also feel that a promotion is also based on luck (meaning how well you are doing with sales in your accounts).
Advice to Management
Please set more realistic expectations and rethink your quota and meeting goals for the week and month. If a person is given dark/dim accounts to grow, the AM’s expectation is hope for the best and expect the worst, meaning if you reach out to those non billing customers, you are lucky if you get a response.

Pros
Training opportunities to further your skills.
Cons
Complicated processes. Acquired many companies and never integrated systems. Even though changed name of company it’s still like a legacy telco. Support teams have no sense of urgency. Takes weeks to get simple quotes done. Customer escalations are frequent. Constant turnover. Fire frequently.
Advice to Management
Deal with complicated processes and stop the constant firing. Customers are the losers in the process and are leaving in droves. Fix things. Open your eyes to what is really going on in a day in the life of sale person.

Since when are benefits determined by Perkins Coie??? Shame on you Lumen!!! Because you knowingly and willfully have harmed me, you are sadistic!!! I have lost a home, declared bankruptcy, been involuntarily committed to a hospital because I could not afford food and lost so much weight my doctor thought death was imminent (5'6"" - 113 lbs)...this is just a small list of the consequences I am paying for your horrific behavior. How odd that you find pleasure in this. I am a disabled widow, is this what you would want for you, your friends or your family?

","The Benefits are just insulting, you don’t even get an employee deal on their services but if you don’t have their service then you could get written up if your internet goes down. They say it’s because they can’t verify an outage with any other internet provider, only their own. Clearly a lie. Management is rude and full of themselves. Micromanaged heavily. Everything you say on the a call is dictated by your boss. They find reasons to Mark you down on weekly evaluations. There will always be a flaw on calls, nobody is perfect. But they can use anything to mark you down so it’s really a popularity contest too. If your manager likes you then you won’t get coached for being human.

","Leadership out of touch with reality. Back end systems and processes are broken beyond repair. Employees more concerned with process than taking care of customers. Sales comp plan structure is overly complex and getting complete and accurate accounting is impossible. HR is over bearing and inserts itself into management decisions making it impossible to retain good talent and hanging on to terrible employees. Every answer is NO . ""Compliance' is blamed for all things that get messed up, declined or otherwise screwed up. Spent 99% of my time fixing problems instead of doing my job. Complete disregard for common sense, Leadership is completely out of touch. Personally saw serious pay inequities for minority employees and had to bare knuckle fight HR to correct what was obvious discrimination for one employee whilst watching under performers get a pass. Customer implementations were all botched and delayed for internal process errors . The network outages were constant and not taken seriously. Response to outages were slow and nobody cared about the impact to the customer or their business. 
 Single handedly the worst professional experience I have had in anotherwise fantastic 25+ year career in this industry.
Advice to Management
You can change the companies name and branding, but it might as well be putting bark dust over dog poop. Your problems in the back office are still there. Ed Morche and Jeff Storey are clueless . Bring in new leadership and take a good hard look at the back office process . Get HR and Compliance out of the way so that people can do their jobs. Take a good hard look at discrimination in your hiring and compensation - inequities are there you just don't care to address them. Hiring outside consultants to re-architect the sales organization will not fix the underlying issue of a messy back office. Again it's like putting lipstick on a pig.

Lots of jobs available both internally and externally. Comprehensive (though non-differentiating) benefit package. Solid severance.
","Odds of this being read by Lumen is sub 10%. Obviously this is based on my experience. Nearly every major known ""red flag"" for a new employee happened inside 4 weeks of starting employment: expected reporting location changed from a 19 minute drive to a 1:05 minute drive with no choice (pre-pandemic). Primary job role/function agreed upon during interview process and hiring was changed to a completely different repsonsibility/expectation outside the functional area of expertise (think ""applied and hired as a plumber, job changed to electrician upon arrival), expected job hours changed significantly from ""work when makes sense"" to ""be here when we expect you too on our schedule,"" and most importantly, the primary mandate of the group I was part of was not attainable due to organizational structure changes that were already in motion PRIOR to my hire, but were still known changes (this group won't exist in 6 months.

Most employees have been around a very long time - the most commonly expressed reason for this as quoted by them was ""keep your head down, always express agreement until the flavor changes again because it always does, and try not to own a program because most don't succeed and you don't want to sink with a ship.

Decent benefits.
Good paid time off.
","Where do I start?
Working for the the phone company was a great thing. Always something to learn, people to help you, managers that were actually coaches. I could see myself staying with the phone company.

Now you get managers that have no clue what you actually do for a job. They give you ratings without being able to tell you exactly what they mean.

This company has lost more knowledge on day to day activities than people still around. They keep pushing out valuable people without training others. Management’s solution is to automate, offshore or contract the work to someone else, to save money. So if you’re involved with any of those three, great place to be.

Continually there are attempts to innovate, but poor development and poor planning leads to failed attempts. This all leads to poor employee attitude and poor customer service.

Before level 3, Centurylink or Qwest mergers there was a great phone company, USWest was an awesome place to be and work. Now they change the name and have great plans for anything having to do with Level 3 or the enterprise side of the company, but again the phone company gets left behind. Careers are a thing of the past!

There's a really strong, family-oriented culture here too, where I've always felt very supported by my peers and mentors. They truly make an effort to improve the employee experience as well. It's also very forward thinking, where there always trying to be ahead of the curve, which provides a lot of cool opportunities to do different roles. They're also good about hiring internally, but also value the perspective of someone new. It's a good balance/range of employees who have been here for 20-30 years and young professionals.
","There's a lot of change at this company, and there usually isn't much time to get used to something before it changes again. The change is very forward thinking and eventually you understand how it'll benefit the company, but often there's a lot going on in the background and you won't find out until a big company announcement is made. It can be competitive sometimes too, but that might depend on where you work/what role you're in. They usually promote having good work like balance, but you can certainly get burnt out just as easily depending on your role.

Advice to Management
CTL (now Lumen) is a mix-match of companies that provides their customers the same antiquated experience as their employees. The company has no clear vision and is trying to rebrand, as the CTL brand seems to be irreparable. The rebrand will only further the deception of their customer base and shareholders. I do not recommend working here as you will only deal with outdated employee equipment, faulty customer solutions & unreasonable goals. Prediction - CTL will be parted for their network infrastructure. (Lumen rebrand = lipstick on a pig)

It's very important for a company to protect it's employees, especially during these trying times, and I feel that CenturyLink has met the challenge and continues to improve upon operations in such a way that safety is always a top priority. The company implemented work from home early on, provides PPE to those still working in the buildings or with the public, and created a platform for employees to voice their concerns.
","The downside would be the yearly reduction in force activities that take place, however, this is done in all businesses and unfortunately not something we can be immune from.

","This place is focused more on sales then the actual customer support side of the business. They want you to push sales down the customers throats, and they don’t care what their situation is. So people can be behind on bills, pissed off, fixed income, WHATEVER and you still have to sale. It’s really uncomfortable to push customers off the phone and not really resolve their issues. It’s really stressful to have back to back calls for a 9 hour shift and a majority of those calls you are being yelled at or told how much this company sucks. They are under staffed so expect to be there after closing. They don’t have enough support help so you can ask a question and get a vague af answer. Then not hear anything back for 10 or more mins. But then be yelled at for being on a call for 15 mins. This place is a joke.

","The organization is going through financial chaos and it’s employees who pay the price. Don’t guarantee on job stability or security. I saw employees terminated so departments could meet poorly planned budgets just to have “new” jobs posted shortly after the fiscal year. If your job isn’t terminated then they probably will change it beyond recognition without any conversation. They haven’t had Merit increases for multiple years (4+) so negotiate hard before you join because you probably won’t see more. Don’t expect to have any autonomy or decision making, everything is top down and you’ll probably have multiple levels and verticals of leadership involved with every detail. Decisions move slow and leave limited room for changing the status quo.

Tue Jun 23 2020, Senior Director,"Littleton, CO",Current Employee ,Great Place to Work!,0,"Great company with great benefits. Given the large network, resources and employee base, we are able to provide customers what they want in service and support as technology evolves. It is a very large company with employees and opportunities across the globe including a solid culture, unifying principles and competitive wages. The CEO and other Senior leaders are committed to the company and the customers we serve and it is exciting to be a part of this journey.
","Being a technology company, while exciting and ever changing can be very demanding and sometimes overwhelming as customers are reliant on our business success to lead to theirs. The challenge is always putting the customer first which sometimes leads to a mismatch in work/life balance. Another downside is that it is very difficult to serve the newest innovation/products to customers in established or remote areas due to high cost which unfortunately is misunderstood by most and sometimes leads to negative brand perception.

Advice to Management
You desperately need to update your corporate culture, philosophy, and bring in fresh ideas from outside of your firm. Working for this company is like taking a time machine back to 1986. People have more options for employment than ever, whether it's working remotely for another company or starting their own small venture/enterprise. It's never been easier to leave a bad situation and there's less judgement than ever (particularly during a pandemic) for doing so.

By staying locked in an antiquated mindset and micromanaging everything an employee does and when they do it, all you will do is keep the sad, old lifers who just want their benefits and long ago learned to keep their own opinions and ideas to themselves. You'll lose and chase away the folks who have options and who are unwilling to settle for a depressed / oppressing workplace.

I worked at Lumen full-time for more than a year
Pros
1. Okay pay, but it's not competitive. Especially for what you have to deal with. You can find much better paying jobs that aren't as stressful. 
2. Benefits.
3. GREAT lower level management. Seriously, the supervisors are amazing.
4. Decent culture with teams and coworkers. You make good lifelong friends.
Cons
These are the reasons I left after being a consumer rep for two years. 

1. Too much scrambling around. I moved from customer care to sales and to retention (which was a pay cut of roughly $1500 a month) with hardly any warning or training each time. They actually lost several people because of this specific move. People get promoted and in two months get laid off. Entire centers are shut down with little notice so they can hire vendors overseas to save money. Constantly shifting from product to product - yes I understand split testing is part of marketing but we sold Directv for years, switched to Dish for a month, now we sell Dish, Directv, and AT&T TV. We have whiplash.

2. Horrible customer experience. This can be attributed to a number of things. 
- Slow internet speeds unless in a fiber city. 
- Poor training (I mean supervisors give you different answers to the same questions kind of poor training) which means that customers get WILDLY different experiences every single call. 
- Awful technicians and scheduling. I can't tell you how many customers I lost because the technicians neither showed up to their installations nor called the customers to let them know. Also in Fiber areas they had 2 hour appointment windows but in every other city your installs would sometimes date out up to a month out and make the customer wait between 8-5. Nobody wants to wait 30 days for internet. Same with repairs.
- Systems that don't work. We use 3 main account softwares. One that works great, one that works half the time, and one that doesn't hardly work at all and give the agents incorrect information. Guess which one they require us to use, and which one they are taking away?
- Multiple lawsuits over billing for a reason. They have fixed this mostly with their Price for Life but they still have many customers on older bundles who have no idea their bill is going to increase because they either don't tell them, or a representative misquotes them because of lack of training. 
- Multiple departments dont know what each other do, so customers get transferred several times before being assisted.

3. This is more of an opinion. We all feel that upper level management doesn't care about us or the customer. It's only about money. There is no open door policy. You can talk to your center manager but nobody else will listen to you. Even when you do great work it feels like you're punished and your work is not enough.
Advice to Management
Upper management please take a look at going back to the basics and improving your customer experience. 

Spend the money to upgrade facilities and get customer faster speeds. Nobody can do anything on 3mbps internet. 

Fix your problems with the technicians. Spectrum does one hour appointment windows with several text, email, and phone notifications and even a live tech tracker. AND they do repairs same day. You all do repairs 3-30 days out with NO notifications. 

You're doing good with Price for Life don't ruin it. 

Work out the kinks in your software. Customers shouldn't have to be on the phone for an hour trying to pay a bill because nothing works. This goes along with the transfer process.

Train your agents better. You get very very basic training on the systems, but you learn nothing about sales or customer service or how to handle specific problems. 

Give employees a way to express ourselves without the fear of being a cog in a machine that's easily replaceable.

Tue Apr 21 2020, Lead Systems Engineer,"Town and Country, MO",Former Employee ,Not a great career opportunity,5,"Diverse environment - there's everything from high-end cloud to ancient Solaris and WS2003 boxes. If you ever wanted to learn the breadth of IT, this is a good place. 

Benefits - The Health Care and 401k are decent, the STI is generally reliable. 

Work/Life Balance - The PTO is pretty fair. I was almost never denied a day off.
","Pay - New corporate philosophy is not to give employees raises or COLA. Employees had bonuses and raises taken, then were told they were going to readjust for raises quarterly (they lied, this never happened) then intentionally pushed every manager to flatten their stack to avoid raises. 

But hey, lots of EBITDA!

The management stack on the CTL Business side is downright ghoulish with how disconnected they are from workers. Your frontline manager may or may not care, but it's almost certain that you will very rarely communicate with director, and never communicate with your VP, unless it's them talking to you in a Zoom Meeting. 

This company unequivocably does not care about their employees. They RIFfed hundreds of employees to India, and then had a tone-deaf Hawaiian Shirt Day. They have a tendency to do this - take all the bonuses, but then buy some cupcakes or somesuch. 

They've changed operational paradigms on employees repeatedly, moving Systems Engineers to DevOps without any sort of training or expectation, pushing employees into Project Management without any sort of understanding or training. These employees will generally get hammered by management for not performing a role they weren't hired or trained for. 

Corporate culture is a mess and nepotism and favoritism is rampant. Certain managers are notorious for padding their teams with incompetent employees who were somebody's sexual partner or buddies who rode motorcycles or other complete BS. Pushing back against this nonsense tends to get you branded a malcontent. 

They're also incredibly, stupidly greedy - promoting employees from lower teams at lower pay rates and refusing to readjust them to equivalency with the direct hires until those people leave. 

This culture has so broken the hiring process that many teams have had to hiring in overpaid contractors. The only teams that can fill are entry-level, so anybody entry-level with even a slight spark of talent gets poached up to the middle teams, even though they're unqualified, which drags down the middle teams and the entry-level equally.
Advice to Management
Re-evaluate everyone in the CTL Business stack. (I'd say start from the top, but since the company seems hyper-focused on shareholder returns, so the board's never going to do that...)

Wed Dec 04 2019,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,CTL is going downhill fast,12,"There are still some good people left there and you can be a rock star if you understand the telecom business but, don’t look for advancement opportunities because those are few and far between and are only available to former Level 3 employees. Work life balance is good but not good enough to offset the fear and risk of being randomly laid off.
","CenturyLink was a good company until it merged with Level 3. Level 3 leadership is in control and is in way over their heads. Many of the Level 3 leaders are inexperienced and don’t truly understand the business (especially regulated local markets) or how to lead. Level 3 has jettisoned all of the former CenturyLink tools and processes and put their own inferior tools and processes in place setting the company backwards 15 years and catapulting the company towards bankruptcy. Revenues are declining so the company cuts costs by laying off former Qwest/CenturyLink employees in order to meet earnings goals. Layoffs are continuous and secretive. Entire groups are suddenly gone. I chose to leave before I got laid off. 

CenturyLink has no realistic plan to grow revenues. They are in a declining revenue industry. The only way they can survive financially and stave off bankruptcy is to continue to lay off employees to manage earnings and hope that someone buys them before they have to file bankruptcy again. (Level 3 has filed bankruptcy twice previously.)

Leadership lies to employees regularly. For example, they are closing the office in New Century, KS in March 2020. In August 2019, they said they would not be laying off employees and that everyone could work from home if their VP approved. Apparently, a number of VPs don’t like work from home so 300 of the 800 employees in that office are getting laid off. 

Based on the recent employee survey, 2/3rds of employees would not recommend that their friends work for CenturyLink.

","This company used to be a great place to work, while it was Qwest, and then it got better with the merger with Centurylink. But since the Level 3 merger the company has gone in a very negative direction. The culture is cutthroat, leaders are condescending and autocratic, executives are evil gods that drive a tremendous amount of inefficiency and much wasted time throughout the company. They do this in the name of ""data driven"" but really all the analytics are political story telling to protect the VP and Director level. The culture that came from Level 3 and has swallowed up CTL is disturbingly negative.
Advice to Management
Ask the leaders of the company to actually adopt the One Company One Culture philosophy. The people at manager and below positions want it badly, and they are frustrated that nobody in a leadership position (Director and above) actually cares about it. Stop treating your employees like they work in a sweat shop. Tell the execs to stop wasting everyone's time on their political asks. Stop gutting the company and pretending that none of it is happening. Spotlight awards are great but they fly in the face of what actually happens there. Employees notice the contradiction between what the award says, and how they are treated. Start treating people with more respect. And maybe take a moment to check out how bad your culture ratings and employee NPS scores have become.

I have been working at Lumen full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Great team culture from what I've seen.
Cons
Where to start. There has been a lot of changes within the Sales organization. Layoffs, team adjustments, customer alignment, etc. The overall sales culture is horrible, along with the overall company culture. You can sense the horrible culture is rubbing off on your peers. Especially when it comes to needing help within the ecosystem. It has started to feel like people come in to just punch their time-card and leave for the day. Sales compensation is horrible and hard to understand. You'll consistently find yourself fighting month-after-month to get compensated correctly. If you're promoted while in your role, your pay raise may seem nice. However, your raise will be much less than it would be if you were a new hire off of the streets. Many tools and processes make your day-to-day hard. Service delivery is a huge part of the customer happiness. This is an area that doesn't help your case with keeping the customer happy. Consistent changes to processes and solutions. Telecom is also a dinosaur of an industry, so it makes it hard to compete with the competitors.

","I wish I had better defenses to bad psychological activities. Watch out for widespread narcissism. Gaslighting and the supply / flying monkeys. Especially from the Broomfield guys. Well, I only saw it from that office. Mental toughness training is essential, and if you're working for a gaslighter, get out of there. Don't put yourself through it. If you're stuck, a grey rock strategy might be best. Social psychology understanding is a must. I liken my experiences to the Robbers Cave Experiment. Just human nature at work, and unskilled or inattentive management failing to solve bad dynamics, or worse, encouraging these things. Get rid of people if they're not needed, or if needed, help build an environment conducive to success. Help build your people if they're truly needed or cut them loose. Training was not offered. Conflict resolution? Nothing.
Advice to Management
Mandatory skip-level reviews with feedback going to the executive level for adequate oversight. Independent exit interviews offered for EVERY one who leaves. My senior director conducted mine to cover his backside. Not independent. Not enough oversight when I was there. The nature of the job was to use best guesses at solving complex problems with little time to determine optimal solutions, and that's where the gaslighting from others came in. Little respect among team members. That reflects poorly on management skill. Fewer charismatic middle managers. Don't care about their fancy possessions or exotic vacation excursions. Focus should be on customer successes, not social status. Good luck.

Cons
L3 execs have taken over and are running the company into the ground, starting with the employees. The execs want to turn every position they can into a contract position. For those that are direct-hire, every excuse is used for why the annual bonus isn't going to be paid at full-rate. There was a particularly large hit to the expected bonus for CenturyLink employees post merger with L3. The L3 employees didn't get hit by this major cut to their bonus. L3 execs don't seem to know what they're doing, where they want to take the company, or even how to to operate a telephone company/ISP, much less how to run a successful one.

There is a constant push for ""one culture"", but what's really needed is a new executive team that actually cares about the employees and helping them succeed.

There does not seem to be any desire by the L3 executives that took over CenturyLink post-merger to learn about any pre-merger CenturyLink systems or to understand why the systems are the way they are (legal obligations, compliance, industry standards, record retention, etc). Due to this lack of care or understanding, there's a push to replace working and highly-integrated CenturyLink systems with disjointed and poorly conceived or implemented Level3 systems.

","If you work for CenturyLink as a Software Developer, your actual market value will decrease, because the company doesn't know how to run an IT department, and they will prevent you from growing meaningful experience. They'll treat you as an extension of the internal business customer, doing whatever work they don't want to do. The internal business client will give you as little information as they possibly can, and your management chain in IT will be spineless and cashless to you give you what you need to get the job done. The same business clients who throw wrenches in your wheels will be the same people who leave derogatory remarks on your review for being ineffective.

","The company culture has taken a nose dive since the Level 3 acquisition. Things are wildly unstable with layoffs secretly occurring every few months. Constant re-orgs make it difficult to get anything done because you have a new manager or even a whole new team every few months as well. Leadership provides little to no direction on what our strategy is, so you don't know whether your work product will even be used in the long run. Leadership is deliberately vague as to what is happening behind the scenes and why, which leads to a lot of distrust. Employees live in fear of being laid off on any given Friday, which was apparently always the case with Level 3, so much so that they called them ""Black Fridays."" Steer clear if you like a stable work environment.
Advice to Management
Talk to the people ""in the trenches"" rather than your immediate subordinate. You're too high up the chain to see what's actually happening on a day to day basis. If you're a VP, talk to your director's managers. If you're a director, talk to your managers' direct reports. If you're a manager, talk you your supervisors' direct reports. We need a skip-level meeting every 3 months. The people actually doing the work know what the reality is, and they are the ones who know what needs to be done, not you. Stop being so secretive all the time. We don't trust you anymore because everything is a surprise that comes out of nowhere. You lay hundreds of people off on a regular basis and are too cowardly to even mention it and explain why and what the process was for determining who was picked. If we don't know why, then we can't adjust our own situations and behavior to prevent it from happening to us. To the remaining employees it's demoralizing and impacts our work because we no longer feel any loyalty to the company, nor do we feel like our work even matters because we might be gone next week anyway.

Wed Aug 07 2019, Publications Specialist,"Arlington, VA",Former Employee ,"Decent compensation, but horrible job security",4,"I was offered a compensation package very competitive for the position I took. Farmers market every Thursday and metro stop directly near the Ballston location. Pretty decent office space except that is a little old and outdated.
","I felt like I started a job in a very unstable department with many coworkers who had a hostile work environment before I showed up. I was the first hire by the new department manager who had only began to run Publications about 5 months before I joined the team to replace an employee who made it out the department alive to another department directly supporting EIS. Because of the way many employees in this particular department had been mistreated in the past I think it left them very jaded and pitted against anyone/anything new. Most of the people here have been there for 5+years and never promoted or grew within the company/department
 Unfortunately, that is not a good thing and it told me plenty about the company in general. I even had numerous Proposal Mgrs request me as their support bc my coworkers who had been there forever didn't want to really work. Unfortunately, the merger happened and the coworkers knew layoffs were coming and in an effort to preserve their own jobs seemed to team up against me and bad talk me to our manager who was on short term disability for months right before yearly reviews. My review from my manager came back glowing as far as my work was concerned, but marked unfairly low for interpersonal skills for which when I asked for examples she could not provide anything. Just goes to show you... it doesn't matter if you do good work...it matters who your buddy buddy with and whose butt you kiss to keep your job. Also, parking g at this location was a RIP OFF!

Pros

Cons
Centurylink has no care for their employees, expect to be a easily replaced commodity. From a management perspective the upper echelon of leadership is bloated and disconnected. 
Aggressive sales practices lead to a ""wells fargo"" like culture of churning employees and drives unethical sales practices. Instead of dialing it back when this was uncovered via previous employees and law suites they tighten the vice and apply more pressure to their front line. 
You will work outside of your function and it will be required to do so, if your other work suffers as a result expect to be disciplined. When going to management expect to forfeit worklife balance because the company demands too much time and effort.

Flexible Time Off, generally a work life balance is on the employee to decide, but the pace required of this industry will often require overtime, but this is the same for most large organizations within a competitive market. My philosophy is that any job is what YOU make of it. Morale is a bit low but some of that is due to mergers and acquisitions and some of it is self induced.

Right before I left they changed the bidding schedule rank to include performance instead of just seniority, which is a move in the right direction since the company hasn't hired anyone for technical support in 2.5 years.
","Very low pay when compared with the same job with other companies like Spectrum, even after the 3% increase they gave because they saw we were underpaid (this was replaced by the 3% you would expect when you get a stellar year review). The company has steadily declined over the past two years with morale and opportunity. No one gets promoted to tier 2 anymore, so no possibility of a pay bump there. They also promise promotions or opportunities coming up and then say nothing for two years. The company used to give an annual Christmas bonus but suddenly two years ago, they stopped and didn't tell anyone until a few days before Christmas. They also cancelled any kind of merit raise, citing cash flow issues (this was right after the merger with Level 3 where humungous signing bonuses were given to execs). After backlash and hundreds of employees leaving the department, they did end up giving the 3% but not until May or June that year. This year the company announced they want a pay for performance culture but didn't even give a 3% raise to top performers in the department. We also got an email from the CEO essentially saying we needed to tighten our belts because the company was paying off debt and couldnt afford to pay us what we deserve. Employees in technical support are also dealing with very irate customers all day because the company doesn't put enough money into preventative maintenance of the network. It's then doubled up because the company also doesn't have enough techs working every day, meaning customers generally wait an average of 4-10 days before anyone comes out to repair (and that's if they show up and are on time). Insurance coverage also declined but the cost increased. I went the doctor for cold symptoms that wouldn't go away for a week and owed $80, which is $5 less than my uninsured relative pays for the same. My specialist used to cost me $65-70 out of pocket and this past year went up to $130. Combining the stress of the job, the low morale, low pay, crappy insurance, and no light at the end of the tunnel makes a perfect mix for employees to hightail it out of there.

Sun May 12 2019, Customer Service,"Johnson City, TN",Current Employee ,No career here-- unless you are upper management,3,"Great affordable benefits, work with good team members, and usually even your supervisors will do what they can to help you succeed. A good start to get experience. PTO, sick days allow for amazing ability to have a nice work life balance, and there are health programs to help you stay healthy that the company pays for and *pays you* for if you participate.
","In the big picture, this company is in decline. They are downsizing and going over 'metrics' cutting or moving departments- putting poorly trained people in the place of more experienced reps to further cut costs. - Click to chat jobs are being outsourced to other companies in other countries. Also customer care, and retention. -These call centers to do not reflect CTL values. (Not to mention not having enough techs in many areas, so they are using contractors in areas of the country- some are better than CTL techs, some are not.)
I was part of the a support team that helped fix all the broken orders, we were elites in our field. -- Then corporate decided that they were going to move that department to Monroe LA, and everyone in these departments in 2 call centers lost their jobs- but weren't offered anything but a demotion so no *unemployment* would need to be payed. So they moved us to customer care-- Pays were cut, moral was low, the career path and stability was removed for all of us.--- You will never have a career here--- This company now only offers jobs, and you will fill that job. There is no 'department' to aspire to get to, or a real career. Only real jobs that have stability and a career path are in Monroe, LA if you are going to do call center work.
Advice to Management
Create a good company in the United states. Bring back outsourced jobs besides the 24 hour tech support. The vendor companies don't care about CTL customers, because they just are looking for a sale and to be paid by CTL. Change this- also move away from needing government grants and assistance. STOP expanding and focus on building a better infrastructure. Don't move a department unless you actually know what they are doing beyond a metrics report.

","Layoffs. It's something that happens at most companies, but it got to a point where I never knew if I'd have a job in the next 6 months or not. Perhaps I just came in at a bad time.

Less employee focused than it used to be. The CEO has a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. He just seems like he cares more about business than employees, like he doesn't have a heart sometimes. I heard he took away some perks to save money.. small perks, but still. Again, I ""heard"" that. It could just be rumor

Business over employee attitude seemed to be very prevalent in my management chain as well. I had good managers, but we reorg'd so many times that I eventually started getting some duds. VP and management making promises for our team that are super unrealistic to keep and expecting us to work ridiculous hours everyday, every weekend... for no reason. I again, would like to emphasize that this was my personal experience, but I think it's a bad sign that my management and my CEO seemed to have similar attitudes. There is great management at CenturyLink, but since of my personal experience was just awful. 

Excessive reorg makes it unnecessarily more difficult to move up, because it's like you have to start all over with each new manager/VP to prove that you do good work and be in good standing with them. 

My initial experience was much better and I would have given a higher reading in the past. But my last experience us the most recent and left a lasting impression on me.

","Biggest Con THEY DO NOT PAY YOU YOUR COMMISSIONS. They come up with all kinds of excuses that they weren't able to calculate it correctly, do to their system or . . . They are behind 6 months in paying them out. Also started out with no cap on commissions and once people started to make decent sales they capped your commission. So if you sold over a certain amount you don't get paid it, all the while the company is making that money month after month from the customer. They are very unethical in most of their practices and HR is no where to be found, there's an ethics hot line to call but goes on deaf ears. People have had money stolen out of their purses and NO ONE does anything about it. The building is full of rats and cockroaches, just over all really dirty and VERY out dated. And seriously I have never worked for a large corporation that didn't provide free coffee, seriously. This is a call center gig it's not sales your tied down to the phone, they want you to sell anything you can even if your able to provide the customer with a lower monthly bill it's discourage to never do that. A lot of customers are bundled wrong just so the sales person can get a larger sale. I'd say at least 2 people a week quit or they get fired cause they didn't make quota for the month. They have sales training on a regular basis just to back fill all that leave. Most of friends with management so if you apply to another department don't plan on getting it unless you know the manager. 
 CenturyLink is the most unethical place I have ever worked. Don't do it . . .

","A novel could be written about Centurylink post-Level 3 acquisition, and it's extremely important to delineate between Centurylink pre and post-merger. While Centurylink prior to acquiring Level 3 certainly had it's fair share of issues, post-acquisition is an entirely new ballgame and it's not pretty. Former Centurylink Executive leadership has been replaced by L3 execs, processes, and procedures. The actual entire culture has changed. You actually really have to admire how this was all done. 


-Have your debt-laden company acquired by another. 
-Advertise a plan of succession of the acquiring company's leadership. -Proceed to rapidly accelerate that plan, remove nearly all remnants of the acquiring company's leadership in addition to slashing said company's workforce across the board, replace with acquired company's leadership, and VOILA! Mission accomplished. You now get to continue operating as the same company you were before, but now with the added benefit of a much higher brand awareness with the Centurylink name. One doesn't need to look very far to see the results of this. 25 year stock low, slashed dividends, increasing investor frustration and skepticism. 

As others have noted and is evident by looking at Wall Street, this is a company in trouble. Catastrophic failures are occurring in every facet of daily operations. 

-An aloof, arrogant, and tone-deaf Executive Management team that is unaware or unwilling to understand critical issues to the business.

- A middle management layer that has neither the power or the appetite to drive critical change and improvements to the business model and associated processes. Protect your gig at all costs.

- A shocking lack of communication between key departments of the company that are critical to operations and implementation. 

-Continual customer-impacting ""modifications"", changes, and discontinuations of previous processes and systems, with little to no advance notice, training, or explanation. As a result, employees are left to pick up the pieces and institute damage control after the fact.

-A work environment that has become vindictive, unaccountable, and negative. ""One Company, One Culture""....the facade isn't working, guys.

The common thread among all these points is zero accountability for failures in process, strategy, or implementation. ""Not my job"", ""that's a function of____"", ""we'll need to get XYZ approval for this, ""XYZ: that's not something I can do"". This is a common daily refrain at the company now. 

As best as anyone can tell, leadership ""strategy"" now consists of automation, total austerity at the expense of near and long term success, and slash and burn (but only on the Centurylink side, you see). 

Salespeople: 

-Do you like doing being successful at your job (finding/selling/managing business) only to spend 80% of your time on process, administration, implementation, and other assorted roadblocks? 

-If your work somehow makes it through the process gauntlet, do you enjoy navigating multiple, disconnected, archaic systems just to try and track down your pay, only to often find errors in reporting and finance? 

-Do you like being held to account for your quota, while simultaneously having your performance negatively impacted daily due to incompetence and broken processes and systems, only to see leadership of said processes and systems still remain in place even after years of repeated failures, unfulfilled promises and lack of quantifiable improvements?

If so, this is the place for you! If not, stay far away from this place.
Advice to Management
Plenty has already been said about management-this is a group that is clearly in over their heads. No amount of finger pointing, deflection, and blame-shifting about ""legacy products/systems"" (ie Centurylink) can distract from the fact that you own it, you run it, and the results have been clear. Wall Street doesn't lie and neither do your employees.

Hopefully the board of directors can realize their errors in this process and turn the ship around, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

","After working nearly 6 years for Centurylink I can say it is in steep decline. 
-Each process is a comedy of errors, extremely contradictory, doesn't work, is poorly executed, has no training included when rolled out, and not even a semblance of accountability when things go wrong.

-The CEO and the VP's of the sales organization do not know what they are doing and are not showing any interest in improving the motivation, energy, and roadblocks to sales success. There is an extreme air of arrogance that taints them, and it shows with the stock reaching the lowest level in 25 years and most of the top sales talent has fled the company!

-Many critically important systems are continually made worse by some random department that is trying to justify their job. They try to replace something that is working perfectly fine. If it's not broke, don't fix it!

-Compensation is a complete and utter disaster. As a high performing sales rep each year I deserve to get paid what i'm worth. The current CEO and leadership does not believe in compensating you a fair salary or commission, thus it's a disaster. The compensation plan has taken a major and game changing turn for the worse in 2019, but in 2018 it was far worse than previous years as well.
**Additionally** There is constant and big mistakes made on commissions where they do not pay you for the sale you made because the bad sales reporting systems do not pick up the sale, thus causing you to wait months longer to get paid what you earned and having to waste a lot of time and energy trying to correct the problem, since they will not proactively do it for you!

-Note of extreme caution to any talented seller thinking about joining the company: I have far exceeded my quota each year I've been with Centurylink and they have not given me a salary raise in over two years and the CEO Jeff Storey announced himself that he doesn't believe in merit raises or even bonuses! how insulting is that?

-Customer service is beyond horrendous--The customers do in fact have a right to complain, and it's far worse than even they think. I have constantly witnesses extremely incompetent service by project coordinators, customer service, billing departments, and other sales teams that dramatically undercut any claims this company has of excellence or values. Internal sales employees can't even get straight answers from order entry and install teams. It's a complete joke and it's baffling how this company is even in operation at this point.(seriously)

-Management, whether intentionally or not, engages in gaslighting. There is constant twists and distortions in reality. We are told one thing and then within an hour the same thing is refuted or proven to be untrue by another manager or department, and are threatened if you don't follow a debunked policy or rule.

-There is definite and noticeable change in energy in the last year that is pessimistic, negative, and de-motivational for the sales organization. Everyone knows it, but not one leader anywhere is doing anything to address it. Total abdication of leadership and responsibility. It's almost as if they're intentionally trying to get people to resign en-masse.
Advice to Management
The CEO, CFO, and most of the Level 3 sales VP's must resign. You are part of problem, and you must realize the majority of people at Centurylink do not like you and do not approve of you or the job you're doing.

Get rid of middle management. A manager of 2 or 3 people is not necessary. They are normally new to management and slow down the process because of it. The staff is seasoned and talented, so let them do their jobs. The systems are manual, cumbersome, and people are leaving due to lack of autonomy, better comp, and top heavy management model.

","There were several. First off, our floor was extremely unsanitary. They didn't empty our trash cans except maybe every other week, forcing us to literally work in and around piles of garbage 90% of the time, it gave the whole floor a nasty smell. There was mold on the ceiling tiles that after I reported it to my boss and HR nothing was done to replace them. As of the day that I left the toilets had been busted on our floor for 2 weeks straight, leaving a disgusting sewage smell in the hallway leading to our cubicles. They simply weren't willing to invest any money into our floor or department. On top of those issues getting worse and worse, they weren't paying people the commission checks they deserved. Retention hadn't been paid out for 2018, let alone 2019. SOV checks were 3 months behind and generally much smaller than they were supposed to be. They treated outbound CRIS like absolute garbage, and it smelled like it too.
Advice to Management
You guys need to get yourselves together. Either invest in making the floor a safe space to work in OR make this role a work-from-home role. I could make calls from home just as easy as I could from your smelly, disgusting call center. Actually consider sanitary complaints that employees make instead of just smirking and saying ""that's how it is"" and prancing away.

","Theres too many to start. They hire 90% of their employees overseas. There is almost no training, so add both someone who knows no english and has no training and that's what you get every single time you call another department. The pay is absolutely horrible for what you have to put up. They cut your spliffs and your pay every month. You get yelled at all day for not being under 3 mins per call when you can't get assistance on helping someone. Imagine being at a job where you feel trapped; getting yelled at by your manager who doesnt know how to help you, while the customer is mad? Then multiply that by 8 hours. The pressure they put on you for sales is beyond humiliating. You get told you need to go home and tell your family you failed at your job because you forgot to offer a home phone to someone who told you how much they hate CenturyLink. There is no opportunity for advancement. They cut jobs sporadically so your job is never safe.

Promoting current Field Techs into OPS management that have no business managing people because they could never manage their own workload and or provide customer service just arguing with their previous supervisor / manager Im going home you can't force me to work, no one is forcing you just need finish the task your currently working so the customer has service today, I feel sick Im going home Union Field Tech. Accountability for managers that do not meet their goals a complete joke within business operations just ask a few of their business customers getting slimmer by the day. The business sales team can never be trusted Lucky Dragon was a perfect example total sales masterminds that are incompetent and hostile. Even when you try to save them from themselves daily. 
Unifying Principles are a total joke in NEVADA, I cannot speak to other states.

","You have to fight for much of your commission. Sales accounting is horrible.

There are no internal rules of customer engagement, so other sales reps inside CenturyLink are calling into your accounts offering cheaper products and undercutting your revenue. This affects your paycheck.

The company's marketing arm is out of control. Customers get spammed so much that your legitimate attempts to contact them get tuned out, making it harder to sell to your own account base. This affects your paycheck.

CenturyLink has been hoodwinked by an auto-dialing firm into turning their inside sales offices into call centers. You are forced into spending a portion of each day calling a set list of customers. The problem is the list is mostly the lower tier customers and loaded with bad data. Time would be much better spent calling real legitimate opportunities. This affects your paycheck.

Customer Care Managers, tasked with overseeing installations, are underpaid and overworked. They are also largely incompetent. The orders you place for your customers get ignored for weeks. CCMs don't return customer calls, either out of fear or lack of time. Mistakes are common. Orders get cancelled because timelines are not met. CenturyLink knows about this. They do nothing to fix it. This affects your paycheck.

Turnover in the company is out of control. They can't hire people fast enough. Training is largely non-existent. Morale is in the tank. There whole place is a dumpster fire burning out of control.

Fri Oct 19 2018, Senior Network Engineer,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,There is an inherent money issue with retaining talent.,2,"Work-Life Balance, FTO (No set PTO - take as many days as needed with approval), Bonuses.
","HR reps to teams do a dog-&-pony show when asked about opening up budgets to retain talent. They know that they pay WELL below market value for all talent. The HR reps don't bat an eye when they lie to our face about it. They say 'non-direct payment (like bonuses and benefits) keep us at market level' with not even as much as a blush. It's robotic. It's embarrassing. 

CTL wants to be the network leader in services to small to large businesses, but will not open the wallet to retain talent. I've personally seen a team go from 15 people to 5 losing all tenured engineers and not give a raise to anyone that's keeping the team floating interested or around. They're systematically 'letting it go'. In 5 years there's been 1 raise and it was 3% - just enough to keep up with inflation for that year, even if you meet all your requirements of your job duties, even if you go WELL above and beyond because you know no one else will do it. 

Senior engineers get job offers from other competitors ranging from 115-130k which is equal to and above double what they pay our talent, and some management 100% goes to bat for them when faced with another person leaving, but falls short because finance/HR won't budge - or the counter-offer is 10% lower.

There is an inherent money issue with retaining talent - and this has unfortunate consequences. I've seen wonderful engineers move to different companies over and over again because they pay actual market value for talent. 

I'll see them soon myself.
Advice to Management
You're losing talent at an accelerated rate by 1. Hiring off-shore talent that we train and are incapable of network operations to keep costs down, 2. not promoting individuals, which generates a positive environment, 3. Adding senior level workloads to engineers who are still ideologically sound about working hard to get a raise - but it never comes.

The new CTL is all about team effort, but just below the kool-aid culture and value surface is a lot of people with resentment who know they're getting fleeced every year because you want to keep costs down. Maybe they'll start calling people to come back after it's too late? Maybe it'll be too late.
