- Good facilities (plenty of parking)
- Excellent co-workers!
","Non-competitive salaries. With 5+ years of experience you have so many places to work in the area. Plenty competitors offering higher salaries for less responsibility. We've lost several top performers on our team due to this, when we wanted to counter to keep them around we were capped far too low. Once we were able to match but the now former employee wanted to leave because ""it was like pulling teeth"" to get a proper pay increase with Cigna.

Certain benefits that helped give Cigna a slight way to stand out, like education reimbursement for example, have been reduced massively.

Other problems is the health insurance itself, it's very expensive. You'd think working for the company we'd be given a discount, you'd be very wrong.

*Hot button issue* but worth stating that regarding ""Diversity & Inclusion"". Oh... they're very ""accepting"", just don't you dare have a different opinion about anything they deem holy. I'm not remotely a conservative or ""on the right"" even a little but even I know there is an openly hostile environment towards them. You can chant left-wing slogans, most of which I fully support (out of work), but you'll be immediately in trouble if you even mention you agree with a mainstream Republican viewpoint. It's highly toxic and very troubling, again this coming from a liberal... I cannot imagine how truly miserable it must be for conservatives to work for Cigna. We've alienated tons of awesome people due to the overt left-wing pandering.
Advice to Management
Keep pace with the competition! It's so difficult to keep an experienced analyst when we're paying 40-50k less than the competition. On top of that, we often have superb people we'd like to promote internally but their salary increase will be capped.

Stop the left-wing political pandering (coming from a left-wing feminist liberal), we're alienating tons of excellent workers. Just stop the political talk all together, please! Promoting or hiring people based on race or gender is highly immoral, yet Cigna is doing that constantly. They routinely talk about how they're only looking to hire and promote people of color & women. I'm a woman and it's so insulting to assume I (or anyone) would need this handicap. Promote & hire based on ability & professional qualification only please! If they're qualified for the job that's where it should start & end, NOT a candidate's skin color or sex!

Be realistic with the load of work given to your employees and stop threatening write ups and expect perfect work. When you overload and micromanage your employees and don’t pay a living wage.

The culture is negative and caused so much stress. More so than was needed. There was favoritism for moving up. When you have vacation it’s a nightmare. There isn’t real vacation with all the work that gets piled up. You come back to deal with even more stress than when you left. IT’S HEINOUS!

-FDP over pays its members for the roles they have available
-Low expectations -> probably only have to be productive 60% of the day to go above and beyond expectations
-Job security -> nearly a recession proof industry
","-FDP program is mediocre. They assign you to roles beneath your performance ability level. You will become bored... fast.
-Expensive and poor employee health care “benefits”, which is ironic given Cigna’s a health insurance company
-stock based comp is unfortunate given the underperformance of Cordani and leadership relative to peers the past 5 years
-Executive leadership is hypocritical -> they will cut your raise as they prepare for bumpy fiscal years, but will give themselves hefty raises. They’ll through in something to “make up for it” as their way of saying they value their employees

Wed Oct 14 2020, LTD Claim Manager,"Pittsburgh, PA",Current Employee ,Interesting work but workload is unmanageable.,4,"Pros include getting to learn about several disabling conditions, work from home lessens travel time, paid team outings to fun places, nice coworkers. Pay & PTO initially seem like pros as well but you soon find out why they aren’t pros.
","Mgmt says goal is for each ongoing claim manager to have 107 claimants or less, yet we consistently have about 170 claimants, which is arguably enough work for two jobs yet you’re being paid for one job. It’s impossible to keep up & you’re constantly expected to be under x amount of tasks on a weekly basis no matter how many new claims you get. Mgmt openly admits you have too much work on your plate but doesn’t do anything to improve processes or appropriately manage their expectations. They say it frustrates them as well but act as if they have no say so in the matter. You get ample PTO but there is no backup person keeping up on the claims when you take PTO, so taking any time off puts you significantly behind even if you just take one or two day’s off, & then you’re either expected to work a ton of overtime before or after you take PTO to catch up. So there’s ample PTO but using it only makes work harder to keep up with. The salary seems great at first but you often work 50 hours a week on a regular basis just to meet the task requirements & then realize the salary isn’t that great after all, even with overtime pay. Not much work life balance at all, especially if you have kids. Also, while they hire you on at what seems like a good salary, the raises aren’t that great from what tenured employees say.
Advice to Management
Instead of expecting your employees to run themselves ragged on a regular basis trying to manage a workload that’s meant for two people, you need to manage your expectations appropriately. You admit openly that the workload is astronomical but instead of hiring on more ppl to evenly distribute claims, you pile it on your existing employees & you keep saying we have to be under 20 tasks per week whether we have 70 claims or 170 claims. That’s unreasonable. There’s only so many hours in the day & we get tired of working 6 days a week every week to meet unreasonable demands. Hire more people or improve your claim processes somehow but stop expecting us to be tethered to our desks to make up for processes you refuse to update & improve.

-Company spends a lot of time and money to ensure you know what you are doing (Training Programs)

-Somewhat non-collaborative approach between parallel departments and yours (Underwriting)
-A confusing juxtaposition of priorities between departments, creating some sense of dysfunction
-Rotational project work and role progression can be relatively slow, openings are pretty sparse from time to time. 
-Attrition rate leads to many project hand-offs or left unfinished

-Work can be sometimes repetitive and easy to just keep doing past work hours
-Regulations and methodologies change a a lot from quarter to quarter so some people have a strong understanding of procedure while others may be kinda faking it till they make it. Sometimes leads to inconsistent workflows with hand-offs on work.
Advice to Management
Keep listening to employees, keep supporting their professional growth, and open up more lines of communication between upper level and lower level employees. That transparency, when it was done always had a profound and generally positive effect on work processes. Additionally, Subject Matter Experts were always very helpful when new processes and products rolled out. They serve as a strong stop gap before everyone becomes well versed in a new work process.

They continue to give you more and more work. There's not enough time in the day to complete your tasks. There's nothing motivational or exciting anymore.

","It's a churn and burn for unsuspecting employees. The pay is around $20,000 less than similar positions at competitor companies. There is constant chaos and overwork because there are no senior employees because no one stays longer than 4 years. Despite the extreme turnover there is no training or onboarding, and good luck figuring out how to contact Human Resources. They bait and switch candidates during the interview process, telling them that they'll do one thing and then as soon as they start employees are told to do something completely different. Senior leadership has publicly stated that they expect you to put in 50-60 hour weeks. However at the same time, senior leadership looks to front line workers for solutions, not the other way around. Don't expect a promotion for all your hard work either. If you ask for a raise they'll tell you to look externally and will start documenting your performance in painstaking detail so they can begin the termination process for when you inevitably make a mistake amidst all the chaos.

Mon Aug 17 2020, Product Manager,"Saint Louis, MO",Former Employee ,Form Express Scripts,3,"Large Company with benefits and potential for career growth.
With some jobs expect the generous chance to work from home multiple days a week.
","Not all departments are run equally and career growth is dependent on your leadership. After 9+ years I would see careers including my own prosper if the person was luck to have a good leader. If unlucky to have bad or incompetent leader, then even the best employee was passed over for promotions and had to prepare for daily frustration in their job.
 
Even for good employees, if you work there a long time then expect the pay increase from promotions to not match the external market.
Advice to Management
My experience was with Express Scripts for +9 years. I was able to experience multiple mergers and acquiring other companies. In that time I was promoted or took on a new role about every 2-3 years. This allowed me to see different departments and managers. From that experience I can say not all areas of the business are treated the same. 

 I decided to leave in 2019 after they were acquired by Cigna (I only worked under Cigna for about 6 months, and did not see major changes during that time). The major reason for leaving was due to pay.

With my multiple promotions, I learned the company was willing to pay a new hire off the street more than someone that had just promoted internally. HR will say each role has a range based on experience, education, etc. 
 But they also consider the percentage increase when the new role is an internal promotion. 

Because of this decision, the company could have two employees with the same job but the internal candidate is pay less than the new hire. Often the internal employee was faster at acclamation to the new role. They did not need time to learning the company culture or obtain access to programs and systems. But for the pay system, that did not matter as the decision was made during the hiring/promotion phase and not 3-6 months after the person was in the role. 

My direct leadership understood this was a problem, but could only make up for it during annual reviews. On paper I was a stretch employee, but due to additional red tape the leadership was limited by HR on the max percentage an employee's pay could increased each year. I am sure some would argue that better leadership would have found a way, but that gets back to each department is not equal from my experience.

I calculated the difference in my case and found it would take 3-4 additional years with the maxed percentage before I would be even with my peers. That would not make up the time and interest lost, and it did not take into consideration the potential to be promoted and restart the clock.

The fact that my leaders knew this was a problem but HR was unwilling to adjust their policy lead me to look outside the company. I liked what I was doing, and the people I worked with. In this case, I learned getting a year outside and coming back into the company would be a better financial move personally than trying to be promoted internally.

","There is no support for CSRs, who are left to clean up the messes of other departments who do not pull their weight. It’s stressful, chaotic, and overwhelming. Customers are constantly angry because other departments of the company have dropped the ball with them, leaving customers in a catastrophic mess of their own. Raises are so low it’s almost insulting. Training is a joke they doesn’t even cover the accurate scope of the job, so once you’re finally taking calls, you’re constantly being reprimanded for things you never learned or were never made aware of. Supervisors are hit or miss, usually a miss. The person in charge of this circus should consider an overhaul if he wants a sustainable branch. PTO isn’t really generous once you realize that sick time and vacation time come out of the same pool with insane limitations.

","Cigna merged with a well known PBM and it was disastrous before and after. Leadership cares Nothing about their employees, benefits were the WORST I’ve ever had! I worked under the most racist discriminatory manager, Director and peers. Instead of spending time to work with associates and properly coach people , our manager told us to fire people and make sure we did under a certain classification so that she could fight their unemployment. My particular department promoted people based on who they liked and not on merit and it showed. The work environment was extremely toxic, a very high percentage of associates would take a leave of absence for stress related illness within a year of working for the company. The organization I worked for did not have an HR department or a Training and Development department so HR related issues and training fell on the supervisors or mildly tenure associates (associates with the company 1-3 years) which led to the supervisors being overworked and underpaid. The senior manager was not a leader at all and only cared about herself and spent a majority of her day focused on building her dream home and planning her wedding instead of interacting with her associates. She was rude and would barely speak to people if and when she was in the office. Other people on the leadership team would purposely try to set traps for black employees to write them up and terminate them. I can’t speak for other locations, but I’d steer clear of the Indianapolis, IN location especially if you value your mental sanity.
Advice to Management
There are some parts of the organization you guys need to look at “cleaning house” that are in manager and director roles. There is nothing but out of touch Anglo white people(especially men)in leadership roles that don’t know how or refuse to interact with people outside of their comfort zone. Diversity and Inclusion is non existent and if you speak up regarding injustices and mistreatments, especially toward black employees, you are retaliated against. The organization I worked for does NOT exhibit true leadership skills and drama plagued that organization. There was a very high number of black employees whether on an associate level or leadership level that get relieved of their duties. I think you all need to look closely at bringing an HR department on site and investigating certain leaders. I hope that the new VP can help clean some stuff up.

Sun May 17 2020, Resource Planner,,Current Employee ,Been with the company almost a decade,0,"Management- personally I’ve been very fortunate to have great leadership at this company 
Educational Reimbursement- great programs some even pay 100% full tuition no out of pocket at all
401k- matches 6%
Pto- 180 hrs a year you use to get 5 days extra every 5 years up to 20 but they discontinued that 
Work life balance- working remotely with a very flexible schedule (varies by department)
","Insurance- if you have a family it’s very costly and takes an EXTREMELY hard hit on your paycheck this can make life a bit hard especially if you are a 1 income household and the deductibles are pretty high just recently after 10yrs I’ve seen them change to a copay plan but the premiums are still costly for families
-My biggest ISSUE (PAY) after comparing other companies and what I do now I’m paid wayyy below market value this is complaint of a lot of other employees also and they usually quit and come back but are offered much better salaries or hourly pay when coming from the outside again. To give you an example the from line customer service reps start at $16 no experience customer service for BOA starts at $20 am hour no experience 4 dollars is huge in this economy so I would say this is the biggest issue with the company that I see. For myself personally I don’t qualify for homes in my area and would have to settle to put my children in less fortunate areas and schools districts if I purchase with the income I currently make.
Some departments are a dead end with no opportunities for growth

","Medical plans - Cigna utilizes healthcare 'incentives' to reduce overall employee medical plan costs. The 'incentives' are in place to encourage employees to take healthy actions. There is a long list of potential incentives. 
Why this is a 'con': Cigna offers medical plans that cost 2-3x more than plans at other similar size companies (the per-pay period medical plan cost subtracted from paycheck). Then they use the incentives to reduce the cost to employee. If an employee does not take advantage of or does not qualify for the healthcare 'incentives', then the medical plan cost is higher than offered at other employers.

Sun Nov 10 2019,Anonymous,"Philadelphia, PA",Current Employee ,This company cares,7,"Cigna is miles ahead in technology and in employee engagement compared with their competitors. The culture isn’t as stuffy as other companies I’ve worked for, they really believe if you take care of your own, they’ll take care of the customer. There isn’t a tool I’ve needed that wasn’t offered to me to do my job well. I’ve also never seen so many senior leaders so accessible to their associates. They have great leadership programs which allow college kids to gain the experience they need to be successful in management later. They also have programs to develop mid-management and senior leadership as well. I’ve been given incredible support to do my job and everyone has been willing to help me. It’s not unusual for people to move around to gain cross functional experience. When people leave positions it’s still usually to stay at the company. Also love that there’s so much flexibility to work from home - a huge plus for working parents. Performance reviews are based on ongoing conversations with management vs a ten page document that you have to write up at the end of the year. It definitely forces you to stay engaged with your leaders on what’s going on. There’s a big emphasis on educating employees around difference between diversity vs inclusion - i appreciate that this company goes deeper than just making the company “look” different. CEO has a huge part in diversifying company and is very active in veteran and military support. Overall I’m really happy here, sure there’s still some typical corporate annoyances but there’s none of the toxic behaviors I saw at my last company. I sit near contractors who are sticking around and not taking other gigs in the hopes of getting fully employed by Cigna one day - that’s a nice testament to their experience.

They can actually pay us what the market is currently showing this position should be paying at the least starting off 50,000. not 40,000 starting off. Managers and team leads are BFF's and enjoy belittling people and making them feel unappreciated. Work load is not crazy but the pay sucks for having a bachelors degree. This company overlook hard working people trying to advance there career, they promote the Caucasian race more than anything.

Advice to Management
Cigna itself is a great company, but the department I worked at isn’t. I’ve been trying to do a schedule change but was not allowed to as there is a “list.” But when I left, they let my friend choose whatever shift he wanted, meaning the shift I wanted and he wasn’t even an employee. I didn’t get a raise due to “conduct” but it was NEVER mentioned to me that I wouldn’t, but I’ve been working really hard to help leadership. Basically, my manager told me I wasn’t worth fighting for raises even though they recognize my hard work. I’ve been trying to contact the person that does our payroll regarding my last check, but she hasn’t gotten back to me. Instead, I had to call Employee Services again and ask them to call my team leader. It’s been MORE than a month since I left Cigna. It’s not hard to pick up the phone and have Employee Services change my term date. Especially since I’ve contacted my manager numerous of times. Most employees/consultant in my department will tell you, some of the management has favorites that they will try to push and help for but not for everyone. It’s all lies in that department and it’s really upsetting especially since I’ve been there for almost 4 years!

","This was by far, the worst job I’ve ever had. The training is not adequate and is very unorganized. The trainers/skill coaches are not very knowledgeable. Despite receiving terrible training, if management feels as if you are not performing as they “feel” you should be, they will terminate you in a heartbeat. People continue to get fired or resign while the workload continues to increase but they refuse to hire more people. Claim managers are undervalued, underpaid and simply unappreciated. It is a highly stressful environment with unrealistic expectations. This is not a 40 hour work week job; more like a 60 hour work week is needed to get the job done. There is little to no support from Seniors, Team Leaders and Directors. You can bend over backwards for this department and still not get a raise and will most certainly get overlooked for any promotions. There is no consistency with management; what you will get from them all depends on what day it is. Sometimes they feel like a nut and sometimes they don’t.
Advice to Management
Stop blaming claim managers for what is really a problem in the management and structure. What do you expect to happen when the department is short staffed, processes are not clear and employees are overworked and don’t feel appreciated? Nothing good will come from this department until the structure is changed and workers are compensated and acknowledged for the hard work that they put in. To be honest, current upper management needs to be wiped completely out and replaced with more knowledgeable and qualified individuals.

Approves of CEO
I have been working at Cigna full-time for more than a year
Pros
Work life balance here is great - a lot of opportunities to work from home if needed, and it seems like they are expanding remote working overall. Having a gym in the office is pretty nice as well.

Management is pretty friendly generally, as well as those in other departments that I work with personally. Company culture and mission are much better in my opinion compared to most other companies within the industry save maybe Kaiser.
Cons
Although the company encourages you to apply for new internal positions to push your career forward, they still tend to take external employees more often (at least from what I have seen). Anecdotally this may be due to my length of employment, but I was made to understand you should be trying to expand your career here within 2 years if not sooner, so it is a little disheartening to say the least.

Pay at the level I am at and even one tier above is pretty poor in comparison to the rest of the industry... we have been told by internal analysts that we are being paid significantly less than we should be based on market research. The company is 'attempting' to rectify this, but after revealing this information, morale is low, turnover has become high in what was already a high-turnover department, and those who remain are being shunted extra work with no incentives to do better.
Advice to Management
From what I have seen, management is good in terms of listening to employee issues. I think the problem lies with the management level above that... there seems to be resistance to paying people more, which is causing erosion in the quality of work at the mid tier and lower levels, as well as massive dropoffs as employees leave to be paid much higher for the same work at other healthcare companies. Cigna has good training, so headhunting was already common - if they don't do something soon, there may be significant loss in terms of efficiency due to turnover, which will ultimately affect profit.

","Once I became to sick to work. Having to go on std & Ltd (that I paid for...) was nearly impossible. I had 5 doctors telling them I could no longer work due to extent of my disability. But the company’s short term & long term disability management firm was useless. Also even tho I paid for LTD as one of my benefits. They quit compensating me once I got approved for SSD which left me with a big disparity between what I made while working and even the lesser amount I made on LTD I still went from while working making at the time (2006) $40-60k per year depending on OT, on LTD to $22k and on SSD I now only make $14-$15k. The least the Ltd that I paid a premium for should’ve done is paid the diff between the $14k and the $22k - with medicines and all it’s very hard to survive on just an SSD income. My meds alone cost me between $3-$400 month. So if someone had to pay rent or a house payment, utilities, car payment, insurance etc out of that... one couldn’t live. Thankfully I had been blessed and paid house off b4 I got sick and I drive older cars (when or if I get out...) so - no extra payments.

","Terrible health insurance, nothing but high premiums and high copays. Some jobs are being outsourced, but there was a hold up, so some of us are still employed while they finish training our replacements. Management in several departments is largely incompetent and very cliquish, mostly because this division of Cigna is made up of very small insurance companies that were bought out, so you have a management staff that is old and outdated, many of whom cannot even use any software programs with any level of proficiency. They generally just gossip and do things the way they have been doing it for 10 or 20 plus years.

Wed Dec 26 2018, Customer Service Advocate,,Current Employee ,So much wasted potential,0,"Pay is decent- shift differential pending the hours you work. 80 hours of PTO -opportunity to buy more after a period of time. The company is open 24/7 so there’s multiple shifts to be worked- mine consistently had Sundays off and one Saturday a month (off a week day if you worked a Saturday) Work at home opportunity. Casual dress code, only had to dress business casual if clients were coming in (1-2 times a week if that) You learn more about insurance than you ever thought possible. OT opportunity almost all year long, but more so between Nov-Feb
","The medical benefit packages are embarrassing. The “best” plan is 1600 deductible for a single person and 3750 out of pocket. Would be nice to have a copay plan or at least a lower deductible . Adherence- they claim it’s not as big of a deal if you’re taking care of the customer. They want you to be customer centric and not let the customer have “homework” but then take away all of your resources to do that. Supervisors are completely unorganized and training is subpar. Websites/programs are constantly crashing- probably wouldn’t be any issue if there wasn’t so many repetitive systems we have to use. A lot of systems feed into each other- but one of them is usually wrong or doesn’t show you a simple piece of information you need so you have to go through a whole other program to get that one piece of information.
Advice to Management
Understandably policy’s change constantly- but stay consistent in training and reviews. If your team member is truly working hard give them support, this work environment should be give and take, not to just take from us all the time. We can’t do our job without proper resources-sops, job aids, available coaches, coverage policy’s- and sometimes I think the managers who have been off the phones forget that. Stop trying to keep us quiet when we tell you something isn’t working- we try to voice our concerns and you come back with a very blank answer instead of actually addressing the issues.

","Upper management seems constantly flip-flopping between if something requires pre-auth or not. One person will give one answer, and then give someone else a completely different answer. You will find yourself working ALL markets, and almost every service type. Each market has different rules, it’s nearly impossible to keep up with, but management doesn’t care. You have to know everything and you better not make a mistake. You get no recognition for a job well done. The letters you have to send out for different markets need different fax cover sheets in different circumstances, so you better remember which one gets which even though you have cases with multiple markets assigned to you. And if a member needs a Spanish letter, we are told to “use Google translate”, as most of us don’t know Spanish. If you don’t meet production, for even just 1 month, you get put on an action plan, regardless of if you JUST WENT THROUGH TRAINING on a new process. You may have worked hard for your RN or LPN, but you will also find yourself doing the Customer Service Agents work too, and correcting their mistakes with no repercussions for them. Think twice before applying here.
Advice to Management
Ease up on your expectations; they are unreal, and unattainable. You set your employees up for failure. Get it together with what requires prior auth and what doesn’t. Communicate to the whole team, not just one person. Compliment your employees, reward them. When you lose them due to the lack of remorse, understanding and respect, you will wish you tried to show them that you do care....if you do.

* Their salaries and bonuses are underwhelming

* I would have expected health insurance coverage to be better - nothing was easy or inexpensive about dealing with their insurance or pharmacies and I worked there; I can only imagine how hard it must be for those who don't have recourse within the company

Advice to Management
Until there is a wave of retirements or deaths of the long time entrenched mid to upper level leadership, nobody is going to risk self sacrifice by opting out of their self-created Game of Thrones nonsense and taking a stance because it is the right thing to do. Integrity has been squelched and discouraged, and those coming up behind them are learning at their feet. Massive cultural change would have to be undertaken by the top of the chain, which would have an associated economic cost. In other words, it won’t happen unless and until they find themselves unable to attract or retain sufficient talent willing to be overworked and underpaid in a toxic environment. Egos need to be checked at the door, and leaders need to seek those who disagree with them and find out why, rather than destroying dissenters and promoting only those who would smother their grandmother before they would wipe the phony smile from their face and not reaffirm why your stupid decision is the best thing ever.

Wed Jan 10 2018, Operations Manager,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Honesty is hard to find,4,"Have worked here 9 years and 3 different jobs. I have worked with good and bad people, I’ve had opportunities when I tell people I want them and pursue them myself- no one gives you anything! It’s your career- manage it- don’t expect someone to give you something cause they won’t!
David Cordani is a fantastic leader. 
ELT is also a solid group of leaders.
Many at the top are retiring an team is altering its structure and providing more internal promotions and added responsibility - the believe in building leaders from within- all the way to the top and bottom.
","Hard to get hired in externally at top
Levels because managers promote from within- this is a pro and con, sometimes key strategic hires can enhance the team.
The comp method to allocate changed a couple years ago - but many managers are still ranking and stacking. 
The chiefs have bonus programs
The Indians have few bonus opportunities
Advice to Management
Train your managers on how to give feedback ! Many employees do not get appropriate feedback and think they are doing well - then when como time comes they get ranked at the bottom. Rather than performance managing some people, the standard is to job eliminate the bottom performers as it’s easier. If managers were trained in giving feedback these folks would know where they stand, in some cases improve, and naturally move on themselves.

","""clicky""; very hard to promote if you're not in the click; implements changes to increase efficiency, but doesn't stick with it-take 2 steps forward, 1 step back again; doesn't acknowledge ALL employees for their hard work; doesn't pay what you're worth only based on ""contributions"" you give to team, but does not open up opportunities for everyone to have the same chance for bonuses and/or growth. doesn't have an environment that encourages open discussion of how you are feeling-always the threat of your job or that it would be harder on you if you speak up. for working for an insurance company, our benefits stink-there are employers that offer better coverage than they give their employees.
