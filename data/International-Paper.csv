Thu Jan 14 2021, Buyer,,Current Employee ,Comparatively the best in-class work environment and compensation,0,"This review ONLY applies to the fiber-side of procurement (both in Virgin and Recovered Fiber sectors of the industry):

-Excellent compensation (in the fiber procurement sector) EXCLUDING health insurance 
-They make reasonable accommodations (i.e. work from home) 
-Highly professional culture - low occurrence of low-class/ inappropriate behavior
","-Is overly politicized and fairly easy to commit career suicide - sometimes without even realizing you did! You need to have tact & be familiar with the skills associated with the ""dog & pony show"". A silver tongue w/ a can-do and positive attitude are required for most people to advance to certain levels in the company. Just being good at your job is not in itself enough to soar with this company - you have to develop your soft skills although there have been a few old-school hold-outs that made it pretty far up in the ranks prior to the progressive HR agenda being implemented. Just like ANY OTHER BIG CORPORATION, there are unspoken social rules that are unethical & hypocritical (double-standard) that one must play by in order to advance IN CERTAIN AREAS of the company. Not all areas require these unspoken soft skills to advance consistently. 
-Health Insurance benefits are scant while premiums are high (this may not be a criticism of the company benefits as much as it is a criticism of the current health insurance and medical regulatory environment. Packages are largely unchanged from when I started back in 2012 - but what did change was the premiums doubled between 2012 - 2018 for family while the coverage remained stagnant. Obamacare is to blame for the premiums while IP is to blame for not adapting and remaining competitive by carrying the weight of the premiums - further premium hikes now get passed to the employee. 
-Match pay on 401K is marginal - average is around $.60 on the dollar for the first 8% (it isn't terrible but I've seen considerably better)
Advice to Management
One area of IP that has gotten verifiably worse across the board in recent years is that employees have a low confidence in their ability to be forthright without facing retaliation consequences - such as what I meant by ""career suicide"". We walk on egg shells around certain management levels because those management levels do not exercise criticism about the company in front of us and the atmosphere is one where we do not believe we can be honest, even if the truth is critical to company performance. If you want us to feel comfortable being honest and if you want constructive criticism, you have to kill the ever-growing agenda of political correctness and you need to demonstrate constructive criticism & transparency in front of your team (if you expect us to be transparent).

They claim to care about safety but constantly ask employees to break OSHA regulations.
Advice to Management
Do what you say you are going to do. Respect the people who actually do the job, they likely know more about it than you do. Do not ask any employee to do anything that violates OSHA. If you do not know if it does, ask someone, trust me the production workers will know. Do not work your employees harder than you work yourself.

","After you are established in your career, it's not terribly different than other companies so you see a lot of people jumping ship between 3-10 years.
 
They do not do cost of living adjustments in the mill system to compensate for differences between the middle of Alabama and the West Coast but they do this in the Box Plant system. It make no sense!

The insurance is very expensive and Cigna coverage is not very good. Most people were on spouse's insurance if that was an option. For 2 people I was paying over $700/month! No option for employee+1. 

Still a male dominated industry and not much being done to allow women to succeed long term in the field.

Eventually the arbitrary requirements they have rolled out throughout the company will hinder them from competing with their competitors.

","Business direction is shaky. The division I was in had more turnover (corporate, management and onsite positions) this past year than I have seen in 5 years of working for this company. Corporate is constantly moving their employees around between businesses or location sites. Each corporate leader is looking to implement different standards and goals, so sites keep having to change business direction. Recently there were two projects that were bringing in revenue (and had potential to bring in much more if marketing developed better customer leads) that were ended. During tough fiscal times that the industry is going through, one must wonder why these projects were ended. 

Direct leadership are over worked because they often have their own project work to do, typically manage other people and their careers, as well as continually having to take on new duties since this location is in a hiring freeze but has had several retirements and turnover. They will toe the corporate line and not go to bat for you if it means rocking the boat.

Communication is awful at pretty much every level. Between project managers, scientists and technicians. Between management and everyone else. There is too ambiguity and inconsistency. This in the end can be expensive because if work is done incorrectly, you have wasted hours and materials. Much information has to pass through the rumor mill instead of formal communication to all employees. Creates mistrust and misunderstandings, has been compounded by CoVid-19 while 50-66% of the building are working from home.

Few opportunities for for tangible growth (raises and promotions are far and few between, even for valuable employees/high performers). It is often that you are presented with ""growth and leadership"" opportunities, however, this is their way of adding responsibilities to your job that expand your capabilities but will not be financially compensated for. Sure, you will get the annual raise, but to move through PLs takes promotions. In 5 years, I have only seen 4 promotions. All except one of which were for people that had been there 7-13 years and had been waiting 5-7 of them for a promotion. Bonus program is only available to those at high scientist and management level. 

There are more than a few examples where technicians are doing scientist work yet have not been formally promoted. Those onsite are relied up now more than ever to take care of things that are not their responsibility. CoVid-19 has allowed for many of the scientist and project managers to ""work from home"" and some have become disconnected from the onsite work. For example, there are certain scientist that expect next day or two turn around for their work, just because they decided to finally submit something (because they are coming up against a deadline and realized they need some data to present) when there is work already in process to be completed. 

Clique culture. Most of these employees have worked together for 10+ years and are able to regale you with stories of the ""good old days"". Though most are friendly, I have seen cases of when people just don't fit in and can lead to being black balled out of working in an area or a project. Beware the bullies and steamrollers! If you're into that, manipulation of the ""right"" people will work here. You will find that if you target and befriend highly influential people, it will put you in a position to be treated favorably. Some managers will not evaluate you by your work ethic but instead how you the façade that is presented. 

Instead of productivity and quality in which one completes their work, there is a heavy emphasis on networking and attending all of the non-essential meetings and activities. There is no possible way to do your job successfully and attend everything. People who are in attendance of everything are those who want to 1. avoid their actual work responsibilities, 2. brown nose to the ""right"" people to be noticed. 

Company values (like safety) tend towards being just lip service with no action, particularly if the price tag to upkeep their values is too expensive. The only safety officer onsite had their position eliminated. The nurse that was contracted onsite 3 days a week, no longer is available, instead there is a virtual nurse. Despite having 3 medical incidents onsite within the past year. AND weathering a pandemic. Also, due to the decreased capacity of the building, they are waiting to re-sign their evening custodial service. We have just one (amazing, kind and hard working) custodian during the work hours that covers cleaning and disinfecting the high touch areas AND daily cleaning. Keep in mind that the square footage of the building did not change.

","Worst working hours in the country. You work 7 days on 3rd shift then off for one day, 7 days on 2nd then off for one day, 7 days on first then off for 4 days. You work nights, weekends, holidays. IP refuses to pay bonus holiday pay.
Company preaches safety constantly, but it's all a sham. If there's an accident, the employees are blamed for getting hurt. All of the Safety Observation Cards, where numerous employees reported a safety issue to Management will disappear and the person who got hurt will be thrown under the bus. Management regularly ducks responsibility for inaction, complacency, and outright lies. 
IP hires bargain price college kids for Management positions who dont know the first thing about the jobs and have no idea how to work or talk with men who've been pouring blood, sweat, and tears into tough jobs since the kids were playing in a sandbox.
They hire felons for the tax break, and allow them to be lazy, yet reprimand hard-working employees if they use harsh language. God forbid some lazy idiot gets their feelings hurt after theyve been asked to do simple tasks multiple times in a polite way.
They bleed money through antiquated software, policies and safety procedures. They refuse to entertain fantastic ideas by employees unless they company can screw the employees overbon yet another contract issues.
IP will cut out their eyes to spite their face. 
This was a fantastic place to work and raise a family before IP bought it. The entire company is a cancer now.

","Cater to college recruits (CORE). CORE is spoon fed special assignment and given positions without any experience. December we let IT staff go and then turn around and create Strategic Analyst position for someone with no qualifications and they do not post it. If you are not on the managed move list to get promoted and no one can tell you how to get on the list. Senior leaders routinely are deceptive about their motivation especially in Information Technology. Ethics is something they preach but do not practice. I have had directors and senior managers information technology lie to my face and when you show them your CSA is impacted. If you are long term employee your contribution does not count. Want a prime example, CORE have a budget, they often spend time with VP, Directors, Sr. Managers, etc. They are spoon fed positions. They get training on leadership that long term employees do not get. CORE have little experience and even if you are not accepted into because you do not meet requirements by CORE, a VP or Director can have you put into CORE. Just go look at some of the CORE GPAs.

Lots of locations if you want to move around within the company.
","Company is an old company in an old industry and hasn't had to change much over the years. 
Entrenched unions in most locations - some locations with better relationships and some locations horrid. 
Leadership near the top of the organization (like EHS leadership) are way overkill on micromanaging lower-level leaders. Ability of lower leaders to tailor processes to their facilities so they actually work is stifled. 
So much paperwork and redundant effort to meet corporate requirements that it's hard to actually meet the spoken expectation of being on the floor with your people. Real expectations vs imaginary expectations.
Work/life balance is horrid in many locations. Salaried employees get paid based on 49hr work weeks, but are often expected to work 6-7 days a week in practice - averaging 60-80hrs in many positions. Often-times hourly work the same, but even overtime pay comes at a cost to their personal lives - voluntary or not.
The older-in-age management often have antiquated expectations of work-ethic where your work is your #1 loyalty and you will come in in the middle of the night and every weekend if we tell you to. This has had a widespread effect on company-wide culture. This will not work with younger generations in future decades - company needs to adapt to the times if they want to be successful.

And you shouldn't be surprised when you make your employees work that much and their spouses leave them (not me, but I've seen it) - and you have to own your responsibility in that. You are managers of people. You [do] affect what happens in their lives outside of the plant and it [does] come back to bite you in the plant. I could go on but I'd be writing a book.

","The way they do shift changes is awful. If you’ve been requesting a different shift for months, and some guy who has a week or month of seniority over you and just requests it the day before, he’s gonna get it, not you, because he has a bit more seniority over you.

Paying for union and using their benefits is mandatory

Attendance “point” system is awful for the first 90 days of probation. If you’re throwing up or even coughing up blood and need to call out for a few days, better start looking for a new job.

A lot of “don’t ask? Won’t tell” mentality. You’re almost expected to ask all different kinds of questions because no one will tell you if you don’t ask.

If you’re the new guy, you are literally the runt of your shift. If no one wants to do overtime, either you’ll have to do it or you’ll get a mark on your attendance.

Mon Jul 23 2018, Systems Analyst,,Current Employee ,Been a great place to work (Corporate-IT Staff),2,"Compensation has been very good overall. In my experience here, you get out of International Paper what you put into it. There are negative people here who complain about never getting ahead and such - but in most of those cases, they are overall very negative people and I think that will hamper you here at IP. A positive, ethical mindset and a good work ethic have allowed me to really grow at IP. The opportunity is here for those that are willing to dedicate themselves to the goal. 

At the same time, IP is *excellent* with their work/life balance. None of the other companies I have worked for even come close to IP's concern with your work/life balance. This is one of the things that really goes a LONG way to keeping me at IP.

They also actually send us to training. All companies promise to send IT to training - but in my experience, very few actually make good on this promise. IP has made good on this promise.

Very laid back environment
Excellent Management
Good compensation
Mostly good benefits
Outstanding corporate ethics and morals.
","Large company - easy to get 'lost' in . This can sometimes lead to various team members taking advantage of the situation and not pulling their weight. While this does allow the more ambitious to succeed, it can also be annoying to some of the co-workers at IP.

IT staff is too tightly 'siloed' sometimes. While this does help with focused subject matter expertise, it can also lead to some tension between teams and a lack of understand of the job of peer employees.

At remote sites, career growth is not even possible to a large degree for 'corporate' employees. This is only a minor-con, depending on a person's situation. For those who do wish to move ahead with IP, they are certainly opportunities for those willing to relocate to the HQ in Memphis, TN
Advice to Management
Be more transparent on benefit changes and quit making small changes that are 'under the radar'. 

Give managers more power to enforce company policy in terms of team members not pulling their own weight.

Keep up the good work - IP's management is top notch in my opinion.

","Used to be a good place to work when it wasn't IP! All jobs that could possibly be contracted out were gotten rid of and lower payed, unmotivated contract employees were brought in to replace all of those who lost their jobs! Former employees were given the option of staying as contract employees with less pay and no benefits! The CEO was taking millions of dollars a year in bonuses while average employees were losing their jobs and benefits! NICE WORK IP!
 Managers at the site, (I worked over 20 years at), were unfairly chosen and promoted! Most of them didn't know their job as well as the operators, and didn't even have degrees! 
 If you brown nose and kiss up you can get ahead at IP. Otherwise, if you're simply a good employee, ambitious, punctual, conscientious, etc. but don't ""hang out"", or are related, you won't advance at IP! 
 It's a good place to start your career if you are an engineer. (Low starting pay but good on a resume!) 
 Safety is a low priority with IP! They talk the talk but they definitely don't walk the walk! It's all window dressing! PRODUCTION IS KING! I witnessed people running around like crazy working on equipment without anything being locked out simply because 'this is costing us $50,000 a minute every minute we're down!' And if someone says something about it, they are labeled as a trouble maker and their career at IP is done!

Clean up your act! Recognize employees who want to succeed! Those employees will carry you and make IP a much better company!

REACH program was great for entry level employees to learn about the paper making process, how to conduct yourself in meetings, IP's Project Development Process, and various tools that can go on that resume like SAP.
","I worked at one facility for 4 years and transferred to another thinking I was advancing my career with a new experience. The facility I transferred to was the Franklin VA Mill which had previously been closed. I worked there for a year on several projects to change the facility to a Mill that makes Fluff. I had the worst boss ever. He was to busy to assign me projects so sent me out to hunt for my own. When any project did run into trouble he offered no assistance nor advise. I was treated like a REACH Engineer even though I came in knowing all the tools and demonstrating all the ability to successfully execute projects. I was given no credit for the numerous projects I had completed successfully but given all the credit when a small issue arose, which I fixed as well. I had weekly sit downs with my manager to go over my projects and he still could not tell you what I had done right.

","Compensation is low when you consistently work 60+ hour weeks including the weekend. Was not informed of this when interviewing.

Work life balance? Nope, most workers are senior in age and will lack empathy for younger workers. Turnover is high due to this, which leads to ""No change"" in group thinking.

Coworkers above you give little to no respect to those below as they think of their career first.

A lot of talk and no walk on culture change. IP is facing 30-50% retirement in 10 years but hasn't changed on the workplace culture.

There are some great people working at IP.
","Though the pay scale is commensurate with other companies, getting a promotion is usually very difficult. Like a lot of large companies where employees make good salaries, there is a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the employees about what each other is making. Who tells them? Instead of looking for very talented help and rewarding them for a job well done, they reward mediocrity with their sliding, bell curve based salary determination scale. If an employee has been doing excellent work for numerous years, they may get an increase in salary of up to 5%. (though it is usually between 0 & 1%, like .47% for example.) 
On the other hand, if an employee has been borderline at performing their job for most of their career, and they suddenly do their job, they get rewarded with the maximum 5% increase in salary! Where is the incentive for the high performers to keep producing? It's the proverbial story of the horse pulling the cart and the one tied to the back of the cart. The horse pulling the cart gets whipped if they suddenly let up, but the one following behind the cart doing nothing to help pull the cart, just keeps getting fed, watered and groomed!
Advice to Management
Get rid of the ridiculous Merit pay scale! Start recognizing and rewarding the employees who are actually performing for you. Look in the trenches at the employees who steadily work day to day with no mistakes, no re-work, no problems and reward them.

Promote your talent! Delegate and let your employees perform, and then reward them for their work! 
In the end, you will have more loyal and dedicated employees who will work to make you look better! They will be more cohesive and will not mind going the extra mile to perform a task or job better!

Tue Jul 07 2015, Individual Contributor,"Memphis, TN",Former Employee ,"Probably great environment for aged workers, not necessarily millenials",11,"If you want a place to play it safe with your career, then you've found your match. It's not necessarily an exciting industry but at least you know the company is stable, the pay is decent (not to be confused with fair), you'll get a full range of benefits (not the best, but not the worst either), tuition reimbursement, processes are centralized and automated, and career, learning, leadership training, and travel opportunities exist. If you work at corporate, there are even greater perks such as drawings for attending arena events like NBA games and major concerts or getting classroom projects sent to your child's school like watching butterflies grow or magazine subscriptions.
","I felt like the company bullied Memphis when it threatened to leave the city unless it extended a tax benefit it had been receiving for 20 years. As someone who remembers attending school without air conditioning, that tax revenue from this multi-billion dollar company was greatly missed by the city's school system, yet the company will like to tout its $1-2M charitable donations per year to local organizations. 

After getting it's way and expanding it's HQ, you would think maybe an onsite daycare or pumping rooms would have been included as part of the plan with what more modern-engaged companies are doing, but maybe that's a symptom of the leadership being mainly baby-boomers. 

Also, a lot of the field locations are in the boondocks. So for younger employees, the prospect of spending three or more years of your best years in a place that lacks basic recreation or the potential for finding a partner becomes bleak no matter how much they pay you. 

If you aren't careful, you will notice that IP will slowly, but surely become your life. Meanwhile, piece by piece you will have given up the parts of your life that made you who you are. It's a lot of people there that have spent their entire careers at the company so it's all they know. As a result, if you have an existing, continual commitment in your life that conflicts with work arrangements, these types of employee feel like you just need to give up what it is you've always done before you got there because IP is all that matters and there should be not flexibility on its part. 

At IP, you get sold the mantra of infinite possibilities regarding career opportunities. However, what they don't tell you is that at the end of the day, they will place you where they want you to go when they want you to go there. So that means even if there's an opportunity available for which you qualify, you may not get it because your manager considers you to be non-releasable. There also isn't a whole lot of credence given to your experience gained outside of the company. It's almost as if what you had done before doesn't matter because they didn't see you do it there.
Advice to Management
A lot of the management is from the baby-boom era and tend to view the VPN as more of something you use to get more work done at home after you've been at work all day or to slave your weekends away. Instead they should be leveraging it as an option to allow those who want to primarily work for home to do so. They have all of the technology available that a non-customer interacting employee should be able to work from Rwanda everyday if they wanted to. It doesn't do any good to hire younger workers if you want them to conform to antiquated business practices. Unlike the people you hired 30+ years ago who are committed to the company, these millenials are committed to their careers. Those two things can align if the company gets it right; otherwise, the new talent will choose themselves over you, re-opening that knowledge vacuum you're trying to close.

Mon Jun 08 2015,N/A,"Memphis, TN","Developer in Memphis, TN",Resonable company horrible city,3,"IP calls its Technical Support Staff ITCS. I worked for the manufacturing division which is very laid back. We had some general flex time as long as staff was in the office from 7-6. This meant that some of us came in from 6-3 and others 9-6. it was very nice and no questions were ever asked provided you were productive. The company is very respectful and open minded to solutions I had many opportunities to utilize my specialize to create innovative solutions that were out of the box for IP at the time. It isn't the most bleeding edge work in the world, but I found my time there very relaxing unless a critical problem arose and I was always given plenty of compensation for over-time

This is a great company to work for long term. Lots of movement potential and ability to work all over the world if you move towards management and financials.
","IP is a very large very old company. I can't complain enough about the entrenchment that goes on in management. The problem with ITCS is that they are a cost center for the manufacturing decision they work and even though they pretend to have a chain of command I can't count the times a Division manager went around 3 levels of management to talk directly to me about a problem. 

I was always very uncomfortable in this situation, not because I couldn't handle the pressure from engineering, but because I would regularly get told by my own bosses not to directly speak to these individuals. I found the management on my side to over react to small complication instead of seeking advise from those actually aware of the circumstance.

As a large corp you will be subjected to what ever management buzz course is being forced on your team for the year. Be prepared to enter the world of office space when dealing with them directly. This may be worse now that ITCS has moved across the street from Corp HQ.

Fri Oct 17 2014, SAP BW Developer,"Memphis, TN",Former Employee ,"Solid company, solid people, reasonable expectations",4,"(For the IT org): Really solid training opportunities, good onboarding, good company culture, truly decent and basically good colleagues. The comp, benefits, vacation, etc., are fairly standard. Start before New Years, and you'll pick up nearly a full year toward your vacation increase at 5 years (effectively waiting only 4 years to get that extra week off). IP is a steady and predictable employer, and managers generally do their best to ensure a happy, healthy workforce. If you're willing to go out on the limb, branch out and learn a new position, you will usually be encouraged. They're big enough to absorb your vacancy, meaning you're usually 'releasable' to another manager for internal moves, and standouts are recognized. Shared Services model in IT allows if not encourages cross-pollination and syntopical learning. You can be silo'd if you choose to be, or you can float positions every couple of years if you like. It is unlikely that a solid worker would be downsized, as efforts are made to retain 'people', not just positions. I had an excellent experience at IP, and would return w/o hesitation if the circumstances making that feasible arose.
","If you really dig in and stick to a particular specialty, then advancement can be slow. In big, stable companies, many other employees realize when they have it good as well, so without standout performance or a few lateral moves (to round out technical and business experience), advancement might take a while.
IF an individual thrives in a churning environment, then a smaller company with less process and planning might be preferred. The truly restless acheiver might feel stagnate, but again, a change of position and new learning is one way to keep things interesting w/o changing companies. IP is big enough to sustain some employee drift within the organization. If I had it to do over, I would have 'drifted' through more roles.
Advice to Management
I felt I was truly well-managed, so the only things to note is that the culture of stability does discourage innovation to some degree (doing the necessary overshadows it), and compensation levels arguably reflect a trade-off between that stability and higher rates. Since Memphis is 'cheap' compared to a lot of IT markets, the local market rates discourage infusion of new blood. I would recommend Recruiting/HR/Managers take some long shots by focusing on some brand-name schools in addition to the usual suspects. It would be a long-term win for IP and the Memphis, TN community in general to infuse more top-tier graduates.

Wed May 14 2014, IT Analyst,,Current Employee ,Great company for it's size,1,"Pay is very competitive overall. While I might be able to make more 'cash' at some other places, it wouldn't make up for the stability that IP has offered me, along with the total benefits package. Their Retirement plans are good, health benefits are decent, and there are many other benefits outside of these realms. I have actually gotten training, whereas many companies will promise training - IP delivered. There are a lot of good people to work with as well, I have had no major issues with management and even the 'high level' mangers are approachable, for the most part. From my experience, upper management is as in touch with their employees as they can be in an organization of this size. Outside of entire facility closure, I haven't seen any layoffs and even in those cases, the chances of being able to relocate (if willing) and maintain a position with IP have been good to excellent. In most areas there is little outsourcing and much of that is 'temp to hire' - and they actually do hire in many of those cases, if you do a good job. Additionally; while there is some debate overall on the subject, for the most part - hard work is rewarded. Very good life/work balance - when I needed time off the most, it wasn't even questioned - a manager 3 levels above me told me to take the time I need for my family.
","Large environment creates many 'work silos' - keeping you in a narrow scope of responsibilities, that can be a 'con' to a degree since you do not get much experience outside of your 'specialty'. It is also easy to get 'lost in the crowd' if you aren't a very assertive personality. Change is slow in coming and there can often be a 'hurry up and wait' dynamic on projects. Promotions can be limited, depending on the facility you are located at. the overly ambitious may not find it the best environment for quick advancement.
Advice to Management
Keep doing what you are - keep your focus on customers and employees. Thanks for the considerations on work-life balance and thanks for keeping most position in-house.

In an ideal world, the pay has great upside potential. 

The company, as a whole, is well positioned to continue to be a leader in the global paper products industry.
","Politics and management style impact your career, income, and job satisfaction. Two employees with nearly identical skill sets, working for two different managers in two different geographies will have two completely different opportunities. In one region, management promotes, recognizes, and rewards good performance. In the second region, the management makes decisions which limit the employees success, but blames the employee for poor performance. The management in region two is less likely to recognize good performance. 

Having a manager that is willing to share the credit for good performance and recognizes good performance to mid-level and top level managers, is the difference between an employee that will be promoted, and an employee that will become stagnant and unproductive.
Advice to Management
Recognize that performance reviews are extremely subjective; even with quantifiable objectives. Management will make decisions that impact the performance of an employee, but will blame the results of these decisions on the employee in his / her review. Understand that the current climate discourages circumventing the chain of command.

Sun Mar 17 2013, Maintenance Mechanic,"Wheat Ridge, CO",Current Employee ,Job openings are not real,0,"$20-$30 per hour plus benefits even after a pay freeze for ~4 years. Even entry level receive about $20/hour with barely a high school education.
","Always 6 days a week, sometimes 7 days.

Very, Very Physical, heavy labor and a lot of walking.

Personnel, Maintenance and Production openly criticize and ridicule each other. Management regularly mentions that production people are “stupid” and some use profanity often toward people. Almost all of Production and Maintenance Personnel are computer illiterate. High School and below is the education level plant wide.

Maintenance Department has 6-7 people. All with at least 20 years tenure. They constantly criticize each other in private and provoke new maintenance people with rude comments, not answering questions and giving them the worse jobs. Consequently new maintenance people don’t last more than about 6 months. Everyday your threatened with termination and have to put up with constant bullying, innuendos. Plant management has told the maintenance department to get more people, but the maintenance department doesn't want anymore. There really are no openings in maintenance, six have been forced to leave in ~two years. They will not tell you about the people who left during the interview process. The process is disingenuous. 

Management regularly turns his back on people and walks away mad when people ask questions. Looks at floor, not at your face when he does talk to people. Weird, strange irrational assignment of projects with no detail initially on how it is to be done or parts to do it, yet when the project is completed, or almost complete told to do it over, this time with detail on how he wants it. Wastes a lot of money, throwing parts at a problem via next day air. Management can barely speak and write English and consequently hard to understand.

Looking at the equipment on the floor you would think it is well maintained and in good working condition. That is not true. It is barely running and we constantly are being called to fix things, often just patched together so it will run a little longer, then break again on another shift. Your not going to sit down hardly at all, getting a break or lunch is not always the case, because of constant breakdowns. There are no parts. The parts room is more bins turned upside down, than parts. Mechanics buy extras and stash, hide them around the shop.

Management pretends to be very knowledgeable on electrical, mechanical, equipment, but is not. Theatrical shows are put on, with a messy desk, papers, manuals everywhere along with nonsensical dissertations on maintenance topics. Most of the people, and the most knowledgeable are on day shift with management . Mechanics are usually alone on night shift. 

No backups programs for Programmable Logic Controllers or Variable Frequency Drives. Collection, mess of cables, interfaces in drawers for a 10 year old laptop that locks up constantly and is covered with dirt, grease. Will not instruct, show or answer questions about PLC controlled equipment. Will get mad if you ask, turn back on you and walk away.

Usually covered with grease everyday. Unlikely, you will get a uniform even if you ask. It is unlikely that you will get a uniform even if you ask. The shop is a mess. Junk, old parts cover all the benches month after month along with a heavy coat of grease. To work on something, you have to shove junk off onto the floor. The next day, the same bench is covered again with junk, grease.

Thu Apr 21 2011,N/A,"Memphis, TN"," in Memphis, TN",large multinational with steady work and good leaders,2,"Through the recent recession, employees were still given raises and cost of living wage increases. The company has recently refocused attention on core highly profitable long term businesses - making boxes for example and has become a world leader in this market and others. 
The company has been around for a long time (over 100 years) and is likely to be around for a lot longer. If you are interested in a large multinational with slow and steady growth, this is it. 

Mr. Faraci is in touch with his Memphis employees and is leading the company in the right direction. He took a very bold step in raising cash and taking on substantial debt to purchase a division from Weyerhaeuser but I believe that it was the right decision for the company.
","This is low profit margin manufacturing large multinational company. 
Therefore there are many layers of management, too many useless and duplicate reports to do and other seemingless foolish administrative tasks that are not apparently useful to those working in the trenches. 
For similar reasons the company wants to justify every project and watches it's money very closely. 
Changes have to regarded 
Mid level managers may be under utilized and therefore have time to micromanage. Some employees, due to the size of the company, and a somewhat lax management attitude in some areas, feel that they can get away with not working. They may in the short term but International Paper will terminate them eventually (may take years) . 
Corporate at time's seems to kowtow to businesses units and manufacturing facilities, taking the attitude that if they say they have to have then they must be .
Too many ""diverse"" employee's in positions that they are unqualified and unsuited for. 
In some areas I have witness'ed a cliques led by managers lead to incometence being ignored.
Many employees know ""the system "" is broken and dont try to attempt to fix it any more and instead just allow it continue by lying about others performance or by finding another way to accomplish a task.
Thus failures are glossed over and allowed to continue. 

The company continues to pay lip service to environmental causes and in some cases is hypocritical.
For example the company will say one thing, and do another : it has an impressive media campaign that printing on paper is better than emailing yet internally has diverted all paper notices to email versions. 
Large office buildings within Memphis, could and should have been made green decades ago (solar panels) , an investment that would have paid for itself already. 
Company does not internally recycle cans, glass or plastic . Nor does it lead such recycling programs within the community. 
The company has reduced it's north american land holdings, avoiding the responsibility of land stewardship while at the same time promoting such stewardship.

The company continues to off shore as much work as possible. The US staff continue to drive the work but understand less and less as they have a hands off attitude and become more and more project managers. This results in systems which no one understands 2 years after building, and which often do not work. 

Corporate divisions such as Human Resources and IT are understaffed and have insufficient resources, leading to long lag times or no response.
Advice to Management
Eliminate the global employee survey. My team will spend hours attempting to fix a problem that we cant fix due to a poor management decision made 10 years ago. problem that we are unable other managers have ignored for years.My team is seriously considering lying on the next survey in the hope that they dont have to perform any more useless remedial actions that wont change the result of the poor management decision made 10 years ago. For this survey International Paper paid millions of dollars in the time from employees. 

A real incentive to employee productivity improvements would be a share of the savings in cash. 

Remove bonus' for managers. Too often we see useless objective completed merely to make managers look good for their end of year reports so that they can make their bonus'. These false objectives gloss over or ignore real work that should be accomplished that could save the company substantial sums.
