Good work-life balance
Good initial salary for new hires
The job is very complicated in a rewarding way
There is flexibility to move between programs if you are not critical to the program (try not work on a program for an extended period of time if you don't like it or accept responsibilities that will make you hard to replace, so be vocal and helpful to other programs)
Lots of oppurtunies to grow if you feel comfortable learning on the job
","Pay raises are not competitive but are guaranteed yearly
Actual training for the job is next to non-existent so it is a lot of trial by fire if you don't have a good mentor (great way to learn but you need to accept you will fail a lot initially and it is expected that you will fail but that is not properly communicated to most people so it can really wear you down when it feels like you are doing little correctly. Just remember, if they cared they would train you properly and since they didn't you just need to try to do your best and not get emotionally tied to the results of your work. I feel this is how everyone starts out in safety. This is a career that you can spend 5 years in and still only know 70% of what is going on.)
Great place to get your foot in the door but to receive significant raises you will likely need to company hop around (probably true for all defense contractors)
Advice to Management
They know what is up. There is just no will to support new hire training or push for methodology standardization (I am not pushing to modernize legacy program methodologies but to show how it should be done if funding allowed us to do it properly to the most current Military Standards). If training cannot be provided we can atleast provide gold plated examples for people to reference.

Tue Jan 19 2021, Systems Engineer,"Tucson, AZ",Current Employee ,Overall a good place to work at the moment,0,"- Competitive salary for someone with under 5 years experience.
- The company overall respects work-life balance.
- Most peers and managers are competent and have the overall aptitude to have their current position.
- Management seems to care somewhat about their employees in terms of their health and job security.
- They have been adding to their already strong culture of continuing education and personal development.
","- Promotions are steadily getting harder to come by and competition is increasing between employees. There is also a significant difference between the incomes of people who gained employment at a given level and those who naturally tried to rank up. I have heard from many employees the process almost seems entirely random. 

- One can see the company slowly starting to trim spending on employees where they can. For instance, cutting back on the terms of their retirement and pension plans for senior employees without warning. So much for it pays to be loyal. Its just an observation and does not effect me - I am a millennial with less than 5 years of experience.

- From my experience, there is a strong stigma against relatively early career employees handling any kind of increasing responsibility. Nearly all of management I have met expect one to work for several decades before you can even start talking about taking on additional responsibility.

","Way more cons than pros, hence the 1 star.

Lets start with the management. It sucks and can make your life miserable. I had several managers over my years there, and you cannot hold them accountable for anything. You have a work from home arrangement with your prior manager? Well this one doesn't allow that. You work from 7am-3pm? Well this one requires 9am-5pm. Nothing is consistent and no prior arrangements are honored, usually. I had one manager honor all my past arrangements and he lasted all of 5 months.

Next we can do the company culture. Never before have I seen such emphasis on inclusion and diversity to see the culture be the complete opposite. Many groups are established for black, Hispanic, disabled, LGBT, you name it. Then, you find out management is mostly a good ol' boys club with some pretty racist and sexist overtones. You can bring it up to HR, but they won't do anything unless you have some real damning evidence. If you lack that evidence, you'll also paint a target on your back. Basically the hypocrisy in middle management about implementing policies in made by upper management is laughable. 

Next is HR & Ethics. These groups mainly exist to protect the company and they don't care about you at all. If you are doing something, no matter how small and easily fixable it is, that could threaten the company, consider yourself on the way out. It is not unheard of for people to make anonymous claims to HR/ethics to get people fired. I've seen some older employees targeted because of small stuff, but they'll use whatever they can to terminate them.

Lastly is the career opportunities and pay. The pay is par, at best, for your location. Most other DoD contractors in the area pay more, but most aren't willing to get you a clearance like Raytheon is. It is entirely common for people to get their clearances and start looking for another job, because you can get a 20% increase by moving across the street. For your own job advancement, it is less about how well you perform and more about how long you have been there. When I was up for promotion, the first questions were ""You're over 30, right?"" and ""You have a masters, right?"". It was less about my actual evaluation and more about my time in the company. So if you're a high performer and expect to be promoted accordingly, look elsewhere.

At the end of the day, this company exists for people who like a lot of structure, red tape, and overwhelming bureaucracy. If you became an engineer to be creative and have some freedom in your product, this isn't for you. If you're looking to coast to retirement, this company is absolutely for you. Bare minimum and becoming a number are the way to do things around here for many.

Fri Nov 13 2020, Engineer,"Andover, MA",Former Employee ,Terrible culture,3,"-It's a great place to do engineering work; the challenges of defense contracting are extremely interesting. 

-Good opportunities to build skills and grow your career if you are willing to network.

-It's an extremely stable industry.

-As an entry level/early career employee, you work 40 hours per week; no more, no less. This can be a pro or a con depending on where you're coming from; the one caveat being that hours are fairly inflexible. If you need to do overtime it is paid.
","-If you're not a white man, it's pretty inhospitable out there. The casual sexism and racism by fellow employees is off the charts. Upper management is pushing D&I initiatives, which are great, but it really doesn't translate into a lower level cultural change. You can succeed professionally, but day-to-day interactions with coworkers will be exhausting to navigate.

-You can negotiate market rate pay coming in, but you won't see much salary growth which is a huge issue if you're early career. (Perhaps not so much if you're coasting to retirement as many are.)

-Benefits are mediocre; would expect better from a company whose main benefit is stability and work/life balance. Decent 401k match, high deductible health plan, small bonuses, no stock.

Tue Nov 03 2020, Systems Engineer I,"El Segundo, CA",Current Employee ,Knowledgeable engineers but slow pace,0,"Steady workflow. Things get really busy as important milestones approach (Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review) but ramp down in between. Usually, your functional manager finds work for you, so there is (almost) always work to be done. There are many expert engineers and Engineering Fellows to learn from, and there are seasonal company-facilitated courses that you can take for free to broaden your knowledge. Benefits are pretty good and the Paid Time-Off program is nice, although since this is my first job out of college, I don't have anything to compare them to. Most of the people I've met so far are really nice too.
","Work can be slow and there isn't much supervision on less-experienced workers. I joined RTN 1 month after I graduated college and it was rough the first few months. Everyone seemed too busy to mentor me or train me. The company consists of a lot of experts and senior-level engineers, and they rarely hire new graduates unless they went through their internship program. I think since most of the employees are older and experienced, they forget how to treat or train new team members since usually everyone already knows what they're doing. It's difficult to learn things on your own since you'll be working with classified information. There may be documents or data that you can't access. There is a lack of mentorship, which can be discouraging, and an imbalanced workload on employees. In my department, there are some employees that have easy tasks while others have to come on weekends. Not sure if that's the nature of the job but it's something I've observed.

-Pay is ok.
-Work life balance is meager. They encourage you to work long hours and on weekends and they do give mod time and sometimes overtime.
-Adjustable desks.
-People joke about incompetence of upper management.
-Information is in a wiki everywhere as well as presentations are everywhere.
-Good referral bonus if you refer senior engineers
-$10,000 a year for graduate courses.
","-Promotions are political: I was passed over for a promotion even though I was the main person working on my Six Sigma project. A teammate who did almost nothing on Six Sigma and who started later than me got promoted over me.
-Overtime and time charging is nickled and dimed to the n'th degree. They constantly remind you that lunch does not count as work and want you to charge tot he nearest 6 minutes (never really enforced though, just threatened)
-People are jerks. They yell at you for not knowing things despite the fact that the knowledge transfer is lacking. Even thought there is a wealth of information no one knows where it is. Oh, and if you happen to ask the wrong person a question you will get reamed out in a group email.
-They put people where they need them, not based on the person's wants or interests. This severely stymied my career growth.
-Their COVID response was and still is lacking. There was no effort made to get the people working in closed areas working remote. And they used thermometers comparable to meat thermometers to test if you had a fever.
-Lower ranked people aren't listed too and publicly ridiculed if they make mistakes.
-They could not have picked a worse time to merge with United Technologies: they merged during March of 2020 when COVID was at it's worse. Needless to say, I am not surprised at the numerous layoffs on the aerospace side of the business.
-They censor out survey responses they don't like. This happened to my wife.

- Solid pay-scales and pay-raise opportunities.

- Great vacation and sick leave.
","As the company grows, it becomes more and more bureaucratic and over the 10 years I've worked for Raytheon, I've watched communication go down the drain entirely, even in the smallest of groups within a program.

- Overly complex management structure. Program managers, operations managers, supply chain managers, district managers, project managers, site managers, shipping managers. Literally everyone is a ""manager"" in Raytheon! It's insane. In our program of roughly 25 employees, more than 15 of them are ""managers."" 

- Not keeping up with trends in organizational structure that other companies are adopting to stay competitive. I.e. Raytheon is still HIGHLY hierarchical and I believe this comes from the high amount of retired veterans and constant work with the government. They cannot let go of the military world and they bring it into the corporate environment. Not to mention, they all hire one another into their ""Good-Ole-Boy Club"", even though they have ZERO experience in the field (We literally have a former high school teacher and genetics engineer as the head of our quality department in a maintenance program). 

In a world where decisions must be made quickly and competition is fierce with technology, Raytheon is lacking massively. A perfect example of this is it took 8 months for me to get a new laptop, even though mine was running on Windows 7 and being repeatedly locked out of Raytheon's own system due to being a security risk. EIGHT MONTHS. Emails went all the way up to our program manager, operations manager, IT department - no responses ever. No action. At least not until my computer was completely locked out of the system and I demanded IT to get me a new laptop.

- Benefits are lacking for such a large and diverse corporation. Health insurance is the worst I've ever seen in the industry. Nothing but a health savings plan (HSP)? Really Raytheon? One single medical event and years' worth of savings are drained.

- I've experienced more broken promises from management than kept promises. I've witnessed management tell an employee their job is safe and 6 months later call them up to tell them their position is being terminated. Not even a face-to-face meeting. HR emails them their severance paperwork, sign it, and done. Out the door they go after years of working for the company.

- HUGELY understaffed projects across the entire enterprise. In a world of contracts, the bottom bid gets the win. So what does that mean when you can't cut costs in overhead? You cut from staff. We pile on many positions' worth of duties onto single individuals, and this creates more and more mistakes, burnout, and eventually loss in morale. People within my program who've worked for the company for decades have told me they've never seen Raytheon so low before. All we ever talk about is money - never the people, never the quality.

- Meetings to have meetings to have meetings. My god we never stop having meetings. Doing our jobs with Bluetooth in our ears on mute, quite literally, all day long. Then after a meeting is over, individuals from the meeting call each other to complain about other people in the meeting and what a waste of time it was to have one another in the meeting. It's completely counterproductive and a total joke. Take some lessons from Elon Musk and cut the meetings. Meetings were created in a time when emails, texts, and instant communication didn't exist (you know, the 1950s). We don't need it anymore - period. I know managers that are literally paid to sit and have teleconference meetings - $100k/year salaried individuals to sit and have meetings. Talk about waste!

- Massive lack of use of technology in my particular program. We are still doing bookkeeping with physical paper and typing in data that could be easily scanned with barcodes. Yet to ""justify our jobs"" we keep doing things like we did in the 1990's. Myself and other employees have researched and presented ideas for a more productive use of technology, only to be given excuse after excuse by upper management why we can't implement these tools. Our program won't even buy iPads to do inspections of equipment with because ""security is a nightmare."" 

- Red tape. As mentioned above, bureaucracy. We have to get approval just to order office supplies - pens, paper, ink. I watched a former manager get written up because he purchased too much Windex at one time (making it a HAZMAT purchase - for a 5 gallon jug) and this was ""against company policy."" What a joke. Are you serious Raytheon?

- Lack of trust of employees. Management does not trust employees. Period. Hence the constant ""training"" and red tape that covers management's butts rather than investing in the employees.

- Lack of trust of management. Employees don't trust managers. Managers don't reply to emails or phone calls inquiring about important business opportunities and needs. But god forbid you forget to fill out your time card - management will call you at 3:30am (because they're in another time zone) to make you fill it out.
Advice to Management
You need to COMPLETELY redesign the company management structure and culture from the ground up. Raytheon continues to grow (especially after the recent merger) and we just get worse and worse. Communication falls apart, morale is down the drain, and to be honest, I hate going to work. It is nothing but a complaint and moan fest from all employees and that's because we do nothing but spend our days fixing problems that never used to exist because we are overworking our staff and more worried about pinching pennies than investing in the greatest asset of any company - the people. 

In short, get your stuff together, management. Most of you are living on double-retirements and STILL pulling salaries from Raytheon, so the drive and ingenuity to keep Raytheon competitive just isn't there. I've heard many managers say they'll be fine if the program tanks. While those of us with young kids and families are struggling to make a solid living and future for ourselves.

This company is not a family or people-oriented business. All you care about is satisfying the government instead of standing up for what is right. 

And this comes from a guy who was offered a $15,000/year pay CUT when offered a promotion after completing his Bachelor's Degree. I was told, ""You have to think of compensation in terms of opportunity sometimes. We are offering you less pay, but greater opportunity.""

Tell that to my family who you wanted to take more than $1,000/month away from.

I had to fight for 3 months to get the promotion with the same pay I was already getting.

And have yet to get a pay-raise 2 years later, although I've been given many additional duties and responsibilities.

First chance I get to be free from this company, I'm taking it.

And there isn't much you can do to keep me, since the culture is downright horrendous at this company. It's completely unenjoyable to work at the company.

I write this review in hopes of not only stirring up management to wake up and make some changes, but to steer good people away until this company gets it crap together.
Helpful (1","You need to COMPLETELY redesign the company management structure and culture from the ground up. Raytheon continues to grow (especially after the recent merger) and we just get worse and worse. Communication falls apart, morale is down the drain, and to be honest, I hate going to work. It is nothing but a complaint and moan fest from all employees and that's because we do nothing but spend our days fixing problems that never used to exist because we are overworking our staff and more worried about pinching pennies than investing in the greatest asset of any company - the people. 

In short, get your stuff together, management. Most of you are living on double-retirements and STILL pulling salaries from Raytheon, so the drive and ingenuity to keep Raytheon competitive just isn't there. I've heard many managers say they'll be fine if the program tanks. While those of us with young kids and families are struggling to make a solid living and future for ourselves.

This company is not a family or people-oriented business. All you care about is satisfying the government instead of standing up for what is right. 

And this comes from a guy who was offered a $15,000/year pay CUT when offered a promotion after completing his Bachelor's Degree. I was told, ""You have to think of compensation in terms of opportunity sometimes. We are offering you less pay, but greater opportunity.""

Tell that to my family who you wanted to take more than $1,000/month away from.

I had to fight for 3 months to get the promotion with the same pay I was already getting.

And have yet to get a pay-raise 2 years later, although I've been given many additional duties and responsibilities.

First chance I get to be free from this company, I'm taking it.

And there isn't much you can do to keep me, since the culture is downright horrendous at this company. It's completely unenjoyable to work at the company.

I write this review in hopes of not only stirring up management to wake up and make some changes, but to steer good people away until this company gets it crap together.

","The HR department needs to be completely overhauled, they have an inability to do basic tasks and have created a toxic environment where asking for HR assistance becomes detrimental to your career. Middle management is given too much power because HR does not look at complaints objectively. HR should be the middle ground, not taking sides on HR issues. It is clear that they pick and choose which issues they want to get involved with based on severe favoritism.

Several middle managers are promoted from a technical role, which is a bad idea. Just because the person is great engineering does not mean they will make a great manager. Not to mention these middle managers try to put people in corners, whether they agree with the career direction or not. This is a sad and unfortunate way to manage employees.
Advice to Management
Create an environment that does not tolerate favoritism. Ensure that middle management is not misusing the internal disciplinary or ombudsmen process to their advantage, train HR to be objective. Reevaluate middle managers and determine which should be in a non-manager technical role and which should not be managers at all. Make this change quickly so that it sends a message through the organization that it is important. 

Take diversity seriously, it takes action not just some colorful internal emails. Diverse potential candidates or internal employees must see people like them in middle management or above to see that what you are saying is important.

Wed Aug 26 2020, Senior Systems Engineer,"Waltham, MA",Current Employee ,10 years and have never seen anything like this,2,"Former Raytheon employees have heart. They truly care about what they do and the Customer (war fighter/peace keeper - pick your position). You will learn a lot here about yourself, and how to work in teams (whether good or bad). Former UTC employees are consultants and used to working a contractor mindset (this is not a pro).
","Since the merger with UTC, I have not heard one good, positive, enthusiastic comment from anyone; be it from the now consolidated 2 businesses (had 4 last year and 6 in 2012) or the corporate entities. The merger is a takeover. The skills, innovation, thought and insight of the former Raytheon employees has been brushed aside to be led by multiple consulting firms. Book expertise is what's changing this company. Real world application is now a thing of the past. Pooling resources instead of building skills. Disconnect and inconsistent messaging and communications to employees. 10% pay reduction for parts of the company and mass layoffs elsewhere, including Pratt and Rockwell. Change is good, yes, but this feels like the real life version of the movie Annihilation. Forecast for career advancement and truly building a skillset are slim. Compensation is taking a hit from ""Covid"". Work/Life balance is decent but only if you have a manager who believes in it (policy is one thing, but everything is manager discretion). Senior mgmt is self-absorbed and is well versed at lip service. There is a clear disconnect between what sr mgmt says and what we all experience day-to-day. Culture and values are changing and not necessarily for the better.

Advice to Management
Stop promoting incompetent employees who are you buddies, family or fellow friends. I have worked at Raytheon for 10+ years. The culture at Raytheon is mostly a toxic work environment. Management favors certain class of employees over others. This enables favorable employees to make accusations against other coworkers for punishment. Management also encourages unethical and questionable behavior towards their unfavorable employees to justify their termination or self separation of the company. I have heard multiple complaints about management unethical behavior from coworkers without resolution from ethics or upper management. Raytheon does have a high attrition rate. The average new employee last about 2-3 years before they leave the company. Raytheon knows they can hire and fire base on their preferred class of employees. New employees will enjoy their time there early on but later notice a change when conflicts keeps arising every time and everywhere you go of no fault of your own. If you are a favorable class you won't notice this at all. However, the unfavorable employee will become disgruntled and be ignored by management and by coworkers. I know many companies practice this behavior but it is very rampant at Raytheon.

Outdated tools (IDEs, source control, compilers, issue/story tracking, etc.)

Outdated mindset on how software is built. There is widespread use of agile in the form of scrum, but a lot of apathy or disdain for it, especially by those who have been around a long time. So ymmv on how well it is practiced. The development style of the code is very 80s and 90s.

It reflects the change in values of the organization. Many of the managers I experienced were technically incapable and failing in leadership. The place is heavy with politics and backstabbing.

Sat May 30 2020, Software Engineer,"Portsmouth, RI",Former Employee ,"It depends... Probably not the best for Software, good in other areas.",2,"Depending on what you want to do with your career, Raytheon can be a good place to start or stay. Bear in mind everything I'm saying is for the office in Portsmouth, RI, and for the biggest program over there, which is in a ""maintenance stage"", your experience might be very different in other programs/location. 
For a Software Engineer, unless you're planning to move to management or leadership and you REALLY like this industry (the military, defense, politics) I do not recommend you stay here too long as your skills as a ""Software Developer"" are going to quickly deteriorate and come to a halt, it might become really hard to get a job in Software/Technology companies after getting used to how things are done here. Salaries are comparable to other defense companies, but really below to what the market offers in commercial companies (When I switched to my current employee my salary literally doubled), Health Insurance is just bad, very expensive high deductive plans . Needless to say, there are a lot of great people here and I feel grateful for how well they treated me and all the opportunity I was given. 
 Some of the highlights for the Pros: 
- There are some really nice and smart people that work here, people are willing to help you and guide you through on baby steps. 
- 9/80 schedule, you get every other Friday off (standard in Defense Contractors) 
- Modtime: you can adjust your schedule within reason to complete your hours for the week (this is double edge sword, as you are expected to record your time by the minute, more on this on the cons) 
- 10k Education Reimbursement (at least at the time I was there).
- Overall a very relaxed environment (although this depends on the project/location), but in general you just worry about putting in your hours for the week and you're done.
- 2 Weeks off in December because of the Holidays.
","Oh boy... where do I start? There's a lot of things I didn't like about this place, and a lot of it is baked in the culture already, either because people here have only worked here and they don't know any better, or ""that's just how things are"" in the defense industry.
There is a lot ""Factory Worker"" mentality here (at least with Software Engineers), you're expected to record your hours by the minute, and by that, I mean that different task/projects get different ""charge codes"" allocated to them and you're supposed to record and ""charge"" to those ""codes"" for every task you do. That leads to some really awkward moments, like meetings that you have to ""make up"" the time for because there is no charge code associated with them. A lot of people avoid company events because that would mean that you would have to end up making up the time for it (All-hands meetings, different organizations activities, etc). A lot of the mandatory training you'll have to make up in you're own time (although leadership was trying to change this by the time left). Yup, you read that right ""MANDATORY TRAINING"" on ""YOUR OWN TIME"", and we're not talking about training that is going to be useful to you in your career as an Engineer, I mean ""Ethics"" module and what not... 
This factory mentality leads to other things like holidays only providing you 8 hours to charge on 9 hour days and you having to make up 1 hour for every holiday. 
Work from home, allowed in certain programs, but very discouraged, you'll have to write a direct letter to your supervisor and manager explaining where you're going to ""spend those hours"". Snowday? Forget it, you can just do mod time or PTO. I even heard they were trying to make people use PTO or make mod time during the COVID-19 crisis. These are things that would be unacceptable in any other company, but here everybody is used to it so everybody dismisses it as ""is just the way it is"". 
My last point, probably the most important one and the reason I left, is that you won't be doing a lot of ""Engineering"" here. The biggest program here is the ""maintenance"" stage. Meaning that you'll be going through a big pile of technical debt trying to fix bugs and implement minor functionality. All of these with technology decades old, no tools and vision to fix the root of the problems(IDE? nah we use vim, Version Control? You'll be stuck with Clearcase, etc...). Don't expect to be attending seminars about the latest industry trends and/or best practices, don't even think about doing training outside the corporate modules about the technologies you're currently working with (which again, are at least 15 old). 
At the end of the day, if for some reason the program you're working loses funding (common in defense), you'll have a very weak foundation to continue your career in Software, at least outside defense.
Advice to Management
Invest more in your employees and their growth, give them a reason to stay. The Software Industry is very different in 2020 than what it was in the 90's . Millennials are going to keep moving on if you stick to you ""Factory Worker"" mentality, there are so many great opportunities out there and we're so connected nowadays.
