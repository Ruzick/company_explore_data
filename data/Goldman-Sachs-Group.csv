","As a pinnacle of capitalism, profits do come first. As with any company in the financial services industry, remember that bonuses (typically a large part of total comp) are discretionary and are based on company profits, which in turn depend on conditions in the financial markets. Thus, total compensation can vary from year to year (but all investment banks are the same in that regard).

Sat Jan 30 2021, Vice President,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Ok place to start your career. Underwhelming compensation.,2,"The teams I have worked for have had a great culture. Very little in the way of politics. There are tons of teams and I've heard the flip side, but generally engineering teams are pleasant to work in. I've also been fortunate to work with very clever people and have learnt a lot.

The firm is doing very well, so job security is good.

It's a good place to start your career as the Goldman Sachs name is good on the resume.

A few decent benefits. Good gym.
","Compensation is not correlated to firm performance, and is loosely based on individual performance for engineering staff. In a bad year, they will use poor firm results as an excuse not to pay you. In a good year, they will find some other excuse (eg. this year it was IMDB). They will also throw false promises of increasing your compensation in the future. For example, they might say ""This is not where you should be at, but this is the most I can give you, we will correct you and bring you where you should be in next years"". I have probably heard a spin of this 4 years in a row - have always had top performance reviews.

Additionally, getting a promotion to associate or vice-president does not increase your pay. Somehow just *getting* the promotion is considered a raise. Unfortunately for you it just means extra responsibility for not more pay.

There is a huge disparity in pay for people in the same position. You could be at the same level, doing the same work as someone sitting next to you, but they will be earning 50%+ more.

Unfortunately no matter what the firm advertises, they will continue to treat engineering talent as secondary class citizens - it's a bank.
Advice to Management
The firm is doing well. Stockholders are happy. I don't know how long you can keep that up if you prove that you don't reward good performance.

Wed Jan 20 2021, Research Analyst,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,"Mediocre at best, bad leadership",0,,"dering the cache that comes with the GS brand and the broad and deep access it can get, the quality of the equity research department is almost embarrassing compared to what it could be, and it has deteriorated meaningful under current leadership. Analysts are prevented from expressing any view that can be seen as controversial or in contrast with Investment Banking Agenda...there is no vision, no cohesive strategy on the product and career paths are driven by favoritism and extreme office politics.
Cons
While the quality of the economics research is high, on the equity side the issue lays with the leadership and should be addressed before the job is made entirely useless. With so much focus and demand for content, it is exceptionally bad that GS Research leadership appears to strive to make the analysts and their product as dull as possible as the business model.

Advice to Management
The culture at Goldman Sachs is deep-seeded, my advice would be to lower expected work hours to 40 hours a week for everyone (when possible), hire enough to get the workload done, and don't abuse the willingness of your employees to do whatever it takes to progress in the company. I don't care if I make 600,000+ a year, I want to enjoy life and I want a family and those things come 2nd when you work there.

","Depending on who you are and team you're in, sometimes it might feel like there is too much autonomy and not enough guidance.

Mon Oct 12 2020, Analyst,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Make sure you use GS like they use you,4,"-Brand Name - Cannot get any better
-Offers many training resources
-Some colleagues are highly skilled/even brilliant at their roles
-Exposure to C-level executives and some ""legends of finance"" in certain roles
-Opens doors if you are in the right role, specifically on a revenue generating desk or within a role that involves some sort of technical skills.
- If you are starting with the firm as an analyst or associate, the firm will ensure that you are well trained and treated somewhat decently. There has been too much bad PR surrounding the abuse of analysts recently for HCM to allow anything otherwise. This is especially true if you are female. 
-Talks at GS: you get to attend lectures from some very impressive politicians, celebrities, sports stars, business leaders, authors etc.
","-It's all about the name. You will be paid less as an analyst, associate or VP for the privilege of working at GS. The discount is real!
-The collegiate nature which the firm was once known for no longer exists. Its every man for himself now.
-The best outcome for clients is often not the focus anymore. The focus is often now just how can GS convince clients to give it money.
-It's too ""top heavy"". There are multiple heads of every division, group and desk which puts a massive strain on pay and often makes it difficult to discern what direction management wants you to go in.
-The hours aren't really worth the pay anymore.
-The hours are long as advertised and the competition is fierce, making it next to impossible to stand out.
-Your commercial contributions don't matter at the end of the day, only your manager's opinion of you matters. If you are liked by your manager, you will see decent bonuses and salary increases. If your manager doesn't like you, you'll be fired when they cut 10% of people each year.
-Even if you are performing well, all management really cares about is the bottom line so they will happily outsource your role to India or replace you with an algorithm if possible.
-Political correctness run amok. The leadership clearly supports a certain political agenda, let's call it ""New York liberal elitism"" and if you disagree and share the beliefs of maybe a Bernie Sanders or Trump you will be an outcast.
- If the revenue your desk is generating is consistent shrinking, it will be an all out bloodbath. Partners will blame MD who will blame VPs who will blame associates and analysts. Pay will be cut at every level in order to ensure that the Partners and MDs maintain their level of pay.
-VPs are so busy that they do not have time to teach junior analysts or associates.
-Politics which would put Congress to shame. It's all about who you know. Many colleagues who are friendly to your face and may even give you a good 360 review will say unflattering things about you behind closed doors. The culture is very gossipy and can be backstabbing.
-The company has no strategic direction. It's simply a bunch of people running around trying to cater to every whim of their boss.
-COVID-19: Senior leadership is on the record in the press saying that they would not lay people off in 2020 but they went ahead and laid people off anyway. They lied!
- Positive reviews: most are from very junior people who worked for the firm for less than 2 or 3 years and got a great exit opportunity or have never worked for a normal company. They don't represent reality.
Advice to Management
Forget about buying a corporate jet for the first time in firm history and figure out what you can do to make the firm more profitable and sustainable over the long run. Figure out what you can do to improve the culture and business mix. Stop trying to cling to old businesses to generate future growth.

Fri Oct 02 2020, Finance Director,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,You are better off working at McDonalds,1,"The only actual pro of working here is that all ignorant people around you are impressed/think you are smart or have some sort of special skill to be working at this bank when the reality is the complete opposite. Another pro was before covid (now everyone works from home) is that we used to get free dinner if we worked past 8PM which was pretty much every single day, a very nice gesture from Goldman to let you know you're welcome to keep slaving for nothing while receiving some cheap $25 stipend for dinner.
","I do not even know where to begin. I actually never thought I will be spending my time writing this but I believe everybody has a right to know how overrated this business is and how abusive this place has become. To begin with, Goldman Sachs employees are probably the most overworked individuals possible. It is not uncommon to wake up and before you even go to the bathroom, start working immediately without having time to eat or do anything else. You are literally a slave to your work, including Saturdays and Sundays. Don't think there is such thing as a break here. There is absolutely no personal space, management is extremely micro in regards to people management, they lack diversity and decision making, specifically the CEO who is all about public image and making sure his Instagram shows the outside one thing when the inside is a Jail. In short, a bunch of white older people with no sense of compassion, people skills or regard for human life. Just about a week, two Vice Presidents who recently came back from their maternity and paternity leave were fired. Even though Goldman Stated there WOULD BE NOT layoffs for 2020. Bunch of lies, just like every manager here. 

Long story short, you may be better off working at McDonalds. They are paid hourly while we are salary, so taking an average of the hours you work at this bank and your salary, you will find out you will probably make more money at Mickey Ds while being treated the same or probably even better. Do yourself a favor and do not work in this landfill.
Advice to Management
Stop acting like you care about your employees and actually show it for once. Stop lying to yourselves and making public statements you cannot even accomplish. Take a good look at yourselves and ask if you would like to be treated the same way you treat those under you. Implement actual policies that are visible to employees that show your actual goals in the future, hold yourselves accountable for missing them. Treat People as humans and not as livestock.

","I came into the firm as an experienced hire through a diversity hiring program. Within my first month a VP on my team told me I was only hired so management could get a “tax break”. I should have walked away at that point but I was determined to stick it out. Of the 4 or 5 people who originally brought me in to the firm, all were either fired or left in outrage before I even started - this should have been another red flag (because the firm has a massive turnover problem).

I felt that management consistently lied to me about a variety of things mostly pertaining to advancement. They would also talk pretty openly about horrible things they had done to past employees and laugh about it. 

Maybe these things could have been more tolerable if they were the meritocracy that they tout but they weren’t in my opinion. That same VP’s job revolved around technology and he/she didn’t know what a server was (literally asked me in a conversation once “what’s a server”); the difference being he/she was part of the elitist yet incompetent culture that permeates the NYC office. They regularly hire the children of clients and as you can imagine they are usually the kind who NEED their daddy to get them a job because they are otherwise completely unremarkable.

I stayed two years until I had to train another VP how to do a new job he/she was assigned and he/she couldn’t competently use excel (same individual would regularly try to humiliate analysts/associates for lack of technical skills until he/she took it a step too far once and was almost fired). 

Seriously as far as diversity programs go, you can’t bring someone in under the guise of receiving training and then have them train your VPs.
