I have been working at Ford Motor Company full-time for more than a year
Pros
-Pay is good
-Work independently
-Schedule is flexible since your work is commission based not hourly
Cons
Inconsistency: you never know how much you're really going to make per month since the job is commission based only (no hourly/salary), you never know what to expect from management.

Dealer Surveys: Every customer who purchases a new car gets a survey sent to their email. If the customer isn't completely satisfied with a part of the sales process, Ford takes 10% of whatever you made for the month. This includes ANYTHING, even if it wasn't your fault. The surveys are rated on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best) and you need to have a score of 4.85 or above to not be deducted 10%. I once had a co-worker that got around $700 deducted simply because the customer wasn't given cold water and wrote that in their survey; singlehandedly dropping his average below 4.85.
Advice to Management
Ford needs to set realistic expectations for its surveys. Mangement needs to stop being so aloof and disconnected from their employees, most have very short tempers.

Advice to Management
Look at your workers as more than just numbers. Don’t enable lazy behavior and follow through on discipline, instead of giving a safety stand down, having workers sign a roster then not caring about safety violations five minutes later. Utilize line workers who have a college education in leadership roles, instead of allowing anyone with minimal education/ lack of on the job experience.

Thu Aug 27 2020, Assembly Line Operator,"Louisville, KY",Current Employee ,Not the Job for Everyone,0,"Good pay, good benefits, yearly raises, centrally located by airport. Great support programs and reps to get you in touch with community services you might need. Free (but very limited/discounted) legal services plan. They pay for your health, dental, and vision insurance. FORD employees are given priority for intake at The Brook Hospital. They pay for college tuition, I think it's $6k per year, possibly per semester. The union can fight for you to keep your job in most instances, along with getting your termination reversed in many cases as well, of course, depending on what rules you broke. There is air conditioning in break rooms, restrooms, offices; and working fans at most every work station. There's a medical dept in the plant with nurses and a doctor for work related injuries or illnesses that occur while on the job. They also have a physical therapy dept on site for those who are prescribed pt to try and help minimize damage from repetitive motion injuries. You go to medical/physical therapy during your shift (while still getting paid) as someone covers your job for you to do so. There's fun union activities at the union hall/out in the community for your family. Holiday parties, trunk-or-treat, employee appreciation picnics, etc. If you surround yourself with the right people, you can create a great support system/community/extended family for you and your family.
","Very strange factory ""culture"". Tons of negativity, gossip, drugs, harassment, favoritism, manipulation, and taking advantage of people. You're best to go to work, not socialize with most, and head home straight after. This isn't all there is of course, but it's overwhelmingly THE culture there. They've only been hiring temps the past few years, not hiring them full-time for years. You only know the max length of your shift, but time varies daily and you don't know what time your shift ends until after halfway through your shift each day. People take advantage (on a whole other level) of any and every loophole they can find, in every single policy resulting in VERY divided and bitter co-workers and regular policy change to try to combat these issues. You have to save your vacation time to use during shut down bc each year. The parking lots are huge and you must get to work very early in order to park, walk through the turnstiles, and inside the building to wherever your specific job may be. There are security guards in the lots but there's still quite a bit of vandalism, theft, and just plain ""working hazard"" damage done to vehicles by people dropping screws and other things in the parking lots. Lots of flat tires for sure. Open drug/alcohol abuse in parking lots on breaks and in between shifts, so it's a difficult place for many to remain sober (without a very good plan ahead of time.) I imagine most factories of this size all having similar issues, but this is the only one I've worked at so I've got nothing to compare it to other than what I've heard from others. There's no a/c, but there is heat for a couple months in mid winter. It's a very loud environment, and an extremely monotonous and boring job that begins breaking your body down fairly early on with all the repetition. The pay is so high because they understand what you're giving up when you work there. You're ultimately trading your quality of life for a higher paycheck and better benefits, but by the time you make it to retirement your body is going to be hurting so much you won't be able to enjoy things as you would've if you'd worked elsewhere. That being said, you'll have the money to do things you wouldn't have been able to if you'd worked elsewhere. Figure out your priority, health or money; it's definitely a trade-off there. I honestly don't believe there's a way to have both if you work there your entire career. Possibly switching jobs frequently to limit repetitive motion injuries, staying ahead of probable injuries and taking extremely good care of your body, and finding ways to take time off through the year to give your body a much needed break to recuperate are the only ideas I can come up with that might help reach that goal of trying to have both.

Sun Aug 23 2020, Design and Release Engineer,"Dearborn, MI",Former Employee ,Some Engineering with lots of paperwork,0,"Lots of resources. TDRM's are great places to learn. Lots of systems of lesson's learned and best practices, but they are not enough to get the whole picture and mistakes still happen.

There are lots of people that are very good at their jobs. There are wonderful people who will help you constantly at WERS, or PDLs, or whatever other archaic/unruly system Ford is currently using.

People are typically easy to talk to and will do their jobs. You can go around and stop by practically anyone's desk and discuss an issue, you will come to an agreement, and path forward. And know, that you'll only have to prod them 3 times to get what they promised you.
","This will completely depend on your group, but mainly your supervisor. 

Your group is your program, NOT your commodity. Ford is completely oriented towards making a vehicle fit together, NOT making each component work the best. This is supposed to cause the different commodities to come together but it rarely does. It also causes repeated mistakes to happen. So you'll see the same issues on multiple programs because the same commodity engineers don't talk with each other that often.

Also, products are moving so quickly, by the time an issue is detected, another program has it already in the pipeline. Issues are caused by lack of communication between the different engineers of the same commodity AND when specs change in one group that cause issues in another.

There are so many supervisors that seem like lost workers. They have no idea what they are doing or how they got into their position. Even though they have a dozen people reporting to them, they will also be releasing parts and are too busy to BE a boss, or especially, a leader. Because of that, you will be on your own. Fend for yourself, most people will not try to help you on your issues. Rarely, yes, someone will, a bit, but that's rare.

So many reporting systems!!! The same 5 pieces of information will need to be reported 90 times a month. Redundant work takes up 2/3 of your engineering time. Management implicitly favors this work rather than making sure everything else is complete.
Advice to Management
Train your supervisors and managers at BEING supervisors and managers. Being a good engineer is the worst qualification! Those people rarely have the people and organizational skills to be a good supervisor.

Force commodity: engineers/finance/buyers/etc to sit together! So many issues can be solved by doing this. If someone changes jobs, then they have to MOVE desks.

Advice to Management
Figure out what your employees are best at (at the supervisor level), instead of putting them in potions where they feel so unmotivated that they end up on a one-way track to failure. 

Most of us did not go through expensive education honing problem-solving skills to sit in a chair, pushing paper like a secretary. This is exactly why folks come and go so frequently. They can feel their brains going stale as time passes, doing nothing but [insert monotonous task here].

Please also figure out how to cut down on the bureaucracy. Often, it seems like all the various subsystem groups work against each other when really they are all part of the same ""One Ford"" team.

Also, do us a favor and cut more middle management... what do they even do anyway??? Just talk down on employees that are actually pulling all-nighters doing the heavy lifting?
The only reason there seems to be a decent work-life balance at this company is that there are a handful of individuals in each department losing hair, sleep, and time with friends/family.

Just stay in the office past 7 pm, and you'll see them around. The janitors know them on a first-name basis if you need help finding them.

Sat Feb 29 2020, Senior Software Engineer,"Dearborn, MI",Former Employee ,Good place to work if you want to coast and not accomplish anything.,5,"From an IT perspective:

Good place to work if you want to coast and not accomplish anything.
Good place to work if you are tied to Michigan and want a semi-reliable paycheck.
Can be a good place to work if you land in a one of the rare good spots with good leader. Once you land in a bad spot you are stuck.

The company supports community service
","Toxic work culture focused on hierarchy over knowledge.
Actual culture does not align with published “Ford Culture” and “Ford Values”.
Culture of fear as management protects the bad actors. As an example, my LL5 (manager) angrily told us she had better not learn of any of us reporting bad behaviors to HR. She told us this after three of her people were investigated by HR and dismissed for cause. She conducted a witch hunt to attempt to find out who made the reports to HR. Incidentally HR did the right thing and it should of been done many years ago.

IT management is riddled with good old boy placements who lack the skills and knowledge for their position. They obtained the position by paying homage to the club. It is a Ponzi scheme. The leaders recruit new people to help push them upwards and push others out, all without really accomplishing anything of value. The 2019 leadership purge oddly kept all the bad leaders and purged the good ones. The good ones in my eyes being those making a difference and having knowledge and skills. 

The highly skilled and knowable workers are held hostage by their supervisors and managers. They are not allowed to apply for other positions as they are often the only worker in the work group doing any real work. When the worker insists on being allowed to apply for other positions, the supervisor will then sabotage the workers future prospects. The worker then must leave Ford or continue to do the same job for 30 years or until the supervisor leaves.

Not a place to work if you wish to continual learn, grow and actually accomplish things. 

Large population of entitled workers who spend their time on non-productive activities, including blocking progress of those who are trying to get work done. The most popular game is to take credit for the work of the one or two people actually doing work.

Watching all the most talented and respected IT workers jump ship with regularity. 

Dated technology and processes.

Watching culture rapidly deteriorate as people adopt behaviors they believe will protect their job from the next hatchet.
Advice to Management
Papering the walls with Ford Culture posters accomplishes nothing. It only serves as notice to all of how toxic the culture is. The only leader who I observed actively changing the culture was Mulally.

Why would you think that the leaders who created and prop up the toxic culture would change it? They push out anyone who tries to change the culture. Purge the entire IT leadership tree CIO through LL6 and start over. Purge all the entitled retired on the job employees. 

Consider outsourcing the IT infrastructure teams. Their skills, technologies and processes are dated and full of red tape. They are a blocker of progress instead of enabling progress.

It also felt like all the jobs I was given were worthless projects and busywork, I never felt like I had the ability to make a contribution to the company.

Mon Sep 30 2019, Engineer,,Former Employee ,Be careful if you work here.,6,"There is interesting and challenging work here if you are fortunate to get into the right department. Company policy requires you to stay 18-24 months in a role even if it is not a good fit for you so take that into account. If you are young or a new grad, the company has some decent benefits for parental leave, new parents, etc.
","Main focus is on new graduates or those with 0-3 years experience. If you are older with an established career, you will get sidelined and ignored here. Very little actual career development opportunities, you will be told to go and watch videos at your desk. Never more than one week of training provided per year and the burden for approval is huge...forget meaningful conference and seminar opportunities. Compensation increases are very difficult and typically consist of 2-3% paid out to everyone once per year regardless of any other parameters. This is known as ""merit increase"" at Ford. Toxic, no trust environment. CYA at all times!! After hiring, the goal is on financial reporting to management, there is little or no engineering integrity. The company does not produce, it assembles. All vehicle components, hardware, software, etc are sourced out to suppliers based on requirements. Lowest bidder wins. Engineering at this company simply means writing requirements for supplier bids and verifying that the requirements have been met. Project managers and financial bean counters have veto power, not engineers. The company is also technologically backward...even critical operations and decisions are handled by emailing spreadsheets back and forth. No major corporate ERP system is in place and used throughout the company. Huge question marks around future tech such as autonomous as most of that (if not all) has been farmed out to other companies.

2) fairly relaxed atmosphere. flexible work hours.
3) re-designing the cafeterias, campuses
","1) Supervisors/Managers are absolutely incompetent. They will not rock the boat or make any decision that will impact their employment and thus their pension. They do not know how to manage employee conflicts, or request for work assistance. Their standard approach is: be quiet or it goes in your performance review.
2) Co-workers will openly insult you in meetings, call you stupid/idiot if you do not agree with their strategy or question their engineering approach.
3) Most of my co-workers are very bitter because they feel they haven't been given their due promotion or salary increase. So they will refuse to help any newer co-worker or put in any extra effort that involves work outside of their assigned project or causes them to put a few minutes outside of 8 hrs a day. Else they demand that their assigned project deadline be delayed or they get paid overtime, even if they are salaried. So they will basically ask you to re-invent the wheel unless they are compensated. 
4) Ford employees who have been around for a while are very good at making look like they do work, when in reality they are just good at coming up with a million obstacles about why something cant be done. The incompetent supervisor, since he/she doesnt know enough, will just go along and buy the excuse. Then employee will spend most of the time on the internet or talk about NFL.

","This company doesn’t pay you for the time that you work. There is no clock in system at Ford Chicago Assembly Plant. You have to sign your name on a piece of paper to get paid.

You won’t see the money until 3+ weeks later. The department I was in serval of my co-workers didn’t get paid for DAYS that they worked. Management doesnt’t follow safety regulations. The Union absolutely does not fight for you. The environment at the plant is very hostile and unfortunately ghetto.

Thu May 30 2019, Technology,,Current Employee ,Things have gone downhill,5,"Work/life balance is mostly good but varies by area.
","The culture has spiraled down into something toxic in the last few years. I've been there 5 years and the ""one Ford"" culture from Alan Mulally is all but gone. At all levels, fiefdoms have been created. The company's outward messaging is that they're a technology company. This is far from the truth. Upper management has promoted talking about great ideas and not implementing them. They have wasted countless millions/billions on worthless acquisitions only so they can say ""look how techy we are"", when in reality, we don't even know how to make money on cars anymore, much less high tech sectors like autonomous vehicles or mobility ventures. Pretty soon I expect the bubble to pop (it already has to some extent with the onset of layoffs). This company has lost its way. If you're looking for a ""tech"" job, look elsewhere, because you will only be disappointed. On top of that, comp and growth is poor. Employees with other job prospects are jumping ship at the first opportunity. Don't get suckered by the brand name, you'll only be disappointed.

","As an engineer, you want your challenges to be technology related. Trying to figure out the most efficient way to return data or the fastest way to do something. However, at Ford, you will not be doing this. Your challenges will be surrounded around getting around the bureaucracy that cripples this company from leading in automobile technology.

Additionally, architecture still works in their dinosaur ways, even though we're using new cloud technologies.

Mon Dec 17 2018,Anonymous,"Dearborn, MI",Former Employee ,Only take the job if you like to sit around do nothing and get paid well,13,"I was an Engineer (electric vehicles related)
Very competitive benefits (base salary, vacations) in auto-industry
Extremely relaxed work environment (with the exception of some teams, most people work a couple of hours a day and call it good)
Employee discounts on Ford vehicles
To most extent, very nice and easy-going colleagues
Jim Hackett and executive team realizes Ford's troubles ('clock' speed, efficiency) but have not done much to change things, especially at middle management level
","Join Ford if this is your only offer. If you are young and looking for a job to do your best work, grow skills, and build a career, then walk away. I chose Ford over multiple FANG offers and I wish I had a time-machine. You have been warned! 

If you stay too long your skills won’t be marketable. In my interviews, I was explicitly told that the pace of things at the new company would be very different (read fast) from Ford.

Performance reviews are a joke. You copy your generic goals from the start-of-year to the comments section. Supervisors do not even meet to discuss your career or to give any feedback on what you can do better.

Red tape. Every single technical decision goes to layers of supervisors and managers and it never goes to technical experts. I noticed that even the most hard working people spent most of their time getting approvals from managers instead of working with technical experts to make great products.

To make matters worse, middle management does not value people for their technical skills. you can come with a bachelors/masters/phd or spend 10 years working at Ford, there are very few managers who will appreciate you for your skills. Most employees (at GSR level) are considered soldiers in an army; the managers only care about the quantity of soldiers, not who they are or what they bring to the table. Makes it very easy to stay under-radar if you don't like to work. Becomes very hard to do any work if you want to progress in career.

I copied this from another review since it described supervisors very well. ""Since well over half the people do no work, supervisors keep adding staff saying they need more resources to get work done.""

Good luck using your personal business days. At least my supervisor made sure that he knows exactly what you are going to do and for how long so that you can come to work for the remaining hours. One of my colleagues used his vacation days to attend an event for professional training because that was the only way.
Advice to Management
Fix your middle management. Good employees who care about the company and want it to succeed are leaving. Figure out job responsibilities; what is the role of a supervisor and how can teams work with technical expert; right now it is a wild west. Jim Hackett keep sending the huddle messages every week and take action on what you preach.

Tue Dec 11 2018, Software Developer,"Dearborn, MI",Current Employee ,Fair to Midling. IT review,3,"Hackett.
It is a job with benefits.
It could be a great job. 
If you need to stay in Michigan it is one of the better places to work.
","Ford IT wants to believe it has transformed to a tech startup company. Delusional thinking. Red tape is everywhere. Innovation is more often penalized than rewarded.

Much of IT Leadership are too narrow minded to see innovation potential. 
Punitive leadership leads to fear based decision making.
IT teams hide information from each other and sabotage each other.
Management set in their draconian ways. Large contingent of IT managers should not be allowed to manage people. If these IT Managers treated dogs like they do their people they would constantly bitten. 

It is almost impossible to change jobs - internal posting are mostly just to check a box and say they advertised the opening - when they already have someone selected. Constant political battles between managers make it very difficult to change to a jobs.
Your manager will most likely have zero interest in your career. I have yet to have a manager who asked me what my career goals are.
Unfortunately, If you establish yourself as a dedicated, talented employee, you will be stuck doing repetitive work and soon hate your job. 
The more established you get, the more time you'll spend in endless meetings, which results in ever poorer work-life balance as you end up doing most of your real work after hours. Since most IT managers are technically incompetent you'll spend more time explaining and selling your work than doing it.
If you forget to pay homage to the old boys club, you will never get assigned interesting work or a promotion. 

The office space is horrible. FMCC is filthy, dark and moldy. The renovations to open offices are a waste of money. ITHQ BIC is awful - the new open office plan is atrocious. It is impossible to get work done, even with blinders and earplugs. 
The leadership keeps slapping themselves on the back and rolling the horrendous open office plan out to more and more buildings.

The IT infrastructure is nearly always broken, but somehow is reported as 99.9% available. The newer infrastructure is always failing, servers down, databases down, Hadoop unavailable or the data in bad state. This makes difficult to test and deploy code as you must wait for availability.
The reliable IT infrastructure technologies are being abandoned because they are not bright and shiny. A lot of technology for technology sake. Attempt to move everything to Pivotal Cloud Foundry with little thought of what business value is being provided. Meetings are like a tent revival, where everyone is making the trek down the aisle to be converted to the Cloud. Praise be, we had 30 conversions today.
Advice to Management
It is cheaper to rent office space where the IT talent exists - than to try to convince talented people Detroit is a good place to live. If every other successful tech company has figured out that you can attract and retain talent by going to where the talent is - why can’t you see this? Rent office space in Austin, Portland, Phoenix, Atlanta and Raleigh - and let IT talent work in any of these locations. You will be able to attract and retain talent then. All the Dearborn and Corktown building remodeling in the hopes of attracting people to Detroit is a pipe dream. 
You will continue to be left with the dregs or people who can’t leave Michigan.

Software Engineers aren't commodities or slaves. 
Please stop buying half-baked, unproven startups for $30-$40 Million and invest that capital into elite software engineering teams and projects within the company— not Chariot, Autonomic, Spin, Transloc. If not, buy a better startup for a billion or two. 
Fire racists and sexists much faster, otherwise it will cost Ford in more ways than one.

I worked for 6 years as a Financial Analyst at Ford, and I had unparalleled professional development at that time. The Finance function at Ford is one of the best in the world with decades of refined processes for budgeting and preparing business plans. There is a strong emphasis on the management team of providing analyst level employees with challenging assignments and high standards of work product and professionalism. Equally important is the emphasis on honesty and integrity, and I was never asked to modify any numbers in order to hit predetermined targets. The skills I learned in Ford Finance are highly transferable, and continue to make me a better Finance professional today.
","Ford is full of talented individuals, and there are not enough management positions to develop of the great talent they recruit each year. In order to distinguish oneself for promotion, one has to be willing to accept special projects, work long hours, and prove their loyalty to one's boss. Once I left Ford, I confirmed what I had already expected; that Ford's talent pool is so good that they're expectations for promotion are out of line with the rest of the manufacturing sector. A surplus of talent is a good problem for Ford, but can feel stifling for talented up and coming professionals.
Advice to Management
The next 10 years for the auto industry are going to be transformative, and the impacts on mobility and society will be profound. While there has been a lot of skepticism in the industry as to whether Ford can survive this transformation, I am confident that the talented team at Ford will figure out how to weather yet another storm. I wish my career and pension at Ford had advanced far enough that I could hunker down with you, but I am content to be a cheerleader from the outside. Management focus on the core business and fundamentals of financial survival continue to be the keys that will allow for re-investment in the future of mobility. Investors are finally beginning to realize that auto manufacturing is not something that can be easily learned by the IT industry. There is 100 years of expertise in what you do.

Most Management genuinely cares about its employees. 
New projects and jobs keep it fresh. 
Lots of different career paths. 
Ford is highly regarded as a place to train/gain experience. Many people get recruited for higher paying jobs after a few years. 
If you have a good boss you can put the work in and advance quickly. 
Very smart, hard-working coworkers. 
Pay is good (not great) but you get a lot of side benefits.
Very flexible work environment. 
Savings & stock matching is generous. 
Products are cool and interesting - Ford will have the best overall vehicle lineup in 3 years. 
Lots of regional offices across the country. 
Dearborn is ok, the surrounding areas in Ann Arbor, Plymouth, Canton, Birmingham and downtown Detroit are actually very nice places to live and commute from.
","Base pay is usually slightly lower than other OEMs. 
Health care is stupidly expensive (but that’s the case anywhere in the USA). 
If you have a bad boss they can stall your career. 
Management will often overpromise and underdeliver - ex: “tell us what you’d like your next position to be and we’ll support you.” 3 months later: “here’s a completely different job from the one you asked for, but we think you’ll like it too.”
Company has a PR problem with explaining its plans. 
Will often add significantly more responsibility without adding compensation. 
Talented people get picked off by higher paying companies because Ford is tight with the purse strings.

Alot of smart people that they should be encouraging to stay have been leaving just for this reason alone. 
-Much of the office equipment (chairs, tables, etc) at the plants, especially at Sterling Axle and Van Dyke, are filthy, dirty, broken, and unkept. Just an embarrassment to look at. My chair literally had what looked like poop stains on it!

","I left Ford when I was recruited into a better job offer, plain and simple. I planned to give 3 weeks notice as a courtesy to my team that I still highly respected so I could help them transition a new team member into my position during a very busy time in the project cycle. Beware, the day you give notice they immediately excuse you from work and cut you off no matter what date you list in your resignation letter. It seems they have a secret walk out policy. Don't bother giving notice until you're ready to leave the same day. I lost thousands and thousands of dollars in retirement money that would have vested in just a week had they honored a 2 weeks notice. I was promised two weeks additional pay and unused vacation in my exit interview and a month later I haven't received anything and have been trying for over two weeks to reach someone and find out what happened. They send you to an e-mail address that only responds every 4-5 days, and knows nothing. The person who gave me the promise never returned any of my calls until my wife called then emailed and referred me to the same phone number that knows nothing, well actually pretends to know nothing as I’ve called them enough now to get the feeling their responses are scripted. They give a pretense of helping me and answering my questions but we are still back at square one after over two weeks and I’ve had to rephrase my question about ten times and they still don’t get it. Ford touts how good they are at communicating but anytime I try to call and get information, no one knows anything (or maybe pretends not to) and I'm just referred to automated e-mail addresses and voicemails. Even as an employee we found out major company news from the mainstream news before they told their employees. Horrible communication. You can't find contact information anywhere to a live voice, probably on purpose. I wanted to leave in a friendly manner but instead they seem to have made false promises and treated me like outsider scum so I've lost all respect I had for them which is really sad. Thanks a lot Ford, it didn't have to be this way. If you plan on staying there the rest of your life then maybe you'll enjoy it if you can handle all the lack of productivity and frustration that might arise when trying to work with union employees and if you don’t mind a bonus that seems to be only a fifth the size of what the union workers get, but if you ever have to make a career change, watch out for the Corporate beast and be sure to make sure all your own interests are in line before you leave. Yes I’m bitter now, I’ve wasted so much time trying to get only what was promised to me and I wasn’t bitter when I walked in to give my notice or even when they walked me out the door although I was shocked. The last month of trying to work with completely clueless and incompetent Ford employees, policies and procedures has ruined it for me, zero customer service, and intentional avoidance. I’d be ashamed to drive a vehicle produced by a company run in such a manner and I can’t believe I worked for such a company, how sad.
Advice to Management
Don't make promises you don't intend to keep. Scrap the walk out policy. I understand you're afraid people will steal company secrets when they leave so you walk them out the door, but all this does is alienate them and harm your reputation in the long run. If they were really going to steal secrets they would have done that before they gave notice unless they are really brainless. Publish your employee handbook and policies online. Make contact information for departments available instead of hiding behind dead-end automated phone systems and e-mail addresses. Give better bonuses to your engineer and product developers, they can't be replaced by robots and it's a slap in the face to them every time they watch news coverage of the big bonuses line workers are getting every Christmas.

Advice to Management
Pay your employees what they are worth and provide affordable medical insurance and retirement plans. Your employees invest in your product its only fair you invest in them. The employees that have been with you more than 5 years is worth your investment... They have been with you when no one else could handle the hours and hard work.

Thu Jun 07 2018, Mechanical Engineer,"Livonia, MI",Current Employee ,Engineer at Ford,1,"I have really liked the people that I have worked with so far. Just like anywhere, you can find people who seem to be working against you, but by far the large majority of people are there to support you. It really feels like we are all working on the same team. The jobs here keep me busy and are engaging, I enjoy the tasks given to me.
","I don't know if this should be a pro or a con but you really get thrown into your job without much training. So, on the one hand, it is very difficult because you are new and have no idea how things are done around the company, but on the other hand, you learn very quickly and instantaneously gain a ton of experience. And, as I said before, people are generally very helpful when you have questions.
