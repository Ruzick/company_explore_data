The micromanagement destroys the work environment.

The manager only want to hire sponsored Indian people like him because he can put or lot of pressure on them and they cannot say a single word.

Thu Sep 27 2018,Anonymous,"Tyler, TX",Former Employee ,"Tyler Division Closed - December 09, 2016",1,"I LOVED my job at EOG Resources, Inc. and I was good at my job and I was compensated very well for the work that I performed and I would still be working there at the Tyler Division had it not closed. I worked 6.5 years and I was vested in the company. EOG Resources, Inc. had awesome benefits, health insurance, vacation policy, sick leave, SARS, etc. All things considered, EOG Resources, Inc. was simply the best company I have ever worked for and also the worst.
","Closure of the Tyler Division was a bitter pill to swallow and was totally not expected on my part. I knew the industry had not been doing well but never in my wildest dreams did I think the office would ever close. I mean, we had employees that had been working there for over 20 years. Other O&G companies had weathered the storm and I thought EOG would follow suit. Apparently I was wrong! Note to Management...Other options could have been explored and tried before ultimately closing the office. There were many cost saving opportunities that were missed and never implemented over the years. Opportunities for transfers could have been made a year in advance and a skeleton crew could have been left in Tyler since all our work is done electronically anyway without any employee losing their job. Because now here I sit almost 2 years later with over 3100 connections on LinkedIn, a bachelors degree, 9+ years of experience in the oil and gas industry, 25 years of total work history and I still can't find a job in Tyler, TX or surrounding area...not full time permanent, not temporary, not anything. I feel like there is a stigma associated with working at EOG and other companies won't even consider me for a job.
Advice to Management
There were a lot of cost saving measures that could have been implemented, enforced and weren't. A year in advance, Management should have called an all employee mandatory meeting and had a “Come to Jesus Meeting” with all staff and explained the situation and addressed their concerns and asked for cost saving ideas so the staff feel included with the decisions that are being made regarding their well fare. 
First, they could have said….in order to not have to close the office or lay anyone off this is what we are going to try and do to see if it will make an impact on the situation and give it 6 months to see if they can see a difference. 
First, Management could have offered voluntary transfers to those wishing to transfer to other divisions and offered a move allowance regardless of your employment level within the company as an incentive to move.
Second, Management could have offered a compensation package for those considering early retirement. I do recall that we did go through a couple of layoffs going back to 2014/2015. 
Third, Cut back on all expenses till further notice...No more business trips (do everything via teleconference); Meals (choose take out instead of restaurant); Meals (pay for self and no one else); Gas/Fuel (no meetings offsite, use teleconference or cell phone); Do not check out company vehicle (contact people via cell phone/teleconference); No business trips for training, educational purposes, Management Conference, etc. ; If you feel that you have to expense something then it must be pre-approved by your Manager, either via email or a note signed by your Manager and attached to your expense as a receipt; Cut back on food in the office (drinks, snacks, catering, etc.), etc.; We did consolidate the supplies (use what we have and if you want something else you will have to buy it yourself)and that was implemented; Sell off some company vehicles, sell off some office furniture, stop lease/rental of un-used office space (which they had just renewed a lease on office space for 18 months when they announced the company division closure); ETC… Once you implement those measures and they don't make an impact on the situation, then and only then should you consider a closure. At that point, you need to have another “Come to Jesus Meeting” and explain where you are regarding the status of the possible closure of the office. Then at that point if the decision is made to close the Tyler Division at least the employees know that EOG valued their input and tried to make it work but couldn’t. Then at that point, things could have been done to help those being laid off in finding other work locally. Employees were offered transfers to other locations. However, for some employees a transfer is not an option financially. For those employees that were going to be laid off and not transferring, local oil and gas companies could have been notified of the closure and a Job Fair could have been done in house with those participating companies to find the EOG employees other jobs. I feel that since the laid off employees were not to blame for the closure based on their job performance then management should have worked hard to find these employees other jobs. I am speaking only for myself because I have not been able to find another job for a year and nine months now and in December it will be 2 years I have been out of work. 
I am at my wits end because I don’t know what else to do at this point. I have applied for jobs online, signed up with 8 employment agencies/recruiters, networked with other EOG employees that I worked with in Tyler that found other jobs and have touched base with over 3100 employees on LinkedIn and still I sit here without a job. When I was hired to work at EOG it was a God send and being laid off from EOG has turned out to be my worst nightmare because no other company will even consider me. When did being over-qualified (educated, experienced and skilled) for a job become a bad thing?

","The culture is changing, and not for the better. Slowly becoming more ""corporate"", bureaucratic and political. Absolutely no telecommuting, little to no schedule flexibility depending on the GM of the division you work for, can be highly political depending on the department you work in, can be a highly political performance review process, basically no management training for supervisors (people are promoted based on their technical performance/age instead of their ability to actually manage people AND their technical ability, and management training is near non-existent so some managers are awful to work for), strange S&E hierarchy, ""perception is reality"" mentality, and often HR is absolutely useless for conflict resolution. I'm seeing more micromanagement creep into each division's culture, and lastly, I don't see a whole lot of women promoted to management positions, nor are most divisions friendly to working moms. If you are working mom, beware.
Advice to Management
Find a *good* and *thorough* management training program and implement it. Communicate with (train) employees on how to properly do a 360 review. Eliminate terrible managers and micro-management. Allow for flexible schedules and working from home for those departments that it makes sense to allow. Allow flexibility for working parents. Re-structure S&E in a more logical way. Possibly better train HR on mediation of conflicts. Performance reviews should be based primarily off of supervisor's review of employee, not people's opinions that aren't in the department and don't understand the employee's job. Lastly, supervisor's should actually understand and be able to do their employee's jobs, instead making someone a supervisor simply due to age.

Tue Jan 29 2013, Engineer II,"Fort Worth, TX",Current Employee ,"High exposure, loosely organized",2,"Little higherarchy, lots of responsibility and opportunity. If you work for the right person/department, it can be a great place to work and learn. Mostly a casual atmosphere, and there is always a get it done mentality. In the right groups or departments that are properly staffed and have good management attitude, it can be a great place to work.
","It's loosely organized which can be a positive or can be a negative when things get out of hand. There can be frustration in lack of guidance and direction. For some departments with the right people and leaders it works well, where others do more poorly. There can be a lot of snap judgements and whiplash back and forth when some more planning and foresight overall could be beneficial. You can also get the whisper at the top turns to a shout at the bottom (rigid conveyance of orders/information) with some leaders, where others are good about adapting to situations. It all depends on who you work for, as I'm sure is true with most organizations.

The performance bonuses are all supposed to be customized to every individual, but after several years working here, it seems like most people are on a promotion/raise schedule. There isn't much feedback to be able to differentiate. It is hard to tell if you're really doing well and if the ""you're doing a good/great job""s are significantly reflected in your compensation or not; I'm guessing long term they will be. From colleagues with the same experience I do, I would guess base salary is middle ground and bonuses are on the low side, especially considering the extensive vesting time (5 year cliff vest).
Advice to Management
A lot of valuable people seem to be under-paid. Most groups know who the winners are, and they should be compensated accordingly. I don't get to see the pay, but it seems like the spread from the ""A players"" to the ""C Players"" is not that much after they are hired (I could be wrong). A get it done attitude with managers is positive on the surface but can also be a caustic characteristic. It has to be done with flexibility or it can bypass the best solutions to a problem. A get it done manager that doesn't give much feedback is a good sign things are poor. A get it done where you hear feedback from the troops on the ground is a good sign. The managers I have dealt with seem to distinctly fall into groups of flexible and inflexible. Adapting to feedback and isisting it is done right is hugely beneficial to being a good manager.
