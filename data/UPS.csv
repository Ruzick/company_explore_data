Positive Outlook
No opinion of CEO
I have been working at UPS full-time
Pros
Amazing Benefits selection, Essential Business, Consistent hours and overtime, entry level, many growth opportunities, yearly raises of 3-5%, vacation increase over years worked (2 wks 1-5 years, 2.5 wks 5-10 yrs, 3 wks 10-15 yrs, 3.5 wks 15-20 yrs, 4 wks 20-25 yrs), Retire with 401k after 25 years of service, 401k match by company up to 10%, discounted UPS stock, various coupons from local businesses fo rworking with company
Cons
Job process changes constantly, management not vary communicative, processes do not always make the most sense/are the most efficient, overtime mandatory during peak and any time it is needed, slow seasons where you may only get 25-30 hours a week, 1st year of work vacation accrues monthly, may not take off during peak, vacation is based on seniority and only a certain amount of people per day may take off, those who take off full weeks take priority,
Advice to Management
I understand this is a large company and management is under constant pressure, as a team member that works hard it would be more encouraging to have more upfront communication about job processes. I would also like more clarification on what our main goal is (is it customer service or company service)

","The only con is while your children are young you give up a lot of family time..I never got to watch my kids play sports and missed a lot of their growing years...the job can be hard on your home life but if you can make it through those years you and your family will enjoy the financial freedom that UPS provides...and now I look forward to a prosperous retirement!...so hang in there all you young drivers...
Advice to Management
Ditch Orion ...95 % if your drivers are loyal and are out there to save time and miles !!! Orion puts ridiculous restrictions on them!!! especially in remote areas...and to upper management I would recommend you compensate your mid to lower management with the same excellent pay and benefits you give us drivers..when they see us drivers with better benefits it makes bitter management..everyone should be able to say they are proud and well compensated to work for UPS...it's what has kept UPS a cut above the competition quality employees for quality pay...

•Taught me how to be very well organized with paperwork and discipline with employees
•Learned how to be a great communicator with my employees and also management teams when it comes to meetings and presentations
•UPS has several different departments and moving parts. This experience has given me the knowledge on how larger companies work when it comes to the bigger picture. 
•In UPS you become very knowledgeable with OSHA and KETER regulations. (I have personally been audited my both throughout the years at UPS and have successfully passed with no findings)
•Gave me the experience with inbounds and outbounds of large companies
","•I work a night shift schedule (9pm-6am)
•The UPS Worldport Hub is so large with around 12,000-15,000 people working just night shift alone. It is really hard to build personal relationships with all the employees and multiple management teams. Would really like a more interactive family type atmosphere.

Advice to Management
During training, I learned everything necessary to get the job done, and my trainer was excellent. However, I would like to learn a little more detail on exactly how to sort packages and understand the reasoning behind the packages' labels. How do the numbers correlate with a delivery area, and can you look at the numbers to know what order you will deliver in without referring to the app to see the order? As time went on, I started to figure some of this out, but I was a little oblivious to this for a while. Looking back, I would like a better understanding of how I could have used the labels to make my job more organized and efficient from the beginning. 
Everyone was just so awesome at the North Lincoln location! I will go back in a heartbeat to do this job again!!

Advice to Management
At times I did not even feel that I was part of the company as if noone cared. I believe Driver Helpers should be asked by management how they are doing with the job and how they are feeling every once in a while through text or call so they actually feel like they are more like part of the company. As a driver helper I worked my azz off during the peak season, everyday I showed up when I was called in (never a definite schedule) you never know what time you'll be called in to work. And even missed out on time with family that came in town. Sometimes mananagement or even a supervisor is hard to get a hold of. Those things could be improved.

","1) Super low pay. They start developers at around 55-60k per year. So, you can imagine they only get bottom talent pool from local schools.
2) they still don't have ci/cd pipeline. They package their applications, take a server offline and then drop that in. This is in 2021.
3) super old tech stack and very boring tech work. 
4) technology there is from 80s so unless you don’t want to work on exciting tech stack and happy with 55k/year this place is not for you
5) no diversity at all
6) very top down management


Run away from this place and work at banks in JC or Manhattan that start devs at 95k per year.

Advice to Management
COMMUNICATE
Either with your subordinates or with your superiors, the only constant I hear is people having problems and those problems not being addressed. People on the floor often know of problems before management, and when management does learn of them, THEIR superiors often do nothing to change or fix the issues.
There can be no progress if problems are not known by the only people who can fix them.

","The company was slightly disorganized, probably because of the chaos of the holiday season. I could only work once I was contacted by a driver that needed help and that was usually inconsistent in time and the driver I was working with. If I had technical problems it was up to me to figure them out because there wasn't an easy way to get support. The job incentivizes hours worked over number of packages delivered which meant it was very lax and I easily could've taken advantage of it by not performing as efficiently as I could have.

","Management disorganized. If you Train new PVD Drivers you do not receive extra pay. Do not get on managers bad side, you will get less work. If you do a great job, going above and beyond do not expect a recommendation to be put in your employee file. Your viewed as temp to be used and forgotten. The website lists employment from Oct. 15th - Jan. 15. However this seasonal hub let people go on the 26th and kept texting, saying they might use you later. But never do. So do not think you will get full seasonal employment from what they advertise on their website. I worked at the start of the hub opening Nov. 8th until Dec. 24. So you basically only get two months work.

Don't broad side drivers with false accusations. Give more advance notice when letting people go for the season. If the PVD does well on the job put a recommendation in their file. Not just a pat on the back. But something to help them get rehired next year.

Advice to Management
Management needs to be hand on. That should include in the paperwork they sign when accepting the position. Show me your works; not just running your mouth. Education should be minimum of an associate degree and had at least 1 year previous package handler experience. These narrow down to quality bosses. Let go of lazy, no brain, boys and girls in adult bodies within the first week they are there. This lead to smart people stay; lazy/no brain get out. Trainers should be a package handler for at least one year before accepting the position . Teamwork is necessary in any business. However, holding people responsible for their own acts should be priority. 

Union employees are allowed to transfer to any location/any state that has a business need for any reason. This should allow before bringing in any outsider. Transfer to another state are allowed only for education purpose is nonsense. They should not have to quit and apply again from ground zero to a new location. 

Full medical coverages to employees only should no longer than 3 months. Limited medical coverages to spouse and dependents are no sooner than 1 year.

","Very low pay for industry standard. UPS tries to pay you as little as possible and makes the commission structure complex in order to do so. Your accounts are also constantly given obnoxious growth plans which you are responsible for attaining. when upper management has their favorites, they make it very apparent. Constant changes with what is expected of you. We like to call it the flavor of the month. 
A lot of tedious administrative work, I’d say this is a 60-70% customer service job and 30-40% sales.

Thu Dec 17 2020, Seasonal Hire,,Current Employee ,Seasonal/Permanent Hire,0,"One of the best companies you could work for! I am always telling myself. & everyone else that I wish I had considered UPS years ago? It’s one of the only organizations left that provides their employees with top of the line benefits, a pension, union protection (unless you go into management; BUT, you CAN GO BACK) promotes from within the same location due to seniority typically, but as long as you’re clear that you have ambition to keep going with your management team, they’ll support you! Also, the pay is top notch for anyone, especially when you don’t have to have any post-secondary education to work there, yet they will pay for you to do any education after only a few months! If you are smart enough for this you can potentially use the temp job “back to school benefits” and then you get rehired in their number one diver position starting at $100K without ever touching a package!
","Physically demanding, stressful situations, some interesting supervisors who should not be in management! The hours are slightly weird; I don’t know why they are that way? Need to be able to adjust to changing environments, it’s FREEZING cold in the HUB, lack of availability to contact anyone in your management team for emergencies, lack of communication between employees for cultural growth; likely due to the seasonal hires only being there for money & make it clear they’re going to leave! Some gossip, if you’re a woman who is slightly attractive, you’re gonna be a favorite of the other departments...USE THIS FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW YOU!
Advice to Management
Please STOP hiring/promotion of employees who may have some seniority, but have little to no management experience. While most supervisors are in their mid-late 20’s, it’s not a long-term healthy culture. Their clear lack of communication and needed continued support/training from each shifts management team is EXTREMELY clear! Also, there is some clear hostility between these younger supervisors, who are under pressure & take it out on employees who haven’t been able to even be effectively trained! Please STOP expediting any training processes. Allowing for those with less seniority to bid for jobs based on a merit program would be great! Also, there needs to be more than only 3 Women’s restrooms in the HUB as it’s not been updated for 33 years since being built.

You don’t have to wake every morning wondering if what your company does hurts or kills people, which it’s role during the pandemic does give you a sense of pride.
","UPS doesn’t care about anything they label as a support function, which is very shortsighted. They just see you as an extra cost. UPS is really good at making you feel unloved and like you work for a company that doesn’t see you as a person. A good example is how they expect management to pick up random shifts during peak season or other events while they don’t get paid anymore because they are salary. They also have a habit of stretching staff as much as possible, especially in support functions. Senior management is also notorious for offering a bonus/reward that either never gets offered to important staff or just seems like an insult when it’s barely a reward.
Advice to Management
UPS needs to show better appreciation for it’s people and needs to offer better pay. I have many options out there for similar pay for lesser roles with other companies. The company also has no right to pay different parts of the company significantly less for the same grade as other parts in the same area. If UPS wants excellent people to work for the company then it needs to stop looking at to an accountant that will cut the legs it stands on. They also need to stop acting like they “own” you when you’re salary. People often refuse to be salary at UPS because of how you can work people whenever you want on salary. 

See people as an investment that pays back to the company and not as a situation where you low ball their pay and benefits to the what gets you by. Also, show some genuine appreciation that is effectively felt by your people and not a cheap attempt at it. Same thing with many other aspects of the company because we sometimes don’t spend money on things that really should be seen as essential.

I was layed off on Christmas day with no notification at all. The following week I was called off work every single morning until I finally gave up. I could have made money elsewhere but they had me thinking I would be employed through January. They didnt care about me at all.

","Upper management is horrible. Supervisors aren’t terrible depending who you get. There’s zero communication among UPS. Nobody ever knows what’s going on with UPS as a whole. Employees get zero recognition for hard work unless you count a cookie on employee appreciation day. You get worked extremely hard for very little incentive.
Advice to Management
