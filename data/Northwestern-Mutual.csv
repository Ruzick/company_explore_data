The amount of resources and information available to you is great.

You will meet a lot of great people you can learn from.
","This company is all about the ""bait and switch"". This goes for how they treat their staff as well as their clients. As a rep/advisor you will be told you are ""working for yourself"" and a ""business owner"" and ""making your own schedule"". All of this is largely false. You will be treated like an employee and micromanaged. You will be forced to over pack your calendar and report all your daily activity. You will be forced to do things the ""northwestern mutual way"" or else receive disrespect, insults, and threats from management. 

You will have to generate your own leads through somewhat disingenuous sales tactics. 

The sales cycle is overly long, complex, convoluted, and rigid. More so than necessary, which can cost you sales. 

In your first year, you will be pressured to do ""joint work"" whether you like it or not.. which eats into your commissions as you must split your commissions with your partner. 

The true purpose of joint work is to allow NM to keep your clients if you don't work out. Since most reps don't make it past their first year, this is a good way to exploit new reps.

You will not be able to move at your own pace. You must move at the pace management wants or else (so much for being a business owner/working for yourself hahaha) 

Its a ""bait and switch"" company in every way. Rather than being upfront with people about what they're getting into (both clients and staff) they will sell you a dream, then change the terms in their favor once you commit. Like that girlfriend or boyfriend who begs you to commit, then cheats on you. Many of the sales reps behave this way with clients as well. 

If you're a client, expect flaky and unreliable behavior from your advisor once you become a client. They are too busy chasing new business to provide good customer service after a sale. This attitude comes from the top though. 

If you are considering working here, think of it like visiting a new city. Take it all in, learn a few things, and LEAVE. This is a great place to visit but no place to live. You can make twice as much money working half as hard somewhere else.
Advice to Management
Cut the shenanigans. Just be upfront about what Northwestern Mutual is all about. You don't need to sell clients and reps a dream. Be straight forward about what you offer clients and reps and let the company's success speak for itself.

The core product and financial situation make it a great company with a lot of potential for company growth and transformation. It has a stated philosophy that supports innovation and Diversity and Inclusion.
","While the leadership states that innovation is important, that message doesn't necessarily trickle down. In some of the functions, the voices speaking for same old/same old get heard more than those advocating for change. 

In terms of advancement, networking and who your advocates are seems to carry more weight than ability and demonstrated skills, particularly for women. There doesn't seem to be a lot of space given for discussion of internal structural change in some areas, unless it's dictated from senior leadership. Individuals who toe the party line and don't disrupt seem to be more likely to advance, men in particular.

I truly didn't have many cons in my first few years here. It seems great at first, due to the stated company priorities and culture statements, but after a while it's evident that the company doesn't operate in accordance with the statements, at least in some departments. Gender bias is very evident and internal politics is more important than ability/capability; which doesn't give me a ton of confidence in the future direction of some departments.
Advice to Management
Change the internal hiring process. Gender bias is prevalent throughout the company if you look at who has advanced internally and at what stage in the career/tenure at NM. 

Also, engagement doesn't just mean getting along with people and having friends. It's about feeling as if what you're doing has purpose, it doesn't matter how social the teams are. Instead of making sure that every single person dictates what they want to do, working on getting them engaged in what NM is doing while at the same time being fulfilled. People leaders need to be developed to do that. 

Reward transformative thinking and voicing of opinions.

I worked at Northwestern Mutual full-time for more than a year
Pros
Resume booster. Great upside to make money. If you can sell life insurance, you can sell anything and this is the place to be if you can do just that.
Cons
That's all it really is, life insurance. Very little actual advising goes on and the training process is basically a crash course on calling and annoying your friends and peers. Leadership is put into the hands of people who either have no experience as an actual rep or successful reps who will take from your contact list until you ultimately leave the business and they keep whatever clients you guys have put together. If you don't sell insurance, you don't make money. The bonus structure and incentive package is nice, however ultimately relies on you to again - sell life insurance.
Advice to Management
Continue to make sure that the people in charge are actually doing what they're supposed to, which is training the reps. Having someone who has never actually been a representative ""coach"" the new reps, doesn't make very much sense. As well as having an MD who is behind par in his own practice.. I would also say to monitor who the recruiters are bringing in more. It seems like any person on any day can get at least an internship there nowadays.

","Working there feels like a pyramid scheme. They have asked to contact many of my friends about interviews. They don't hardly pay you anything unless your produce or sell for them. You get a $1,000 stipend for the summer for being an intern and attending continued development meetings. You are expected to find your own clients and hold meetings with them and split the profits with another advisor that works on the case with you.

And I don’t mean 2-3 and that’s it. They expect you to ask for at least 3 people EVERY time you meet. So you may have 3-4 meetings before they even buy life insurance and you are to ask every time.

","Do not be fooled. Management only cares about money and bottom line. They will butter you up and act like they care about you and your career and will conduct many interviews and tests to see if you fit their culture. In reality, you could be the worst person in the world but as long as you are getting clients and slanging their insurance then they will love you.

NM is a very cheap company. They take pride in not giving their employees benefits and make them pay for everything. Even if you leave the company, they will send you a large bill even though they mention nothing about it. They will do everything in their power to not pay you money, even when you do as they ask and all the things you are supposed to do. 

It is good experience but it is very difficult to make money, and they will try to lessen the amount of money you make as much as they can. They are the epitome of what is wrong with big corporations. They only care about money and that comes at the expense of the employees. 

This company likes to portray a feeling of values, family, and morals but it’s all to bring in more money.
Advice to Management
Pay your representatives a salary. Pay them what you tell them you are going to pay them. Stop trying to get ex employees to give you money back. A billion dollar company going after young employees for a few hundred dollars is despicable and desperate.

Good leadership from the managing director, though they have financial incentive to do so. Good support from senior advisors, again though, because they have financial incentive to do so.
","They don't give you leads, it's 100% dependent on you selling to people you know. You do little financial advising in the big scheme, and almost entirely sales for insurance and asset acquirement. Senior advisors often take +60% of the commission split. There's a HUGE gap between what anyone less than 5 years in the business can make, and what the senior advisors are making. High control over what you can post or say or do or think about NM.

","Completely lied to since day 1 of the interview process. They make you believe that you will be helping your friends and family while making a lot of money, but at the end of the day, all you are doing is being forced by higher-ups to push expensive whole life policies. They expect you to obtain 60 new clients in one year, which is absurd for someone who is fresh out of college that does not have a strong network of people who have money. The training is a joke, its two weeks of sales tactics and nothing about the products. They practically force you to do joint work, which means you have to split half the commission. After a month on the job, you have called everyone you know and are at a crossroads. The people prey on young college graduates to obtain new clients.

Wed Aug 19 2020,Anonymous,"West Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,Interning at Northwestern Mutual,0,"Northwestern Mutual fosters an environment that truly rewards you on your hard work. Through joint work partnerships, interns are able to work closely with full-time reps, all while building their own clientele. There are so many people in the office to reach out to, and many people that help you through the internship, so you'll never feel abandoned or stuck due to a lack of guidance. Furthermore, this internship gives you the opportunity to be independent, and take on the financial services industry in your own way! Essentially you create your own schedule and work on your own time, so what you put in is what you get out of it!
","This semester, the internship was forced to take on a new form, due to COVID-19. Because the internship was mostly online, there were many unprecedented hiccups with the process of getting paid and getting licensed. As a result, many interns were underpaid for their work, and many did not receive the special attention they would have in more normal conditions. Regardless of this, the West Hartford team did their best to accommodate for the lack of an in-person experience, and the members were always easy to reach via phone and email.

launch better female support systems since it is a highly male dominated field. Also, dont pretend to financially support new representatives with bonuses and such when you do not pay out on them (or make it incredibly difficult to pay out, when you spend a month of work trying to make them), Try to make management change smoother, the reason many people leave is because managing directors can run free and make any regulations they deem fit, so when someone is hired under a different management with the impression that their methods are how the firm will be run and that drastically changes with very little time it is off putting.

","*Work-Life Balance is a myth. If you want a life outside of NM, you won't survive. Long work days, an expectation to be available even when on vacation or on weekends/holidays, and the only people who get breaks are parents. 

*Sexism and racism are unfortunately in existence at NM, especially within technology. Terrible people who step on others are the only ones who succeed in a company that is powered by a ""good ol' boys club"". People who speak out against the toxic culture are seen as a threat.

*This company is in survival mode. They have no idea how to innovate or connect with young people. Everyone knows this because they refuse to upgrade old systems or invest in ways to connect with young people. Upper management is out of touch with reality while the company as a whole is in a downward spiral.

","Working at Northwestern Mutual was the biggest mistake of my life. I joined the company with hopes of creating a career for myself where I could determine my own schedule and be my own boss. I couldnt have been more wrong. To start, they force you to call all of your friends and family and be vague about wanting to meet with them. If they agree to it, they train you to use high pressure sales tactics to paint a picture of the worst possible scenario that could happen to them (if you want to sell a lot of disability or life insurance, they want you to to sell a lot of disability or life insurance, they want you to make the client afraid of death or disability). If they disagree and say they dont need insurance, you are trained to essentially insult the client and say that they dont love their family if they dont buy from you. I lost many friends because of this and it made many family gatherings extremely awkward. Even if you can get a large number of your friends and family to buy insurance, they set such high production requirements that they essentially try to remove you from the business in 1 year. But why would a company try to have such high turnover But why would a company try to have such high turnover around the 1 year mark? Because Northwestern Mutual is essentially an elegant pyramid scheme. They bring you in, screw you over, and take all of the phone numbers from you when you leave so they can harass your friends and family even after you've left. On top of that, the way you are paid for selling an insurance policy is they give and family even after you've left. On top of that, the way you are paid for selling an insurance policy is they give you the full 13 months premium payments from the sale and if that client decides to cancel or cannot afford the premiums anymore, guess who forks up the bill? YOU DO! I left the company 6 months ago and have paid them over $13,000 through mafia like extortion tactics that they use. They dont explain why you owe them more money, they just send you a bill and deduct absurd amounts of money from your savings. They assume that it is the reps fault that some one would cancel but they is the reps fault that some one would cancel but they dont take into account events like covid putting pressure on clients to pay high rates for something they cant afford. The managing partners at each office is set because they are the top of the pyramid scheme while they destroy all the people coming in that are new to the they destroy all the people coming in that are new to the business. I followed every training action they told me to do and I was treading water from day one. They promised that it would get better if i kept calling more and more people i knew, but it never did. If anyone is reading this and is considering working for Northwestern Mutual, DONT! If you know anyone considering working here, please show them this and warn them. The Northwestern Mafia will drain and beat you down all so the Mob boss (managing partner) can add another 0 to his income.

Make prospecting easier for advisors by giving them leads. I come from a low-income neighborhood with a culture that doesn't just give out numbers for referrals. People like me have to struggle and work 60+ hours per week to get 1 policy signed just to make $100 because my friends and family don't have money and they're not acquainted with people who have money. This job is LITERALLY designed for privileged individuals who know welathy people. While it's possible to succeed otherwise, it's very difficult and you must climb barriers that others who come from wealthy families simply don't have to (INCLUDING COLD CALLING). In my office of over 20 advisors, there were only 2 people of color including myself. Why? Well, because the system is simply rigged against us. Again, it's still possible to succeed but very difficult with all the barriers to entry AND, not to mention, the pandemic.

Put less stress on incoming reps. There is a 95% fail rate for a reason. Consider investing in a base salary for 1st year reps so they can truly focus on PLANNING and doing what is in their clients best interest rather than worrying about their next paycheck. 

Teach more about how the products work specifically. There is so much teaching about the sales side and the mentality side, and not enough on specific products or planning tools. You can't and shouldn't expect new reps to just blindly trust that the products are superior to others.

There's too much of an expectation for people to come in and crush it with little to often zero experience in the industry. Reduce the feeling of failure associated with not hitting numbers in reps first year and give people a chance to catch their footing rather than get jaded by the career.

Fri Apr 10 2020, Financial Representative,,Current Employee ,Understand what you're signing up for...,14,"I've been at Northwestern Mutual for almost 5 years so feel like I have a good understanding... 
Northwestern Mutual is a successful, large, and profitable company that has amazing resources and training. I have really appreciated my time here and learned a ton, but I definitely wish I better understood what I signed up for when I chose to become a financial representative (see ",". 
The leadership is great and I felt they truly care. The training is solid and the amount of resources and training NM provides is outstanding. 
In the role you get client facing experience right away which is good and NM will pay or reimburse for any/all certifications and training. 
Although you have to work your butt off to succeed, you DO have a lot of flexibility with your schedule as you are basically running your own business.
Cons
I was a in the Financial rep/advisor role for 4 years (so I didn't just fail out after one year and I'm complaining now).. 
When you accept a role as a financial rep/advisor, you are agreeing to become a business owner. You MUST remember that. To be a successful business owner, you must be profitable! The way to be profitable in this role (and still do the right thing for the client) is to be working with high net worth individuals / high income earners / established families. Your market matters SO MUCH. If you move laterally in mid/low levels of income (even if you are generating A LOT of new clientele), you WILL fail out. It's just math... and unfortunately so many people buy into the ""Granum"" system of just doing an insane activity and getting referrals to everyone with a pulse, they forget how they actually make money. Granted, a lot of activity does matter, but you make money by doing transactions with those who can actually afford to do larger amounts of planning. 
The model of NM is very old school. The ""Granum"" activity model is pushed as if there is no way you can possibly fail if you do Granum. The issue is that model was specifically for selling one product - Life Insurance. Nowadays, a financial rep/advisor at NM is expected to do FULL PLANNING - insurance, investments, retirement, etc. Which although is a good shift for the company, without a background in financial planning it is simply TOO MUCH INFORMATION for any brand new person to comprehend in just a few months. I don't think they have acknowledged that really... AND the amount of extra work you have to do that you get paid very little on (brokerage accounts, Roth IRAs, etc.)... it's so time consuming! Again - If you do not see high income earners and established families, you simply won't make money. I can't stress that enough. 

You CAN make a lot of money in this role and have a ton of flexibility in your career. I see it around me. With that said, the industry is changing and NM is slow to adapt. The success rate to even make it past your first 2 years is less than 20% .. and making it to your 4 or 5 year mark is like 10%.. and actually making it past that and MAKING MONEY (because many make it to 4 or 5 years but are broke / in debt), is probably 5% or less. 
Understand what you're signing up for... if you have a great market, or are willing to focus on creating a great market, AND you put in the activity, you can have success. With that said, I would not recommend this to any friends or family because of the extremely high likelihood of failure and losing money.
Advice to Management
Adapt - look at Granum training model considering it's not just selling life insurance anymore, and focus more training on profitability and understanding how to run a business.

Thu Apr 02 2020, Financial Advisor,,Current Employee ,Misleading First Year Compensations,6,"Work culture is generally positive and sincere.
","Misleading pay scale used for the hiring process. Not one Managing Partner or Managing Director, when questioned, seems to recall how they calculated their numbers. Yet, it's still being used with potential new-hires in order to entice them to apply. Specifically, the interview process shows $93k in average compensation for the 50th percentile of performers in their first year. However, NOT one rep or advisor in our region has ever agreed with the validity of such unchecked claims. It's rather disappointing that NM lacks integrity when compliance doesn't have an interest with regard to disclosures for new hires.

Mentorship is unreliable. I found my mentor to be rather immature and makes numerous comments that showed his lack of intellect. He's fine to have a beer with and watch a sports game, but not someone that should be allowed to manage even a small team.

Nepotism doesn't escape NM. Our local office has a new FR who is the son of one of the largest practices in the country. MPs and MDs have spent several meetings praising how he has managed to break all records for our region. They fail to realize that because of his father he's able to experience quick success. Established FRs and advisors are not appreciating this obvious bias especially when the new FR happens to have a mentor that is the MD of the region. Yet, that same MD does not offer any mentoring to any other reps. Such peculiar arrangement has led to quiet resentment amongst reps and advisors.
Advice to Management
For new hires, provide and disclose a legitimate pay scale that's been audited by Home Office (HO). NM spends so much time on compliance with its reps, but doesn't seem to care if misleading numbers for pay entice recruits to become new hires. 

Perception is reality. If you endorse nepotism with a smile people will see right through it. While this is not to say that children of successful practices should not apply it is discouraging and unacceptable to see favoritism without merit.

Company culture, learning opportunities for every department, they encourage development of skills, great people, community based & supports by volunteering. Great products and services offered. I truly believe NM offers better products than any Financial company out there.
","I started in recruiting (2 years) and moved into the Financial Representative role (8 mos). In recruiting, there wasn't any opportunity to advance. I loved everything about the company but I wanted to grow into my role, and didn't have the chance to do so. I never felt heard. Being a female in a male dominate industry, my Managing Partner never let me speak. It was discouraging and lead me to switch roles. If you do not have A LOT of money in savings or a spouse to lean on, or parents paying for your living expenses, this will not be for you. 100% commission is hard. I went 7 months, with 6 clients and never saw a penny. They charge for small expenses like the phone and printer, which can take away any little commission you might make. Can this be worth it in 5 years? Heck yea. But it's a hard road to go down. I started with $8K in debt and my Managing Partner said it would be fine with a single income. A Director suggested I take out a loan to get through?!? A financial company giving me the worse advice. 7 months in, I had to quit because I was $20K in debt.
Advice to Management
Be up front with the slow process of training. I was there 7 months, learned a lot but probably 10% of what I needed to do the job well. Be up front with the commission. If someone is single, no help with income and in debt - this will not work for them. Stop talking about the advisors who have been there 10 years and make a million a year. That's not realistic. You can mention them, but make the biggest focus on the fact that you won't see high commission numbers for 2-3 years.

Also it's easy to get nothing accomplished and still get paid, because NM doesn't understand what competence means. That's what happens when you have old school insurance folks trying to ""innovate"" themselves.
","You get promoted based on tenure, not performance. People become team leads or get promoted into senior positions because they've been at the company for a while, or because everyone else on the team left and they need someone to fill the role, even if that person isn't the most qualified. You work on such a small piece of the company's initiatives that you have no real transferable skills elsewhere. Most of the engineers that are still around are junior or incompetent or lazy, because all the good ones know they're better than this place and left. Most of the so-called product managers especially in Milwaukee are people going through a mid-life crisis but couldn't actually explain to you what product management is and can't execute anything beyond changing a button from white to blue. The designers are generally great, but poorly utilized and have to work with idiots from the Milwaukee office all the time who think about design the way we thought about it in the 90's. The marketing team is competent only because marketing's senior leadership is actually competent. Everyone else is forgettable, including the NY office manager who has an ego problem but rarely does his job.

","- they sell it as being self-employed, with high earning potential in the first year. Reality- you have crazy metrics and expectations put on you with NO experience, NO leads and NO background in the industry. You have no incentive, because you aren't getting paid to dedicate ALL your time to calling people. Referrals which are made to sound like they are just handed to you left and right by family and friends, are indeed, Not. So not only are you cold-calling, you are not given the time you need to build up a client base. You are spending WAY more money before you see a dime. Now, could this all work out in 5 years? Sure, but not all of us have a wealthy spouse to lean on or 100K in savings. So if you are not VERY financially secure, this is Not a position that is worth your time or even financially feasible.

Lots of nice people. Clean, safe work environment. Casual dress. The free lunch is cool and a community builder, though not very appetizing.
","Technologically this department is woefully behind. It suggests this department is of little consequence to NM as a whole. I also agree with a number of the negative comments here that refer to the inability to got PTO requests approved despite them being long-standing. You are literally a slave to their forecasting without anyone realizing how absurd the set-up is - those who have worked in other call centers can surely attest to how ridiculous it is that a PTO request pending since November should remain unapproved in the following June or August... there is also a lot of favoritism and a lack of uniformity for how management deals with employee concerns. Some managers will manager approve PTO requests, for example, while others will not. The union here is effectively useless and holds low membership yet management blames many things which are clearly their discretion on the union... also, if you are absent you will be treated like a criminal and talked down to like you are a child. If you missed a day last February and then two days in January you will be on thin ice and talked to about your attendance. There are people who will literally come in vomiting, hacking to death, etc.. spreading disease. There are a number of things I find very odd about the way the department is managed. Managers are in meetings for hours at a time multiple days a week... what do they do? Not our job, that's for sure. Their positions are rewards for service and being favored. Your career growth is 100% determined by how popular you are with ""leadership"". This is good place for followers who do not challenge the status quo or people whose professional experience is so limited they do not understand some of the glaring flaws and absurdities. Also, you pay to park in the parking structure even though it is a private structure just for the Franklin location... ????? Health benefits are not that great.

You really can't trust anyone at this company as even those in leadership are constantly fighting for power amongst themselves. Bullying is actively encouraged so long as you're on the right side and under the MP's protection. The MP by the way is one of the most egotistical delusional people I have ever come across. He is not interested in growing his business, simply in making quick profits. And if he doesn't like you it doesn't matter how hard you work, you'll constantly be blamed for everything that goes wrong. If they offer you a raise you can expect it to take several weeks before you actually see it on your paycheck if at all. 
 
On top of the HR issues, there are several other more insidious issues. Insurance agents lie on their clients medicals in order to get clients better rates. Honestly I'm surprised this place hasn't been sued.

For college students and young professionals they will try and convince you saying it’s rated the “#1 internship for finance majors” which is complete BS.

Thu Jan 02 2020, Financial Advisor,"Tulsa, OK",Former Employee ,A wonderful opportunity for entrepreneurs and self-directed individuals who want a community to work within,11,"I worked with the company for a total of almost eight years. I was an intern for 2.5 years, a financial advisor for 5.5 years, and during that time I was also a College Unit Director for a year. They do a lot of training and hand-holding in the very beginning, but once you've proven yourself you get a lot of autonomy. You are a statutory employee which means you get some benefits similar to traditional employees (health insurance, 401k, pension, and life and disability insurance, etc.). However, there are some things that are very much like running your own business. For the most part, you set your hours (so long as they are around internal meetings) and you get to decide who you work with. If you're not interacting with a specific client well you aren't required to work with them. At the office I worked at there was an amazing work culture and I truly felt supported. They try to keep an abundance mentality where you're working hard to help build up the other advisors and compete with them in a healthy manner. It's not cutthroat and no one has to lose for you to win. There truly is no ceiling on how much you can earn and what you can achieve there. If you want to work in management and help with new advisors, there's a path for that. If you just want to focus on your financial planning practice that's encouraged as well. 

There are several ways to build up your streams of income so you consistently have money coming in. In the very beginning, it's heavily insurance-focused because it pays the most immediately. Over time you start to increase your investment assets, have group benefits, and renewals coming in to make sure there's always some sort of cashflow. 

The company is also very centered on doing what's best for the client and making sure that your actions result in their best interest. That's what drew me to the company initially when I was just 20 was because everyone wanted to do right by the client and that stayed consistent my entire time there. From the president and CEO all the way to inside each office and down to each new training class.
","This career is NOT for everyone and can be a very isolating experience with a lot of ups and downs. You will feel more rejection than you've ever felt before. Not every client says yes and the process can take a toll on someone. Also, a lot of people think they're hard workers until it comes to working alone; then you realize how easy it is to put work off and decide to take an afternoon off when you should be working. 

There can also be a lot of overhead, similar to owning your own business, that can bog you down if you don't have adequate savings or a partner that can help when commissions get tight. There's no base, so you can have actual paychecks that are $0 or even negative. Over time you get used to it, but if you have a couple in a row it can cause a lot of strain. 

You are not given leads (although you can get into a couple of programs that help pair you with call-ins or existing clients whose advisors have left). Often times people take this to mean you have to work with friends and family. They encourage you to meet with your friends and family to, at the very least, prospect, but don't require it and help give you language to work with people they know instead of working with them directly. If this isn't done correctly though you can come off as really sales-y or pushy. I did actually have my interactions with some friends and family become strained because I either pushed too hard or they didn't feel they could say no and chose to ghost instead. I've seen times where it's my fault and times where it's theirs for not being mature enough to deal with the situation. At the end of the day though if the relationship is strong enough and you're coming from a good place your reaching out to them shouldn't cause any issues. 

They also work off a pretty rigid system that doesn't always work for everyone in regards to how they measure metrics and gauge success. It's a proven system, but can be antiquated in areas that have seen technological advancement over the last few years. The ratios haven't been updated in a while and what works for you may not work well for others and vice versa.
Advice to Management
My advice to management would be to figure out how to work with each individual and not just rely on prior management tactics to coach every new advisor. I was one of the first females of color at the agency I worked at and was also not married and didn't have children. The traditional advisor is a white male, often with a wife at home, and a couple of kids. When it comes to motivating that type of person, it's really straight forward and has been outlined well since the company started. I, however, was not motivated in the same way and that was frustrating to the management team at times because they had to get creative in helping me get out of my own way. Almost everyone I worked with though was open to figuring out how to work with me though, so I had a positive experience with this. Some of my colleagues in other offices weren't always so lucky though. They saw no reason to change because it was still working for other people.

Sat Jan 25 2020, Financial Representative,"Iowa City, IA",Current Employee ,Amazing & Fulfilling Role,1,"You are your own business owner. The fulfillment I get from genuinely helping my clients is immeasurable and means the world to me. The gratitude from the people I have helped means more than all of the money that I am making/will make. The money comes with helping people. Don't worry about the money. If you do a good job and keep your promises to the people you work with then you will be successful. If you work hard you will be successful and earn the right to make your schedule however you want to. It's entirely up to you. Sink or swim as your own business owner. I couldn't imagine working for the same salary every other week. BORING!
The company itself is amazing. It has been around for 160+ years and only continues to thrive and get better at everything it does. John Schlifske is the man! Don't look at what people say online about it. If you talk to clients of NM advisors and financial planners, they will tell you the truth. It's an amazing and ethical company that always does the right thing. How often can someone say that about their company? It's not a publicly traded stock company so they are never trying to make a quick buck off of your clients or you.
","You either sink or swim as a financial advisor. You are your own business owner. People are going to help you but they won't put in the work for you. That isn't their job. If you don't have a solid work ethic and genuinely enjoy improving the lives of others, you need not apply. You won't make it.

The ability to create a financial planning practice that gives you the income from insurance and investments will help you weather changing market conditions over time and significant income as you help your clients achieve their financial goals and objectives.
","Incentive based compensation makes for a challenging start. There is a lot to learn to become good at financial planning but there are also many avenues for ongoing training. Problem is that it is up to the individual reps to stay focused on training at all times and many people aren’t ready to put in the time and effort it takes to be successful.

Keep looking for the talented, entrepreneurial type people that should engage in this type of work. The career is very attractive once someone is successful and that likely lures some of the wrong people to really want the opportunity from the start.

Tue Oct 15 2019, Wealth Management Advisor,"La Jolla, CA",Current Employee ,Phenomenal Opportunity - for the right person,9,"I'm 10 years into a phenomenal career. I always wanted to have my own business. I have tremendous freedom in terms of how I work and how I spend my time. There is no other career I know of that provides such an optimal balance between incredible earning power/success and quality of life. Many of my clients make high 6 and 7 figure incomes. I wouldn't trade places with any of them because they all sacrifice significantly on lifestyle to make that income; they're all working 70 or 80 hours a week, constantly traveling, and they will be for the rest of their careers. I make mid 6 figures (about $500,000), my income grows meaningfully each year, and I probably am out of the office for about 2 months in total each year. It doesn't get any better. Oh, and I have company-funded pension and 401(k) plans. It's a phenomenal long-term opportunity to start a business without any money out of pocket and with very little downside risk.
","Must be ok with meaningfully delayed gratification. Must be a self-starter. This career isn't for most people because it's hard. Not intellectually, but rather it requires significant drive and someone that's willing to work for a long time to actually build something (ie a business) as opposed to someone that just wants to show up, work hard, and get paid (like in a normal job) but without any meaningful long-term wealth or income earning potential. 

** This is not a good fit for most people - they simply don't have the drive or tenacity - but for the right person looking to build an incredible business and lead an incredible life it's a 10/10 **

Advice to Management
Be more honest about recruiting. I know you only keep 1 in 10 hires, so new blood is always needed, but they weren't completely honest with questions I asked during interviewing. Allow a more flexible on-boarding timeline with regards to training to allow people to have all licensing prior to start. Allow for transitional or part time work for open case work for people who decide to leave. It's a clear win win for you regardless, and while there's a lot of training and support, it doesn't appear retention is truly cared about. With such a high failure rate, it's a feature of the system you operate, not a bug in the system. There's no reason it should be this way.

-The business/career allows you to make intimate and meaningful impact in the lives of clients
-The schedule is flexible and allows time with family when and where you need it/want it
-The work environment is team-oriented despite everyone having individual goals
-You work with some seriously talented planners that help guide and mentor you
-Your personal familiarity with complex, long-term finance will grow
-Awesome culture around continued development and learning, even ""relentless"" in this area sometimes
-Your personality and your individuality can be your best business asset in this role - I have seen many advisors that very strategically choose a market that fits who they are and who they want to work with

You are constantly identifying problems and addressing the underlying operational issues - it is actually the fun part for a true business owner!

They have trainings and seminars that you always have to pay for (haha) but they are packed with great info.
","- NO BASE PAY. 
- LONG DAYS (with no pay)
- SPLIT ALL OF YOUR CAES (with senior agents who know what they're doing: because you have to ""pay to play"")

They will build a dream of selling 100-250K a year by year 4. The product is not a good recommendation for clients: so selling becomes hard since you're selling off of referrals and once you learn enough about permanent life insurance you realize 99% of the people you're pushing it on would be better served putting their money into other vehicles. 

You aren't a captive agent, but you really are. The only products that are tied to your performance bonus and metrics are the proprietary Northwestern Mutual products. The product is simply not competitive once you learn about what other insurance carriers are selling term and permanent coverage for: so selling this creates a moral dilemma of doing what you know is right or doing what you need to pay your bill?

GO LEARN ELSEWHERE: the learning being the only pro isn't bad for someone fresh out of college doing the internship. You will learn relentless hard work ethic that will benefit you when you decide to get a real job 6 months after ""volunteering"" at Northwestern Mutual. 

This is a glorified pyramid scheme that is better than the World Financial Groups and Primericas of the world: though not by much.

Wed Aug 21 2019, Financial Advisor,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Forewarned is Forearmed (Park Ave. office in Midtown NYC),24,"Training program is great. The experience is transforming. Many people are sharp and some of the best in the business. NM's insurance products are some of the best in the industry.
","I went into the FASTRACK training program as a career changer and had done some due diligence as to where to go to get into a career as a financial advisor. And although I got some good advice from people outside of the Northwestern Mutual bubble, nothing they told me really prepared me in the way that I wish I had been prepared.

First, you must understand that NW has a duality. There is a NW ""cult"" like mentality which will impact each office around the country. That cult is that NM is THE BEST and that by hooking up with them you, the rep, are ELITE. But at the same time each NW office around the country has it's own personality.

If you leave NM (and it is more likely than not that you will because of their business model) and if you choose to stay in the field of insurance or financial advising, be warned: If you don't stay beyond several years you will never see the residual payments that make insurance sales lucrative. I left after 18 months and went to a firm with only a loose affiliation with another insurance company. What I left behind was much of the second year and future payments that would make my ""start up"" phase easier.

Be warned: NM's business model is very clear: they will milk you for all of your contacts and push you hard (harder than you might be able to stomach) to make sales. They will tell you the only way to land business at the start is to do ""joint work"" (which is pretty much true for most people) but that means giving up 50% of your commissions. The people that you do joint work with will look upon you as a cannon fodder. They pretty much know that you won't be around in a six months or a year or two and they will smile and be nice to you but most of them won't take the time to really teach you or help you learn simply because they don't want to spend time doing so. No, they will happily help you close business and reap the perpetual rewards of the business you tee up for them but very few will really do much to help you. If you ask for (which I did) a split fee other than 50% (say you ask for 60%) they will likely chuckle and flip you off. They know you have little power to negotiate because your back is against the wall because you have a quota you must meet.

The biggest reason not to work for NM is that you will be asked to sign a contract. That contract you sign will pretty much lock you into selling NM product. No one will likely go out of their way to do what is best for the client and show them options from other carriers. This fundamentally irritated me as I want to do what is best for my clients.

On the investments side, I did three deals with about a total of $400k of AUM. Because NM does not encourage you to work towards your FINRA licences until you've been there a while (they want you to focus on selling insurance), if you end up with a client with investments, you will not get any monetary benefit from your client (I know I personally did not get into this business to enrich the bank accounts of colleagues who don't care if you stick around.)

Watch out for your joint work partners: they might be ""good guys"" and they're all super charming (except for me in one case a guy who really was repugnant and screwed me over by excluding me from communications and meetings with a client once he got the idea that I might not stay with the firm) but they mostly see you as meat. Have a sit down with each joint work partner before you bring business to them and make then agree, in writing, to a set of principles as to how you will work together. Otherwise you will find yourself with a client who thinks of you as bump on a log and you may very well find that your joint work partner has commandeered the relationship which you had to begin with.

They all treated me as a full time advisor and I had the ability to get experience to grow my knowledge in this career and learned how to best serve our clients.

Not so much of cons other than you have to be a highly motivated individual as this is a business that strives off of a entrepreneurial mindset.

Wed Jul 31 2019, Advisor,"Los Angeles, CA",Current Employee ,Rewarding Business,0,"This review is for Northwestern Mutual Los Angeles: DTLA, Irvine, West Los Angeles, Manhattan Beach, and Las Vegas

It is what you make it. If you treat this like a career, work hard, and are disciplined, this opportunity is unlike any other. You help people, meet new people everyday, and can make great money doing it. The culture is great, people care about one another, help each other, and generally have a sense of fellowship. I have made friends here that extend beyond the work place.

Some reviews talk about the focus on insurance. That has not been my experience. The focus is on comprehensive financial planning i.e. working with folks to take a holistic view marrying their future goals with their current actions and guiding them in making adjustments that help them track toward their goals more efficiently and effectively. This often includes things as simple as budgeting or as complicated as tax mitigation strategies. Insurance is often a part of the conversation as part of that plan, but definitely not the focus. This broad approach makes for an exciting work environment because there is almost always a way we can help every single person we meet. 

The flexibility in this career is a blessing and a curse. If you have self-discipline and treat this as a job, it is incredible from the standpoint of allowing you to build in work / live balance. Especially as you mature in the business, the setup of the business is such that you have an incredible amount of freedom of time with residual income guaranteed.
","Again, this career is what you make of it. If you are attracted to the freedom of this career without a balance of self-discipline, it is easy to fall behind and not build a clientele like you need to in the beginning. If you are willing to work hard and diligently, this is not an issue.

","The recruiter role specifically is highly dependent on the office you are in, and the management in that office.

The culture around recruiting and lead generation is highly dependent upon the entire office's culture, including success of the Financial Advisors, and initiative from leadership. Due to the structure of NM and the recruiting practices, your success is very dependent on the circumstances of your specific office.

Either change/advance and become digital or become irrelevant! The company is trying to progress, the current (soon to be former) CTO (Emilia S.) is the BEST thing that has every happened to the IT Department. Emilia is a true leader of the people. She is all about valuing the people that do the actual work and not about corporate nonsense. She came in, during her way to short, tenure and cleaned up the mess that her predecessors had created. She looked to build a culture of engineers and people that could actually get stuff done. She met with people, she built relationships with the engineers and developers, she cut out the waste of useless leadership that was ingrained in their own self fulfilling nonsense. She deeply cared about the people that she knew were doing the work, she had their backs and fought like hell to get them the resources they needed to be successful. This also caused some disruptions of the ""old guard"", may people that were holding on to their old status became toxic and resentful. I suppose that is natural. Overall the IT department advanced light years under her watch as compared to the prior 18 years that I have been there.
","There were some areas created in the IT department as part of the changes that didn't make a whole lot of sense. Some clear antipatterns of a modern IT department like a seperate application support area. I suspect that this was a temporary function that Emilia would have eventually had consolidated.

","You are an insurance salesman in this career, and nothing more. Being called a ""financial representative"" is a lie to mask the fact that these FR's (insurance salesmen) just want to sell unnecessarily high premiums to anybody.

I was lured into this career out of college because I was promised stipends, bonuses, mentorship, and wealth management opportunities. DO NOT BE FOOLED BECAUSE NONE OF THIS WILL HAPPEN. 

Talk to friends and family, and the vast majority of them will have negative opinions (and rightly so) of this company. You will receive two weeks of sales training (virtually no training on product) and that is it. It is ridiculous to think people are expected to sell something to those they are supposed to care about with zero product training. 

Anyone thinking about doing this, just know it is a pyramid scheme. There were only two FR's out of dozens in my office that I actually respected. The rest of them have no friends because nobody likes somebody that just tries to sell insurance 24/7.

You’re groomed by advisors who are veterans to the industry, and know exactly how to start a financial planning practice. With the resources of a Fortune 100, AAA rated company, each intern has the ability to learn anything they wish about the financial planning world. No other investment management firm will have the hands on training that northwestern has, or allow interns to make their own schedule. This internship works for independent, forward thinking individuals who like being with people.

To be successful you need courage, creativity, ambition and grit to become an independent practitioner. I graduated college with dozens of clients, an investment advisor, halfway toward earning my CFP designation, all while maintaining a flexible schedule. It’s a truly unique opportunity, one that will take you to around the country building your business. Everyone who starts this position after college tells me they wish they had done the internship.

I was sold with a promise it would only require 10 calls per day to have a high probability of success (this number became 40 in training). The numbers for likely pay seem equally overpromised. The training process wasn't described appropriately and required more capital investment than explained (like $15 per day personal parking plus the cost of client parking at $5 per hour). The trainer was abusive and the office maintains that environment; I don't remember many days where someone wasn't verbally abused or ostracized when they weren't at the top of their game.
