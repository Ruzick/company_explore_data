Started the day off at 3 am and finished the day at 1100 pm (not kidding) to be back up by 5 am.

Advice to Management
Stop lying to the employee population. From stating publicly there won't be job cuts and then cutting jobs a few days later, to stating there have been no Covid-19 transmissions in HQ building when there have, you have completely lost the trust of your workforce. Forcing employees to take unpaid leaves of absence last summer just to appease the investor community (who didn't even ask about it on the earnings call) and then severely cutting bonuses across the board means employees were forced to do their same jobs over a shorter time period for less pay. This took place despite the company quietly began buying back stock when the share price was well over $200. Working here has become depressing.

","Very toxic environment for both management and agreement employees. There is no job stability with this company. Employees live in constant fear of being laid off/let go with no warning. Cuts are made by executive leadership without input from direct supervisors or teams.

Promotional/Growth opportunities are extremely limited. Upper level management is shuffled from department to department, and they bring their favorites with them.

you can always quit...i think...honestly not sure about that though. They might actually fire you for trying to quit.
","So many to name, 
 - There is absolutely no managerial accountability for anything. (It's out of their hands, they know nothing about it, it's impossible to fix, it's been that way for 20 years, I'll get back to you, or more often than not...well, it's your fault)

 - a new attendance policy has been implemented in which an employee could work for 362 days (being available for call, on duty, or resting) and need to take a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off - and they will be jobless upon their return.

On call 24/7/365 with no set days off

 - are denied earned compensated leave days due to ""manpower shortage"" as the company constantly manipulates staffing to ensure it always has the absolute minimum amount of people available to operate

 - constantly and consistently violates the Collective Bargaining Agreement, which is the contract we work under, forcing employees to work out of proper rest, off of qualified areas, and doing jobs designated to other groups and threaten termination

 - employment termination is constantly threatened by the terms ""Failure to Comply"" and ""Insubordination"" being used at every opportunity to justify a company officer's abuse of power and disregard for employees' safety, rest, quality of life, morale, and overall well being.

 - Never being able to plan anything longer than 2 hours in advance...ever

 - not being able to participate or engage in normal life without constantly checking to see if you are going to get called for work, but even then, due to the complete lack of regard by management, even if you think you can mow your lawn for an hour without checking your phone, chances are they will call you to work and if you don't answer within 30 minutes of their first attempt...you are more than half way to being fired

on average, the normal railroader is awake for 24+ hours at a time. It is normal to be awake for 10-16 hours and then unexpectedly get called for work, in which days can range from 6 to 20 hours on duty. 

You never know when you will be going to work, what kind of job you will be working, how long you will be at work, or if by the time you drive to work that they wont send you home because they made a mistake, just so you can pull in your driveway to have them call you back to work.

There is no direct access to the payroll department

the people that you need to speak with to take time off (should you dare) either don't answer the phone (so you get to spend an hour on hold) or they are typically unpleasant condescending...leading to the next point

Nearly Every part of the management team at the local and regional level are conniving and condescending. 

The union representation is an absolute joke in which yo pay an absurd amount of monthly dues to a local in which your ONLY course of action in the case of an agreement violation is to file a claim - which is then immediately auto - denied by the payroll department, to which you submit a dispute to your union, in which you may see 10% of your claim value in 7 to 10 years...but that depends on if you are buddy buddy with a union official. if not...well sorry about your luck

The overall atmosphere at the railroad is similar to high school. Most of your co workers will spread gossip and misinformation based on what they heard someone else say they heard from a guy who was talking to someone that heard about a situation that somebody else heard about.

most people are more concerned with what everyone else is doing than minding their own business, and someone always has something to say about how they think you aren't doing what they think you should be doing.


The only thing Union Pacific truly cares about is that you are available to answer the phone and show up to work your train. Not Health, not safety, not its employees, not veterans, not family. All of that is marketing and for the shareholders.

","The company is always looking to cut headcount; your job is never safe. The cuts are so drastic that the workforce is very limited and works with limited resources. This is a very challenging culture - you get advanced if you’re in the “circle,” but if you’re not, getting recognized and promoted is rare. The company says they value diversity and equity, but their actions don’t support that proposition. I would never recommend this company to any prospective employee. The benefits for new employees aren’t enough to overcome the poor pay and terrible culture.

","Shareholders and operating ratio first, safety last. The precision railroading model is a joke. It’s just a numbers manipulation game so the shareholders and Fritz make more money. Constantly trying to find a way to eliminate workforce to drive the operating ratio down so yet again, Fritz and the shareholders make more money. You don’t get any scheduled days off and the attendance policy they forced down our throats basically lets you take one sick day a month. If you exceed one day off a month, they terminate you. The unions have no power and the company does whatever they please with no regard to agreements. You’re just a replaceable number on a seniority roster. Hands down the worst company I have ever worked for.

Pros
*Salary is competitive
*Flexible for vacation/time off
*Able to work from home one day/week extended to every day through Covid
Cons
*Embrace of PSR has left employees, customers, and communities to suffer
*Eliminated pension for new employees after 2018
*Difficult to advance during PSR/Unified Plan 2020 as departments consolidate. I applied for 3 jobs in the past 2 years and they were all cancelled/combined with other jobs.
*Closed entire 40 person department with one-day notice. Severance packages were decent, but it would have been nice to give their employees more of a heads-up.
Advice to Management
Everything is so focused on the 55% operating ratio that successful service offerings are eliminated if they ""cost too much."" Company would rather see the business go away than work for it. Weak service means that shippers are not using rail and fewer trains/crews are needed, which means lower costs! They don't care about future prospects for customers/earnings when they can just reduce the operating ratio and get short-term gains. Unified Plan 2020 is going to need some serious unraveling after they hit the 55% operating ratio, if they can even make it. Once bulk commodities coal and frac sand are totally gone, they're going to need to scramble to find new customers-- the same ones they chased away in an effort to reduce costs!

Many have criticized the senior leaders of the company but my perspective having worked at all levels of this organization is those criticizing lack an understanding of the market fundamentals that are forcing the company to change. While many prefer a status quo model, that is a going out of business strategy and our longevity for the past 150+ years is because we have learned to adapt to the different market swings. I love the people I work with every day. Railroaders are passionate about solving problems, building america, connecting businesses and the economy. I love going to work every day as our business provides significant value to communities, customer, employees, and investors that rely on our services. I love that we touch nearly every industry, from the food on your table, walls of your house, to the cars that you drive, to the buildings that you work in....we transport all of it. Without us, roads would be more congested than they are already. Businesses would close their doors as transportation costs made it impossible to compete. I'm proud to be a railroader of the Union Pacific.
","Recent changes in our business have forced the company to reduce the number of jobs which is hard for all of us but I am confident we will grow again as the economy changes and as we adapt to the evolving market conditions.

Think about the negative language, gossip, and body language you protrude onto others. And then think, would you want someone doing that to you and treating you that way? Honestly though, think about that question for one minute and if you answer ""No I wouldn't want to be treated that way"", then you have an opportunity to make a positive change in how you treat others.

We are all human beings. No one person is better than another. Period. There is nothing wrong with confidence, but you could start to create unwelcomed friction if abrasive arrogance takes over.

In reality, the people complaining on here are the union people. You can never please them. I (non union) worked at HDQ, loved it. I didn't leave the company because I wanted to, I had to due to other circumstances otherwise I would have stayed. The unhappy non union people are those who want beer at their desks and put put golf in the cafeteria, things start up companies do to compensate for lower pay. This is a 150yr + company, a little more mature than drinking on the job.

Paychecks always clear, though you never get paid what you should be by agreement.

I was happily able to leave on my own terms, so there's that!
","You are quiet literally just a number in a system, and a warm body to fill a slot. You will be treated as an easily replaceable commodity, so be aware! You WILL be on call 24/7/365, and woe unto you if you anger the people in charge of the attendance policy in Omaha, even with their arbitrary enforcement of their made-on-the-fly rules. Have a spouse and/or kids? Hope you don't really like them as much as you say, because you'll never see them and watch them grow up. You're going to miss out on a lot of important events in their lives, because ""Uncle Pete"" now controls yours. Hope you like nasty Chinese food in a seedy hotel on Christmas! 

All that is if you are actually able to work and not be furloughed every year since your hire date, and currently people with 8-9 years seniority are on the bubble.

Like other reviews, this company will only hire you for a tax break, and will take every single chance it can get to fire you. It's the only job I've ever heard of where you have to get ""fire insurance"" in case you temporarily lose you job, or worse! 

The safety culture has really gone downhill since I hired on. At the very least, it was a facade of ""Safety First"" back then. But with the recent and on going changes safety is now blatantly in third place, behind the shareholders and profits respectively. The injury rate rise and also with five fatalities in the past year really shows how UP cares about their workers.

This is definitely a place where only those extremely desperate for a job should go, only IF you have exhausted all other options.

Fri Oct 11 2019, Manager of Yard Operations,,Former Employee ,UP needs to improve their culture if they want to succeed,12,"Great Pay (and I suppose opportunity to move up seeing as a lot of people are leaving/getting laid off/""involuntarily separated)
","I was excited when I first joined up. Great OMT Program that psuedo-prepares you for management. Class said that if you were to have challenges, it would most likely be with the ""Agreement Professionals"" aka the union guys, but I guess I got lucky. All of my guys were amazing, and taught me more than management ever did (besides how to record/brief metrics). It's blatantly obvious that upper management really doesn't care about it's employees; I mean, read the other reviews. The company preaches work-life balance, but if you want to stand out and be good at your job (or perceived to be) you have to pull long hours, especially at when you're not at a big terminal and it's just you out there.
Since I left there have been 2 (maybe 3?) rounds of layoffs. All to maximize shareholder value. It's such a shame because they preach safety, but then reduce the amount of the workforce, Agree and Salary (like management) alike and expect safer, more efficient work ethic. I just don't see that happening... Overall, I learned a lot from UP in the short time I was there ( only 16 months), but I'm glad that I left. Think twice before applying, especially if you have a family.

Sat Sep 28 2019, Conductor,"Fort Worth, TX",Current Employee ,Completely Ridiculous!!,11,"Its probably the best pay you can get without any training or a degree. You dont pay into social security anymore. You get railroad retirement (which is better than social security), a really good benefits package, and the option for a 401k after your first year of service.
","Here we go...…

This job is ALL about seniority and without it, you are nothing! This means that even though you are the best worker with the best attendance you will still lose your job to a lazy jackwad with more seniority than you. This means that nobody has an incentive to go out and do a great job because it doesn't matter.

When you are a lower seniority employee you will most likely only be able to hold the jobs that nobody else wants. This will most likely mean you're on an ""extraboard"". Your work/life balance will be heavily one-sided towards work. You WILL miss all the holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, parties, etc! Unless you are on Federal Rest (FR) or Undisturbed Rest (UR) you will be on-call and live every minute by your phone. There will be days that you sit at home all day thinking you're going to work, and you dont.....Then there will be times when it looks like you'll have the whole day off, then get called right when you get to the lake. It is extremely hard to get a good amount of actual rest before getting on a train. 

Furloughs are a real thing! Unless you have a minimum of 5 years of service dont even think about buying anything big, like a house, boat, or expensive truck. You can be balls-to-the-wall busy for 2 years straight then all of a sudden and without notice you're cut off. 

This company only has one goal, and thats to make the shareholders as much money as possible. Union Pacific breaks revenue records every quarter and always makes more money than the previous year but that will not stop them from cutting jobs and overtime wherever they can. The employees are the biggest liability and the less there are of you the less the liability. They dont care how many kids you have, how many car payments you have or about the mortgage you have to pay. If cutting hundreds of people will make the shareholders money then thats what they will do. 

Union Pacific will fight you on every pay claim you try and submit. Their first action is to always deny your claim, then hope you dont come back and fight it. They also dont adhere you union agreements. If you are a new conductor they will call you and have you work a job that is outside of what you're supposed to be doing, then threaten you with a refusal to work if you dont accept it. However, its a lot harder for them to get away with this with the seasoned guys that know the agreements. 

You will be away from home a lot! I spent my first 9 months in a different state then I applied in. This goes to my first point about seniority. If people with higher seniority are working where your ""home"" is and no jobs are available there then you have to find somewhere else to work. Your only hope is for the company to add jobs in your home area or you can pray that the people with higher seniority either retire or move somewhere else.

I dont have anything negative to say about my local managers. They do the best they can with what the company gives them and they are fair (This is not the case everywhere).

If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients."" This is a quote that I wholeheartedly agree with. How much money do you have to make before you are happy? What number do you have to reach in order for you to keep your people working and putting food on their tables? When you are all sitting in that board meeting, perhaps the topic should be how you're going to keep people working.....instead of how many you have to cut to keep your coffers full.

Local management is fine for the most part. Overarching management from up top is very knee-jerk reacting which disrupts workers ability to be efficient and to remain motivated. They'd rather run things as skeleton crew as possible and work employees to the point of burnout. My advice would be talking to your guys on the ground to see how things are actually running rather than the numbers that are being fudged in the office.

This company is a joke of a company. ALL railroads are looking to do away with the conductor slot on freight trains and eventually the engineer behind them. They will get their way because they are backed by wall street and government entities. Everyone always talks about the railroad being a good job and how their grandpa or whoever retired from there. Yes at one time it WAS a good job and they moved freight and paid well but now? its all about revenue and shareholder profit for the real owners of UP with Lance Fritz right there with them.

Too many programs have been tried without addressing the root cause of issues faced by labor. Management turn over has gone from bad to worse with each successive change becoming a new nightmare. Utilizing employees creativity in finding solutions has completely stopped and innovation is stifled. Too many protections for problem employees (often with higher seniority) have led to significant losses of skilled trade knowledge.

Consider profit sharing for certain departments to instill pride in one's work quality and performance. Stop putting recent college graduates with no practical experience into management roles. Value the younger more physically able and mentally sharp employees instead of laying them off; you can begin to achieve that by allowing for earlier retirement once a minimum years of service is reached. Don't stifle creativity; we know the job and the tools best so pay attention to organic innovation. You can't increase shareholder value by laying off shareholders (employees).

Benefits: The worst health insurance I have ever had. Fortune 200 company and this is what you negotiated for us? A single person $5800 deductible and the 80/20. The physicians list is terrible and the cost alone for the insurance is a slap in the face.

None. And they took away the pension for new hires so don't be fooled.
Cons
Frequent Layoffs, High-Talent Exodus, Zero Room for Growth, values seniority over performance, the same people telling you it'll be OK are the same people looking for the door. And if they are not looking for the door then the UP will 'compassionately' kick you to the curb. Look Elsewhere. Low Morale. I could go on and on.

","The instability- constant layoffs are hard for family budget. In addition, the schedule of being constantly available is more stress than the money is worth. This instability will only be aggravated in the future because of the regulatory environment allowing one person crews once the Union contracts allow for it.

","Lack of empathy for employees, stuck in the same old same old mentality. The railroad isn’t a place to raise a family. Matter of fact they don’t care about your family. They don’t care about there employees. All they care about is the shareholders. They want to cut jobs at the sake of safety. This last year there have been more fatalities, injuries, broken rail, derailments, collisions, and job cuts. They don’t care about anyone unless they have a large amount invested in there stocks. It’s actually sad to see the route they are going. And to those investing in this company and there poor business ethics. Shame on you. They are taking you for s ride, the business is going down hill and fast. Don’t be surprised when insider trading is talked about in 12-15 months. They’re gonna steal your money!

But, it paid OK and the beneifts worked well. If possible once you hit 100k pick a small terminal where you can get to know people. Be firm but most of all, BE FAIR.

Sat Jun 29 2019, Terminal Manager,,Current Employee ,We Have Lost too Many Good Employees; Culture is Ruined,12,"1) Healthy pay for field managers. Salary + stock/bonus for high performers. I was marked in 2018 as a high performer and was paid very nicely for my time sacrifice. 
2) Promotional opportunity ever 1-3 years
","Cons of Working in Field Operations:

1) Poor work life balance. Field managers work 90+ hours on road territories and are on call 24 hours of each work day. Terminal managers work 55-70 hours per week however they are fighting fires every minute of it. Its not just the hours that create the poor work life balance, it’s the stress. When you get home you are so on edge about your operation you can’t unwind. 
2) Culture: this is the biggest con by far. The company expects you as a manager to be a authoritarian dictator. I have a collaborative leadership style which is quite opposite of the authoritarian. I tried to lead my way and eventually you have no choice but to play their game and lead their way... otherwise the other managers who do lead their way will shine well above you and you will earn a target on your back. Their style over the years has instilled a negative mindset into every agreement professional’s head and had burned out a lot of good managers. 
3) Cost Cutting: Union Pacific is implementing precision schedule railroading which is effectively a major cost cutting effort. I believe PSR is good in a lot of respects. Everyone knows there is opportunity for our company to be more efficient with its money. Unfortunately we have cut too deep in key resources such as locomotives. I have trains I can move right now as I type this review and am unable to do so because I have no locomotives to pull the cars.
Advice to Management
I will start by prefacing that I have been identified by Sr. Management as a ‘high performer’ on the succession plan list. Despite this, I am looking for a new career. These are my thoughts: Jim Young (Former CEO and sadly deceased) often said that employees are the greatest resource of the Union Pacific Railroad. He made employees feel valued. He wasn’t perfect, however he was making strides in a company that is very ancient in its practices and policies. When Lance took over in 2015, nearly every action he took removed Jim’s hard work. We have since had layoffs in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In addition, countless employees have taken early retirements or resigned to find a better career. I alone in my 5-10 years with the company have known 100 people that left, many of whom were high performers. The company can always buy new track, locomotives or other fixed assets. We will never gain back the talent we have lost. I went from loving the company to now searching for a new career. When I walk through headquarters, I look around and hardly recognize the place I work for. Every employee is in survival mode and is working in fear to protect their job. Below are some of my recommendations however I think Sr. Management likes things just the way they are. 
My recommendation to Sr. Mgmt: Be open and honest about what you are trying to do. Quit with the UP Pride b/s. Your employees see right through it. It’s pretty much propaganda, no better than North Korean media. If you don’t care about us and expect us to work our butts off purely for a paycheck than say that. At first I didn’t like Vena but now I respect his transparency. He at least tells us to expect more workforce reductions. If this isn’t the environment you want, then you will need to oust Lance and bring back a leader people can rally to. Also, give us the resources we need. I am figgin tired of not having enough locomotives to run my trains and when I call the shop they say they don’t have enough personnel to fix the broken units. Anyway... I have trains to move. I’m going to start ranting and I don’t have all day and night to write this review.

","Expect to work shifts/jobs that you don't enjoy for the first 2 -5 years or more, depending on seniority. Many layoffs and cutting other essential resources in order to save money. Expect to pay dues to a Union every month that honestly doesn't do as much as we would all hope. Technology is growing exponentially on the tracks and my educated guess is that it won't be long until UP moves from 2 man crews-->1 man crews-->Trains operating themselves. Unfortunately, when it comes to managers and crews, there isn't much collaboration but rather confrontation and resistance. Front-line managers are usually great to work with but their superiors put a lot of pressure on them to make the impossible happen which is likely due to not really being exposed to the fine details of the actual operation.
Advice to Management
UP absolutely needs to give their employees some INCENTIVE if they want them to perform at the levels they are capable of. These men and women on the ground are smart and creative and will really surprise you when they're at their most productive. The problem is that there is no INCENTIVE to 1.) get there faster 2.)switch more cars 3.) go above and beyond 4.) be flexible and perform other duties. When all of us first interviewed for a job, we promised that we would work hard and do our best, but years of distrust and seeing others get fired for breaking a rule (there are a lot of rules, there's one for everything you do on the property), most of us would rather play it safe than help out the RR. It wouldn't take much to apply some INCENTIVE to the employees. Bonuses for high productivity, bringing ""quits"" back, recognition for consistently showing up to work, paying higher trip rates for thru-freight instead of promising overtime after 8 hours, giving the crews more independence when it comes to making decisions, and certainly stopping the incentive's for managers to find the most minor FTX ""failures"" on their crews; the list goes on... In today's railroad you don't get paid more for being a better employee, you don't get to go home early after your work is done, all you do is risk your job and your family's financial security. There is a saying that I hear often on the railroad, ""The more you do.... the more you do.""

Also, keep MYO's and S/MTO's in one location longer than a year or 2. It seems that once a manager really starts to get knowledgeable about the operation, they are shipped off to another state and replaced by someone who has to spend a lot of time building trust with the crews.

Sun Jun 23 2019, Senior Analyst,"Omaha, NE",Former Employee ,"Underutilized, Undervalued, Unappreciated",5,"Looks good on a resume.
","Where to begin? 

1. Zero work/life balance. If you are a manager in department that operates 24/7/365, you are expected to be on call 24/7/365. This means you are subject to being called in to cover someone else’s shift if they call in, with barely any notice. You are also “encouraged” to have your email set up on your personal phone so you don’t miss anything when you’re not in the office. You’re also bothered when on vacation and are never really “away”. Many times, I’d work 60-70+ hours each week and still had to be on-call regardless. 
2. Long hours. The ones in the “glass palace” work a modest 8-5 with a lunch break and have time to go to the on-site gym. The ones at the Harriman work a minimum of 10-hour days with no lunch (they can’t tell you that you CAN’T take a lunch, but it’s frowned upon to leave and get something to eat. Most just eat at their desks).
3. The HDC also does not have a gym on-site for employees to use. It’s a mile and a half from the UP HQ building, so it would be impossible to get a workout in over lunch. 
4. Incompetent management and nepotism runs rampant. People are promoted based upon their popularity rather than their skill level, tenure, and knowledge of the railroad. 
5. Management and directors will block people from interviewing for promotions because they’re worried about losing good employees. 
6. Management and directors will also hold employees for MONTHS until a replacement is hired. Oftentimes, the new department rescinds their offer because they can’t get the employee in time, leading to the employee not getting a promotion they rightfully earned. 
7. Unrealistic expectations set forth by management.
8. Attitude from subordinates that are never addressed by senior leadership, which leads to a negative work environment. Everyone is constantly walking on eggshells as to not say something that may get them subject to an EEO investigation. 
9. Participation in work-related groups and events is discouraged by managers, even though they want us to be involved in activities per our TPT/performance review. Lose/lose situation here.
10. CONSTANT layoffs. There have been a round of layoffs every single year I was here, with more coming. The executives don’t understand the bigger picture. All they care about is padding their wallets. In turn, these constant layoffs create added stress on the employees that were left, because they have to pick up the work that their peers used to do on top of their own.
Advice to Management
STOP WITH THE LAYOFFS. It is doing you NO good. You’re losing so many valuable employees that have given their blood, sweat, and tears to the company and that is how you repay them. You hired a new COO who was there to make sure PSR got off the ground, paying him MILLIONS in the process, while laying off hundreds of employees. Save yourselves the money and cut back on all these executives’ and board members’ salaries and keep the employees you need.

","I've been putting off my review because I didn't know where to begin. It's been over a year since I left and I still get upset when I think deeply about my time with UP.

Well first off I have to say the culture was terrible. Nobody seemed to care about anything, much less completing the minimum assigned tasks. When work was performed it would be only what was explicitly assigned. Nobody owned their work or took pride in what they did.

The unions and management have a terrible relationship. I often felt like I was caught in between 2 divorced parents when dealing with the two, and in the end I resented both of them for it.

When I would insist on doing my job correctly and tried to favor long term solutions over short term fixes management would likely be upset, or indifferent at a minimum. For example: One of my coworkers at my current job quit working at UP after only a few weeks after getting into an argument with a foreman where the foreman was upset the he had done his job correctly and in accordance with federal, and company standards.

For a time I helped install PTC equipment on locomotives. This was a task the company grudgingly completed and it showed. After failing to meet deadline after deadline the company would complain to congress about how difficult it was and how hard they were trying. This got them yet another extension. The company then turned around and laid-off over 50% of the installers. 

My problem wasn't with the work. I actually enjoyed what I did, but every day felt like an ethical compromise. 

The company simply doesn't care about job performance or customer satisfaction. Shortly after they rolled out their arrogant G55+0 plans a few of us began crafting our own GTFO90+0 plans and made sure we weren't stuck on the last chopper out of Saigon. I have no regrets.

","Union Pacific has floundered under current 'leadership'. They can no longer sustain a positive workforce due to unending cuts to workforce, budgets, and benefits. My role was underappreciated and underpaid (salary / bonus / raise). I lacked the tools I continuously requested as a requirement to do my job effectively due to 'budget'. I know for a fact that many people in my previous department received bonuses and retention stock DOUBLE my annual salary, yet I was unable to get training or new supplies to complete my daily tasks. And my raises and bonuses were a slap in the face. Certain people snagged interviews for jobs they might not even be qualified for as ""favors""...sometimes those individuals received those promotions. It's all who you know, who you're related to, and who 'owes you one'... If you speak up regarding ANYTHING shady or suspect, your claims / issues are buried and forgotten. The offenders are protected and shielded from any repercussions and you will be told that their supervisor will handle redirect privately and internally. This never ends up happening. The employee engagement surveys continue to come back worse and worse. They have made little to no change regarding this feedback. They are moving backwards. Even their steps forwards (paid parental leave for fathers) is pathetic and antiquated. Other companies are beginning to offer unlimited vacation packages, paid parking downtown, significant paid family leave packages that include maternity leave for mothers and fathers...Union Pacific is failing. And with each cut to their workforce, they are committing to more and more failure. I fear for those on the ground operating the trains and doing the real work. Someone is going to be pushed too far, too hard for too long and end up injured or worse...

Also, there's a great training program for new IT workers, and an energized culture for improving and augmenting the railroad's tech stack.
","- Like a lot of other Fortune 500 firms, UP currently has a single-minded dedication to ticking off all the cynical late-stage capitalism stereotypes they can. Layoffs, pay cuts, benefit cuts in the face of record profits and corporate tax cuts, all for the sake of improving the all-holy operating ratio number.
- The ""Unified Plan 2020"" that was recently announced will make things very, very interesting over the next few years.
- Going along with the above two, the retirement plan is pretty useless if hanging around for a long career is increasingly rare.
- Location in Omaha, NE has hurt recruitment and leads to a glut of new employees from the same universities. The culture of suburban Nebraska has caused problems for minority and LGBT employees (though, to their credit, UP does seem to do as much as they can to mitigate this)
- Some teams in IT struggle with integrating all developers/workers into the team in a meaningful manner. This goes quadruple for high-priority projects; UP does not have the people capable of managing and architecting these projects, generally won't go out and find them, and won't listen to them when they do get them.

Greed is the only thing driving the cuts. UP is now focusing on executing the precision railroading playbook. It feels like the shareholders are the only constituents at the moment. UP is no longer investing in its employees or employee engagement. If you are not directly related to current revenues, chances are your job will be cut. Future strategy is a thing of the past.

Tue Oct 30 2018," Project Engineer, Structures Design","Omaha, NE",Former Employee ,"Professional Engineers, Structural Engineers, Beware!",14,"- Given the cons, none really. When the company is so screwed up, flexible hours and a company gym don't really matter.

- They pay you a lot, but then fire you. I'd rather be paid less and keep my job.
","- Mass layoffs in 2018 following mass layoffs in 2016 and others before that, including a layoff in 2002.

- Miniscule to non-existent design group, whether in track, signal, or structural design. As an idea, only about 6 engineers handle all the track and terminal design for a 32,000 mile track network. They can barely shuffle the paperwork to get the consultants paid...which is all they have time to do.

- CEO and COO are heartless, ignorant, and short-sighted copy cats of Hunter Harrison. Operating ratio is only metric they care about, and even though it is already in the 60s...which is already unsustainable and unrealistic...they have gutted what was left of the actual engineers that the company employs to lower it.

- Essentially no real engineering at UP, stay away if you are a PE who wants to combine field work and design experience. All they want are engineers to join their OMT program out of college and manage unionized workers. This makes no sense, because these folks are out of college and add little value to the field compared to an ex-union manager...nor do they have any jobs left in the office to develop their hard engineering skills and plow those skills back into the field.

- If you weren't good at engineering or don't particularly like it, and want to do long hours of managing workers and projects, with a consultant providing all the actual engineering, join UP. You won't have a life, you'll hardly have vacations, you won't learn much engineering, and some day, UP will fire you when the Operating Ratio is too high.

- Again, remember, they are firing people after several previous waves of layoffs, and gutted what was an already bare bones organization in a time of traffic congestion and service issues. How much worse can it get?
Advice to Management
- UPRR should be sued by the federal government and not allowed to paint an American flag, or use the slogan ""Building America"". The CEO and COO are the incarnation of 21st century American corporate greed and stupidity. Oh, and UPRR is incorporated in Delaware...they ask employees for local donations while paying taxes to a state in which they have no train tracks so they can make more money.

- C-suite, you have golden parachutes and are multi-millionaires, so you could destroy an American icon and it really makes no difference to your lives. Plus you won't read this, and even if you do, you'll disagree. My only purpose here is to alert your share holders that you put above your employees and customers...and of course, the American public, who gave you the land that you built your tracks on 150 years ago comes dead last. After all, you fired all the men and women who served as the field liaisons between the railroad and local governments in this last employee demolition derby.

- Operating ratio does not take into account capital costs. Railroads are one of the most, if not the most capital intensive business out there. Employees were fired to lower the OR, which will balloon capital costs as more work is contracted out. Service issues will go from a problem to a disaster since you gutted what was left of the intellectual leadership in Omaha. Don't invest in UP or the company it copied, CSX.

The opportunity to become a manager right out of college is rare and unheard of for most companies. In the OMT program you are given the opportunity to learn from many different craft and managers to gain new skills. This a fantastic chance to start a career but after going through the program some things should be noted to all who are seeking this position.
","When the position says you will be working 24/7/365 days a year it literally translates to holidays don’t exist and trying to get vacation for these days might not be possible because only so many managers can be off at a time. In mechanical you may work an 8-10 hour day but it usually means working 12-13 hours if you are covering for somebody else because they are on vacation which is very frequent at this time. The current schedule is a 5/2 or an 11/3. Yes, this could mean 11 days in a row working over 12 hours a day. Transportation works this frequently. Transportation usually runs a 12-13 hour a day. Many more hours than other companies. 
Vacation is now 3 weeks for starting out (similar to many companies now) but with no holidays unless they randomly fall on your rest days you are pretty much missing 11 paid days off. Almost two weeks short of what other companies are paying. Being non-agreement means that when you work on a holiday you won’t be paid more and if fact you are most likely to work even longer on a holiday to make up for the other manager who requested the time off. 
In most companies where you have to work shift work you get paid more for weekends, nights, or holidays but you will find no fairness here. In fact currently, facilities are running schedules that all managers don’t get a full weekend. For example, if you work 1st shift you may have two weekdays for your off days. If you work 2nd shift your off days could be Friday and Saturday. Some locations have a 6-month rotation. Some don’t mind this schedule but if you are religious or desire to do things on the weekend you won’t be able to possibly attend these activities for 6 months. 
Sick days only pertain to you so if your spouse is in the hospital plan on taking vacation time or unpaid time off. 
Heavy regulation on rules so much that the workers fear of even doing work. FTX program (coaching people on rules) has great intentions but has caused a great disgruntlement in the company. The company has made policy changes and working situations which overall makes unhappy workers which makes it hard to manage people.
Advice to Management
Overall, Union Pacific is a great company but has the opportunity to make some changes which I believe would change the outlook on the company. I believe that a person that just complains but doesn’t give solutions is not worth listening to so here would be my advice for the company. 
Time with family is the most crucial key element of the happiness of a worker. UP must stay open 24/7/365 a year but if managers are required to work Thanksgiving they can have Christmas off. Doing a holiday pod similar to the medical field or emergency response teams would be ideal. Setting up schedules that allow people to work the nights, weekends, and holidays and be paid more will allow other people who rather have that time off to be with family or in many cases one parent is allowed to work nights while the other works days. UP needs a company to come in and fix the work-life balance or they will find managers leaving faster than they can hire.

They have eliminated incentive and advancement opportunities to near zero. They don't offer the mso's apprenticeships or ability to advance. As a craft person there is no incentive to learn or try to excel in your craft. Supervision is a joke. Local management is quickly losing interest because they are just puppets. They are taking 30 plus year managers and now making them switch shifts and rest days periodically (some 30 year managers now have Tuesday Wednesday off night shift). Classroom training is being replaced with computer based training which is very unproductive and unengaging.

","A quality work-life balance requires....work. The jobs in the field are grueling. Be prepared to work long hours. Biggest advice to employees is don't take your work home with you. Be present with your family. There are times when you have to answer that call at home, but do your best to be present with those who matter.
Advice to Management
Hire more employees. The biggest reason turnover is so high with employees (especially field managers) is that their workload and responsibilities are enormous. Just because one person can do a job, doesn't mean that is the most cost effective way to go about it. If you split that job between two people, you get a more thorough effort since the burden is shared, as opposed to one person completing it as fast as they can merely to get it off their plate for the next inevitable issue they will face.
 
By sharing the responsibilities among more people, you allow employees time to hone their skills and keep their minds working effectively, rather than exhaustedly. 

A good area to run an experiment is to find where the most people quit, and add EXTRA people to it. From there, you can watch their productivity and compare the historical data to your new data and measure how the employees respond to the change in categories that range from things like their personal wellbeing, to the terminals key measures. 

If all you do is keep re-filling positions as employees quit, there is really no change being made at all. To expect different results in the long run is irrational. ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.""

I know the efforts are in the process through the organizational restructuring, but the sooner the better.

If all you do is keep re-filling positions as employees quit, there is really no change being made at all. To expect different results in the long run is irrational. ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.""

I know the efforts are in the process through the organizational restructuring, but the sooner the better.

","Work rules are stacked against you and you’re pretty much set up to get fired every day you clock in. They’ve taken it a step further by using drones to spy on you when you’re working out in the yards. 

Like doing a good job, and have pride in your work? Good, management will take advantage of that, and run you in to the ground. Find a problem outlined by the companies written standard work that could cause a locomotive to fail pulling a train? Dearly noted, but if your manager is one of the few that’s still employed that has worked their way up, they’re probably gonna tell you “I used to be a (mechanic/electrician) I’m sure that’s not gonna be a problem.” The kids fresh out of college that have a degree in religion, and can’t hold a wrench right will just ask “will it make a trip?”

Like doing the bare minimum, playing stupid, have no ambition to learn your job? This is a great place for you, because the few that are decent will be forced to pick up your slack, so go ahead, burn up that battery on your cell phone, management will run your union brothers in to the ground to pick up your slack. 

The pay is considerably less then the national average now, specially after this last contract that was a underhanded deal to “pass”. 

Safety is only relevant if it doesn’t hold up production. (That’s thanks to the shareholder driven CEO that’s out of touch with the boots on the ground people.) But get caught slipping up when there isn’t a crunch for that particular locomotive you’re working on, then they’re trying to fire you.

There’s no initiative to go above and beyond as well as work safe. Shareholders and operating ratios are more important then making employees feel valued/appreciated.

No weekends off, forced to work holidays, and you can expect be on second or third shift for the first few years.

STOP TREATING YOUR EMPLOYEES LIKE TRASH!!! There’s a reason why the company has to offer 15 and 20k sign on bonuses to get people to come to work for them. The word is finally getting out that this is a garbage company to work for, and I’m glad. I’ve seen this company royally screw good employees over, and ruin lifes.

Yes the company comeback to that would be “well your unions negotiate your wages, blah blah blah...” BUT we get to see what our unions propose. The company just says nope. Even after 10 years of record profits, and the trump tax breaks. 

I have 13 years in, and just like many 8+ year employees we’ve seen the steady decline. Moral is the worst I’ve seen, as well as it’s just flat out hostel.

But I’m good at what I do, and they need me so I’m not that lucky I guess. (Reread second paragraph in cons) 

Bring back employee perks/incentives. Hats and coffee mugs are a slap in the face when all we’ve heard for the last 10 years is “RECORD PROFITS!!!” We show up to work for MONEY not coffee mugs. Bring back safety days!!!! Maybe give some stock, or profit sharing. But whatever, make sure it’s MEANINGFUL. A $25 Walmart gift card is also a slap in the face.

My advice to board is clean up the top of this company. Senior leadership needs to immediately be replaced to stop the hemorrhaging of talented leaders and workers (which btw we have to hire whoever meets the minimum qualification because word is out how this organization is ran). 
Another word to the board, the only way this organization changes is if the press finds out about something we do, or there is a failure that causes loss of life, or injury. Then and only then do we address the issue… usually by creating a rule that does not address the true issues such as rushed employees even though we have to hammer in them that safety is key… we also hammer in them that our cost per car has to remain lower than it is otherwise everyone looses their jobs. Its hard to retain good employees because every 6 years or so we let them go as business slows…. Because we don’t care about the little industries and thus are at the mercy of national business, closely tied with the national economy/politics. 
I have too many years invested in this company to leave, but you have the chance to give our organization the edge by getting new leadership with fresh ideas about innovation and labor relations. It wears on all of my peers as we are constantly told to “find failures” and document them or else we are blackballed in phone calls by senior leadership, threatened politely via email. So many bad or ended marriages in management due to work hours, stress, constant calls while we are at home. Its not found in other organizations.

Trust me, after working at UP for about 6 months, you'll be willing to pay 50k to get out of that toxic environment.
This job will destroy your sanity, health and lifestyle and no amount of money is worth that to me.
When you see the overwhelming amount of negative reviews from conductors that should tell you something.
I have friends that still work for UP and now they watch you with drones??? Unbelievable!!!

","Senior Leadership. Cuts, cuts, cuts. Command by fear used to be the only real issue, now leadership has added demoralization by title reduction and workload increase through staff cuts. The departments that do the least work came out on top while Operations continues to take the brunt of the abuse. Morale is so low and the workloads so immense, that service has declined severely and continues to do so.
MRV's are dropping $5,000 - $50,000 due to the title changes. The thankless jobs used to be well compensated, but the current structure is driving the best people away from those jobs and into positions that have better hours of service and time off.
Advice to Management
Clean house. Replace Senior Leadership with only leaders that have worked their way up from within the company. It's obvious our current CEO does not know which departments drive the rise and fall of service and therefore the company as a whole. He does not understand transportation, nor customer service.
Reset title levels to what they were. MRV's are going to drive away the best of us if not fixed soon. Stop acting like Sales is the most important department. Selling a great product and great service is easy. Our current service is about to make those folks finally earn some of their over-inflated salaries.
Remember, you may be able to CUT to 55 and drive up the stock price, but service will continue to suffer as it has. Stock results cannot be sustained if customer satisfaction and rail service continue to deteriorate. 
When the STB is sending class 1's letters about poor service, wake up and realize you've made a big mistake that needs to be rectified asap.

Fri Feb 16 2018, Conductor/Engineer/RCO Operator,,Current Employee ,No place to work of you have a family or need stable income. Furloughed for majority of first 5-7 years.,1,"Pay and insurance is better than most, but you will sacrifice all family/social events or anything that requires you to be anywhere at a set day or time, ie: childrens games, clubs, leagues, birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, graduations.
","Rampant cronyism and favoritism as far as jobs/trains and dispatching are concerned.

The same employees get the gravy jobs while everyone else works on their rest with no time at home and rot on trains for 12 hours or more most days.

On call 24/7/365 with no set schedule or days off.

Management lies about you to write you up to make discipline quotas and have absolutely no regard for you or your families livelihood.

You will work most weekends and holidays unless you layoff sick and become subject to an attendance investigation under an attendance policy that only states that you are expected to work full time and protect your assignment.

The reason for not giving actual guidelines for attendance is that they are afraid people would follow them.

Full retirement isn't until age 65-67 after 30 years of service so if you are older full retirement isn't an option unless you work into your late 60's or 70's.

Also, railroad life of working on call with no set schedule is very unhealthy and proof of that is that the average retiree only draws 18 months of retirement before they die.

If you are considering working for Union Pacific know that you will be furloughed constantly and that their current junior employees have been furloughed for the majority of the last 5 years.

So unless you have another source of income, do not even consider Union Pacific because you will be furloughed and your job will be threatened everyday by managements interpretation of rules and your performance.

Everything is a critical rules violation including turning your head for a second to double check a switch or derail.

Seriously, even if you look back while riding equipment out past a switch, if you look back for a split second, to see if the switch lined, that's one strike out of 3 towards permanent dismissal.

No matter what they promise you do not take a job with Union Pacific unless you have nothing else or can live without steady income for years and have no other options.

All of the reviews on here and indeed about management being dishonest and attempting to terminate you on a daily basis is absolutely true and cronyism and favoritism is rampant regardless of how much, or how good of a worker you are.

If you are not a Facebook friend and regularly suck up you will work all the worst trains and spend twice the time on trains and out of town as the suckups do and there are only a small amount of good jobs and the same people work them all the time while everyone else works twice as much for the same money.

If I had to do it all over again knowing what I know now, I wouldn't of even considered it.

Be forewarned because if you are older like I am, it will waste your prime working years and leave you trapped seriously limiting your options.

If you are under 40, consider going back to school or taking a job that pays less with a regular set schedule.

On call 24/7/365 will take its toll on you and your family and relationships fast.

After the second year your friends and family won't even call you anymore about events and gatherings because you will be working, sleeping, or rotting on a train staring at a red signal for several hours waiting to yard your train.

Wed Oct 25 2017,Anonymous,"Omaha, NE",Current Employee ,Change afoot - weigh the pros and cons,20,"Great benefits and salary. The expectations are high. Work/life balance is preached but generally not supported. Most employees feel pressured to work many extra hours due to the 24/7 nature of the work. It's not for everyone but there are many opportunities if you are willing and able to work hard. It is a stable place to be -- the country will always need the railroads. Plus, if you stick it out, you benefit from railroad retirement!

Prepare to ""put in your time."" This can be a good thing because there is much to learn -- its a big and complex business. However, career movement is encouraged so grow your professional network and find ways to place yourself in new roles every few years. The variety is a relief and it helps you grow long-term as you consider future promotional opportunities.

UP has provided me with many opportunities to grow and develop. They also have compensated me very well which has changed the outlook for my family. I am grateful for that. I just wish I still felt engaged and committed to them.
","Enter with caution. There were widespread changes pushed from the top down and they were not well-received by the workforce. Morale is terribly low. Employees are exiting in droves and will continue to do so. Rumors are flying of a mass exodus after bonuses next spring (if you want to get a foot in the door, that may be the time). Confidence is senior leadership has dwindled. In their defense, some change was definitely necessary. This is an ""old school,"" ""good ole boy"" type of organization that is trying very hard to change and recruit new talent. However, with the expectations (see above), I worry that they will always fail to retain a new generation of workers. If anything, change needs to happen faster, but in a cumbersome and leader-thick environment like UP's it is doubtful it can keep up with more desirable companies. They focus is too much on the ""shareholders"" and stock price. It is evident to most employees that leaders care more about their own compensation (which is largely based in stock options) than retaining good talent.

Mid-career hires are forced to play the game and climb the ladder....again. This is pretty standard in most companies, but UP especially cleaves to the ""putting in your time"" process. They maintain silly things like the MDSC which is basically a requirement if you want to be in a sales role....even if you have years of direct sales experience. You'll get placed with people straight out of college with little to no work experience and forced to complete the program before being hired for other opportunities. Frankly, I think they need a different programs for mid-career professionals and it feels insulting to people. No one wants to go into the program, but they are ""highly encouraged"" by their managers who know they wont get hired without it.

There is a lot of spin and self-help/business book talk but very few honest answers. Many sacrifices are made in the name of cost-saving initiatives, but the massive inefficiency in poor management, turnover, etc appears to be largely left unaddressed. You would think the company was going bankrupt or something by the depth of the cost cutting (for example, no Christmas tree) but yet, it is still a reliable, successful and VERY profitable company that has been, and will continue to be, around for many years as a core part of the US economy.

Only two weeks of vacation for your first FIVE years of employment!

","Extra board hours are volatile at best. You need to condition your mind and body for that. (Its been this way since the beginning of the railroad over 150 years)

Upper management like Cameron Scott believe ""keep 'em scared of losing their job and they'll work harder for you"". 

The company does fast track promoting to managers (MOP's and DRO's) for getting the most firings and write ups. I.E. If seen, by one of these managers, you WILL be written up for even the most mundane ""rule infraction"" I.E. Not pausing long enough before getting off equipment or not looking both ways long enough before crossing tracks. You WILL be pulled from service and drug tested ON THE SPOT if they're listening and don't hear you repeat a track number properly for a red zone or a track shove. Those are just a couple of MANY examples. They've happened and I've witnessed it.

Company is top heavy. There are assistant VPs to assistant EVPs and so on. Way too much management.

Morale is lower at my location than it ever has been before.

The company doesn't pay legitimate claims on a daily basis and they over-hire and furlough constantly while paying out upper and middle management bonus and increase shareholder dividends.

UP listens to the lawyers more than us, the guys who are out here doing the actual real work and know the territory. They make decisions with little to zero input from us. At least not in Chicago.

The pure principal and basic defiance of logic is enough to aggravate the most level headed of individuals here. Your sense of alacrity will diminish quickly. We continuously need to condition our minds and bodies to survive this company. It's really amazing how we stay at UP.

","Oh boy, where to start!? I have 20 years with this company and it is just a bad place to work. I was promised to make a 6 figure income with-in a few years 20 years ago when I hired out. I left a job that paid $65,000 back then and it took 15 years to to make that much again. I have had oppertunities to make almost 100,000 a year but it requires giving the company 80 to 100 hours a week of my time working and being away from home ""which by the way they don't pay you for when they force you out of town or to stay in their disgusting unclean company hotels""! It was a good place to work but the way they treat their employees is inhumane and degrading now. Also the pay hasn't kept up with inflation and now I make a smidge more than some of the college kids serving and restaurants! That is based off a 40 hour work week. You could make more but will have to work a road trio for 12 to 14 hours then stay in a dirty railroad hotel away from your family for 16 hours and work another 12 to 14 hour train back to your hometown. Then you will get 10 to 12 hours with your family ""most of which you will use to sleep"" then do the 40 to 44 hour trip all over again! Then you might make 100,000 a year but you gotta do that all year long! Also the medical benefits used to be top notch. Now it is comparable to any other average job out there so don't let them fool you by saying they are good because they used to be but not anymore. 

 The union can never get decent pay raises either. It doesn't matter what president is in office they always get tiny pay raises with contracts and boost that they did a good job negotiating. In comparison my pay is about 75% higher than when I hired out 20 years ago. But the average house in my area costs 300% more than 20 years ago. Food is at least 100% more. Cars are like 150% more. Utilities are 200% more, And just about everything I can think of has at least doubled. My pay hasn't doubled that's for sure! It's not even close to average inflation. If you factor in $400 the union takes per month and how much monthly insurance is taken out then my 75% increase in pay over 20 years goes down even more. Then the union takes $400 bucks a month, ""that includes job insurance which you pretty much have to buy because you WILL get fired at some point for something."" Anyways this old dog doesn't like learning nee tricks so I trying to hold out for retirement but if your young and considering the Union Pacific take my advice and go to college and get a job that will make you happy. This job WILL NOT make you happy.

I knew the game when I hired out 20+ years ago but it is much worse now. Morale is the lowest I have ever seen. Remember who helps make you those multi billion dollar profits every quarter or you will lose them to the companies that do.

Pros
- Great pay, benefits, plenty of opportunities for social interactions with co-workers and giving back to the community.
Cons
- Various 'Departments' are siloed; it can be hard to advance / get promoted outside of the initial area where you get hired in.
- Their Omaha office is far from the 'better' residential areas and the 'better' school districts. Parking is very expensive for the convenient, close-by options.

very poor execution of staff reduction program. UP will spend $450 Million in a year to buy back executive stock, and to pay for it, they fire the people that got the company to profitability, and issue more debt. In 2016 they did an employee survey, would like to see one done now!
