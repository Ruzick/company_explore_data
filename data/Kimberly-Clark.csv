Advice to Management
Be honest with co-ops. When looking for co-op experiences, students are looking for a place to work long term so they work as hard as possible to get a good performance review even though recruiters and managers knew there were no positions to begin with. Myself and most other co-ops this year would have gone with other companies and been in a secure position to receive full time offers from them had we known this is how you all treat co-ops.

","The culture in Minneapolis is awful and driven by the team lead, however nothing is addressed because numbers are being met. There is constant turn over as a result of this culture. Be prepared to have no opinion and spend hours of your life going in non productive/ dead end circles to appease the team lead. This results in working long hours to get your actual work done. Everybody acknowledges and mocks the nonsense ""work"" behind closed doors, but again nothing is addressed. There is unhealthy competition in this office with no true sense of team, again driven largely by this one person who will twist anything to pin people against eachother in an effort to ""hear"" what she wants.
Advice to Management
You can have culture and still put up numbers. The fact there has been so much turnover in this office and nothing done to address it shows where culture ranks in priority at KC. People will work harder for leaders that are enjoyable, fair, and respect their teammembers. There is a reason internal applicants do not apply for roles in Minneapolis.

Sun Jun 07 2020, Finance Manager,"Roswell, GA",Former Employee ,Interesting experience,7,"I learned a lot at KC. There are a lot of opportunities to improve yourself as a professional and the people I worked with were great. I believe the compensation is also above average.
","Kimberly Clark is better than most when it comes to promoting African Americans and people of color but in Finance they are lacking considerably. There is a clear unconscious bias towards people of color within Finance and I had a senior leader admit as much to me in a conversation. Finance is dominated by white men and there is virtually no representation at a leadership level when it comes to people of color and absolutely no representation when it comes to African Americans. There were a number of women in high level positions but they left during the restructure and were replaced with white men. 

Also, experience outside of KC from a Finance perspective is not valued. I applied for a job that would have been a promotion. I was told that I interviewed well but hadn't started my career at KC and therefore the role would not be offered to me even though I had several years of external experience. The role was given to a white male who was a level below me (2 level promotion for him) and the hiring manager offered a role to me reporting into the white male at a level lower than I was at.

Finally, there is a lot of value placed on non value added presentations and managers and leaders that bloviate/pontificate at KC. Also simple processes at other companies are completely over complicated there. A lot of the systems are not what you would expect at a company so large. As an example, instead of using a known system like Hyperion for financial reporting, Anaplan is used which is more of data analytic software than it is a financial reporting package.

Overall, if you are a minority or an external candidate at a manager level in Finance, I would avoid KC. Also, I would avoid roles that are not in a business unit. Central roles (GNW/Global Supply Chain) are not as respected.

The past CEO drove the business into the ground by cutting everything (FORCE) except investor dividends.

Leadership is relying on the largest restructuring plan in history which sadly will eliminate hundreds if not thousands of jobs.

The health insurance options are satisfactory.
","Job security is low due to spin-offs (Halyard Health Spin-off), Outsourcing (Genpact) and automation (Corporate Process Improvements also known as layoffs). 

There is little room for advancement and the departments are very compartmentalized. 

Management looks down upon wanting to transfer to other departments internally, even after you have been in your role for a couple years.

On average, a workweek is about 50 hours. 

Between 1 and 2% raises per year and no bonuses.

The Knoxville office pays significantly less than other KC locations, oftentimes to do similar jobs.

Management plays favorites with employees.

Other KC locations will not consider you for job opportunity transfers because the pay grades are generally much better in those locations and they wonder why you are in such a poor paying job.

Performance reviews are subjective.

Asking management what is required is impossible since everyone just shrugs their shoulders or tells you to ask someone else then the next person does the same thing.

Executive management firmly believes that processes need to be simplified, and tasks need to be leaned out. However, the requests for information and justification they make to middle management requires middle management to collect KPI's, justifications, reasons, documentation, and a myriad of other activities which leads to the bureaucracy.

Fri Jan 11 2019,Anonymous,"Knoxville, TN",Former Employee ,Leadership out of touch,11,"-Flexible work arrangements are great (home and office)
-Education/class opportunities great
-Benefits 
-Opportunities to grow within are available, however this is also a con because I've seen an equal number of externals hired over internal candidates with no priority given, despite the always-superficial leadership standard responses to this issue. 
-Many more I'm likely blanking out on; this certainly isn't the worst company to work for.
","-Leadership extremely out of touch with what it's actually like at the business/lower levels. ""K-C values"" and behaviors not consistent throughout company. Listened to too many leadership talks while going through contradictory initiatives of the absolute farthest-away degree. This obviously instills a distrust in leadership and lacking transparency.
-Culture change over the most recent 5-10 years from value to cost and quantity (extreme outsourcing, cutting corners, the thinking desktop procedures alone are superior to or can replace job-knowledge, etc.). 
-Never feel comfortable due to never knowing how safe any job is at any time. Major employee reductions every so many years imminent. I've watched some of the sharpest, most talented be eliminated or outsourced and the knowledge built go out the door with them. Want to guess how broken current processes become when turnover is increased/ongoing? 
-Degrees required for jobs that don't remotely match the required education level, excluding and preventing opportunities for competent candidates in an already-worsening market.
-Brutal interview process
-Distrust → discomfort among employees due to incompetency supported vs. held accountable (ex: when bad mgmt is in position). Accountability only flows one direction. 
-Solid good or great is still never good enough. Again, with the constant restructuring and degree of expectations, in the end it doesn't matter how good you are at your job vs others.
Advice to Management
Now-a-days it's impossible to take much this company does seriously. Company culture in certain areas (CI, flexibility, home/work life balance, etc.) has improved, but many others have deteriorated (overall value of employees, value of local employees, transparency needs work, abundant contradictions (in the marketed vs applied realistic priorities). 

If company values are tied to so many processes, the behaviors, COA, etc. need to flow both directions. Higher-up leadership benefiting from the accomplishments of lower-level employees in the current ""structure"" translates to desperate attempts to meet goals for the sake of bonuses (vs. actions based on business reasons). These priorities also completely exclude those DOING the actual work and busting their tail to keep the company ahead. The gap between the bottom and top is very, very drastic and not positively looked upon. 

I was a great, solid employee and know my worth: always achieved goals, went the extra mile, ensured processes were followed by those around me... the list goes on. Yet in the most recent years, I worked with rarely-accountable people who ""got away with murder"" and those people operate under unjust power and support, watched the best people be passed up or forced out, and experienced the expectations of working there become ""playing the game"" vs doing a good job or supporting good business decisions. 

The decision was made to take my worth elsewhere where it gets the freedom, kindness, and visibility it deserves. K-C ""caring"" has become a joke, unfortunately.

","HR policies create significant non-value-added work and do not reward experience - excessive requirements for documenting annual job performance, cookie-cutter approaches to 1:1's and anything related to performance, forced ranking promotes scarcity of rewards versus having a culture where there is an over abundance of reward for doing well; incentive for making more money is not based on performance, rather it is based on getting promotions; team leaders and management often have no experience in their department and have no clue or appreciation for what their employees do which seems very counter intuitive to cultivating a successful management structure and establishing highly enabled and engaged workers.
Advice to Management
Reinvent HR. Get a new CEO - not because the current CEO is awful but new blood is needed. Stop promoting managers to their roles when they have no experience in the department - rather, place more importance on promoting experienced individuals and growing their talent.

Passive aggressive culture, where tough/candid conversation don't happen. They're so relationship focused that the CEO had to issue a memo a couple years ago highlighting that 'conflict' was ok. Innovation is product focused vs consumer focused. Given recent financial troubles, significant change is needed in their culture and approach to business, but it will take years.

","Organization does not believe in developing internal talent. Senior roles filled mostly externally. What few words that are communicated do not match the organization’s actions. There is very little, if any, accountability/ownership for decisions. There is no onboarding, so when the environment is tough, there’s nothing for recent tenured employees to hang onto - so they leave. There is no higher purpose - if all we hear is “cut costs, cut costs!” That’s not incentive to add discretionary effort needed to turn the organization around. Petty - but the parking garage has MANY empty spaces, not to mention those now vacant due to voluntary and involuntary departures- so why is the waiting list so long?

Thu May 10 2018, Field Technician,"Corinth, MS",Former Employee ,My time @ KC,5,"KC has good benefits such as insurance & stock options, it was my experience while employed there was short lived because they would hire unqualified employees that were hired only because they were a minority or a female. I had no problem with working with either had they been capabile of learning the job task, however they were not which caused the few employees that were qualified to go back and fix the inadequate job's for them. By doing so the qualified employees stayed angry, had the company assigned a supervisor over the unqualified employees and a raise to go along with the responsibility the qualified one's wouldn't have quit. As if this wasn't enough to quit management at that time was gulable into believing some of the manipulative lying backstabbing employees that we're trying to get the qualified employees fired because they didn't like the ones that could actually perform all job task efficiently & correctly. So yes the politics were a real problem as well as the slackers inability to measure up to the ones who actually deserve the gainful employment Kimberly Clark offered. No one can make this up so believe what I'm telling you, the job itself was refreshing & fast paced which I thourally enjoyed it was just the wicked & inadequate employees I had a problem with. One last thing, the crew that we relieved at shift change would intentionally sabotage the machinery to try to cause us to not make rate & yield by leaving nuts, bolts, loose, settings of dozens of correct settings rearranged, this just made me a better operator than I already was so when that crew came in to relieve us they couldn't believe we had corrected their tampering & exceeded rate & yield. This is why I left for a company that would recognize & compensate me for my skill level. My best friend still working there told me it has gotten even worse & that management had to install camera's everywhere even the bathrooms because of all of the sneaking & manipulating. I can see why & how Kimberly Clark is laying off thousands of unneeded employees.

Mon Jul 31 2017, Shopper Marketing Manager,,Former Employee ,A great place to work,1,"Flex-schedule. I worked in a job share which was ideal for a working mom. 
Good benefits, fair pay. 

Very little travel (pro for me), collaborative brand teammates, the marketing department had several women in leadership roles
","The overall organization has a bit of a ""good old boys"" club feel. There was a specific male leader in the company who treated minorities and women poorly, and he seemed to be protected from repercussion. He was the only ""bad seed"" I came in contact with, but it was concerning the lack of attention HR paid to the several complaints he received. 

It is a traditional office environment, where there is an expectation to be in the office 8-5 on the days you are working. It isn't necessarily a con, but compared to other major CPGs, KC is slow to adopt new ideas about healthy working environments. 

I worked out of a sales office, and the only real opportunities for advancement required transferring to headquarters in Appleton, WI.

Good team members depending on the department you are employed in, there is a very family like atmosphere. Good work/life balance for long term employees.
","The culture is bipolar on many levels. Complicated levels of corporate programs that require HOURS of training but are never implemented and set everyone up for noncompliance. Seemed like a new system was being implemented every year and directives and training are extremely vague. Huge disconnect between global and regional goals. Managers in positions do not understand what they need or want, constantly mislead staff and then blame the staff for the mistakes. Feels like you're being led into failure. The culture has changed vastly over the years and many team members are extremely passive aggressive as a result. Sharky behavior is not dealt with appropriately and personnel are not held to the standard that the global objectives direct. They talk a good talk, but don't walk the walk. It is not unheard of for contract staff to work for years (+5) in a position only to watch coops and new engineers being hired left and right when these support positions NEVER have the opportunity of becoming permanent. If a company offers someone a contract position for that long, clearly that individual is value added Head count is always restrictive and the company is always undergoing reorganization which offers zero value to the departments affected and creates a culture of fear and people who lack accountability. Contract and partner personnel are treated extremely poorly. Janitorial, facilities management and other service teams are blamed for KC employees not following their own program. Safety program is a means to finger point and find fault while no KC employees are ever held accountable when safety concerns exist.
Advice to Management
KC was once an amazing culture. With a very high emphasis on people. When considering talent, consider those who have worked for your company for years in contract positions rather than hiring externally. You don't have enough gears to power your engine. Too management top heavy and not enough entry level positions for talented work staff. Enforce the programs you already have in place before implementing new ones that are never enforced. Focus more on personal and professional accountability than the blame game. Work together to find real solutions rather than being defensive and passive aggressive.

Upper management and HR needs to become more involved with the processes that can be detrimental to peoples upward movement and get in tune with what is really going on. It might surprise them (upper management and HR) as to the reality of what is happening. Culture of Accountability doesn't exist and needs to be reinforced if this is truly what the company wants. It needs accountability at all levels and its not happening. The company has a track record of introducing change that it never truly embraces. Its been three years and there is little to no change for the culture, people still go straight to managers to complain while not giving people a chance to hear about it before it goes to that level.

Tue Mar 14 2017, Sales Analyst,,Former Employee ,"Good Company, for the right personality types",7,"-Large company with strong history and strong brands within ""necessities"" categories
-Good growth opportunities, if you fit the culture and have the right personality type
-Good shorter run (2-3 years) company for building early resume and experience
-Fair pay, good benefits
-Good people
","-Company is very process oriented and work standardization focused. Most of your tactical work will follow some kind of standard process that has checkpoint forms to complete on top of the task itself. While this benefits, for example, a new college graduate that is learning the basics, it can become time consuming, monotonous, robotic, etc. the more experience you have. Processes and work standardization prevent the company from being as agile and adaptable as it could be. Company is much more reactive culturally and it can take considerable time (years) to adapt to new ways of thinking and working. The company is also not very innovative and is more reserved/conservative in what they will invest in. Strategies are often recycled from previous years. Cyclical restructuring and cost cutting tend to be primary strategic vehicles as opposed to true innovation. If you value a certain degree of ""work freedom"", enjoy using experience based instincts, like the ability to work outside of processes, or don't like to feel micromanaged by processes, you will most likely be happier with another organization.

-Company is also very meeting structured. On average, you will spend half of your work week preparing for, attending, or reacting to a meeting. Meetings can be redundant and. at times are a hindrance to your day to day tactical work. If you enjoy this type of structure, you will be fine. If you value more ad hoc problem solving, off the cuff team dynamics, less structured/white space friendly environments, you will likely be happier with another organization.

-Company has a ton of turnover and leadership constantly pushes that ""they need talent"" or ""are talent short"". Internally, the company will move people into new roles regularly. While this is good for individual experience and exposure, employees are so time crunched from meetings and processes that training suffers. A lot of folks don't stay in a role long enough or have the white space to become a functional expert. You also do spend a bit of cyclical time bringing new team members up to speed on basics. The culture basically creates an environment where you'll learn to do quite a few basic things decently but the flip side to the coin is, you'll need to use off work time to learn and absorb how to do things great. Folks hired from outside have a hard time adapting to all the process work and lack of white space and often leave after a year or two. In fairness, there are quite a few employees that started with and stayed with the company for the long run. If it's the only culture you know or if you like a lot of structure and process, you'll enjoy the company. Lastly, if you value feeling like you're caught up on things at the end of the average day, this company is not going to be a good fit for you.

-Upper management at times is oblivious to tactical, day to day white space needs and can't seem to connect the dots between the burying culture of meetings/process work and the continued talent gap.

-Software systems are inefficient, inflexible, and numerous.

-Culture of moving people around frequently has created a lot of middle management roles and specialty teams. Good for the long run career opportunities but causes simple tasks to require multiple communication channels, red tape, unneeded processes, and delays in decision making. What takes a day to get approved in most organizations can take weeks with KC

-Again, it is a good company but it's simply not for everyone. I'd recommend knowing your work and management style(s) well (what you find motivating, demotivating, etc.) before going to work at KC.
Advice to Management
-You keep wondering why you have a talent gap yet you never seem to consider that certain aspects of the culture does not appeal to some personality types. Quite a few talented people perform best when given the white space to explore opportunities and dig into the details. Quite a few talented people don't like to feel buried in processes or micromanaged by processes but instead put value in finding new ways to do things, a certain degree of work freedom, and an environment where creativity, adaptability, and agility is embraced. Change the culture a bit and you'll find more talent. Keep doing things the same way and you'll likely see the talent hole get deeper.

Mid-level managers have zero business managing people due to lack of proper training or resourcing by HR. Anyone with a leadership role is paid an enormous salary & those leaders do zero actual work but sit around & talk & make plans for what & how their measly paid team members will accomplish for them next. Career growth is non-existent unless you are a decent looking white girl willing to kiss a lot of ---- or a good old boy with family ties within the organization. Nepotism is rampant & the promotions & largest salaries are paid based on who's who instead of experience, knowledge, & skill. Constant change leaves those in the trenches doing the work miserable, underpaid, & in fear of being the next to be fired. But KC doesn't fire people, they instead force people they don't like into resignation by picking on them until they can't take it anymore. It is obvious management discriminates based on age, race, creed, & if you don't fit the Mold of a WASP or are homosexual, older, unmarried in your 30s, etc & don't hob knob with your leaders & kiss their you know what's you can bet you will be set up to fail. The level of management that oversees most of the workforce is given too much power for an organization of KCs size with too little training & that is what leads working for KC to feel more like attending high school where the pretty & popular are on top; instead of like in real life where the nerds & hard workers succeed. Having had experience with multiple large, global organizations, I would have to say my experience with KC was the absolute worst & not just limited to one department or business sector within the KC organization, while most organizations do operate somewhat on a who knows who basis, KC will absolutely run themselves into the ground in the near future if they do not become more diversified, value real talent, & stop having the ""too big to fail"" attitude. 

Decisions are made on a complete whim regarding software systems & IT enhancements. Motto seems to be, let's just do it now & deal with customer recourse, worker capabilities, & customer satisfaction later.

There are too few levels of management - while upper management sets a vision & goal, only 2 rungs down the ladder are inexperienced, untrained people trying to execute said vision & goal without the knowledge, skill, management capabilities, etc to execute any course of action that is long lasting and sustainable.

Real nice Cafeteria and really nice gym as an option to work out in during breaks or days off. Nice but only a few took advantage of it. Generous on breaks. 4 30 minute breaks with 12 hour shifts. Benefits, great 401k. insurance ok. A lot of perks.
","Only bad thing about this job was the rotating shifts 3 on 3 off 12 hour shifts 7-7 either way and rotate days/nights after days off, it was difficult but mandatory overtime made it worse. Overtime would land on a 4th straight day or even worse in the middle of your 3 days off which would rotate what you just worked. Without overtime you would end up with 2 weekends off a month but mandatory overtime was frequent. If it wasn't for the rotating schedule I could or would of retired there. Hourly Wages to low.

I found out later that KCC is known to hire over qualified people at very low positions and making them work through the ranks. Also there is a level system 1-14 with 14 being the lowest. If you are applying, be aware of what level the position you are applying for is as you have to stay in a position for 18+ months before you can move to another position and unless you know someone, you can only move within 2 ""ranks"" of where you are.

","Retirement plan is unbelievably disappointing. No chance of being financially able to actually retire for those hired after 2004. New hire policy implemented over the last couple years severely holds back the ability to ever make top wages for new hires.

Restructure current retirement plan to enable those hired after 2004 to have the abilty to ACTUALLY retire one day. Change recent new hire policy to enable those with ""work-ethic"", ambition and drive to be able to advance their wages.

I have been working at Kimberly-Clark full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Everyone makes a lot of great friends here and salaries are competitive in atl we just redid all our buildings with a cool modern look including an outdoor theme with an airstream trailer and deer on the conference room roof 2 buildings have freestyle coke machines and fancy latte cappuccino coffee machines. Benefits are decent icluding a 3% 401k match at 100% and then 2% at 50%. big company with many different sub businesses to explore and lots of free training you can do can wear jeans all the time but most don't lots of fun team building and chances for bonus at more senior individual contributor positions
Cons
Slow bureaucratic company and largest amount of jobs are in Wisconsin or mills in the middle of nowhere although there are a few exceptions like atl most people think the grass is greener on the other side at kc only started bringing in outside people in the last 10 years in more significant numbers so not very good at onboarding we are a matrix organization with a lot of unwritten rules it can take a lot of time to acclimate also tend to be risk adverse and unlikely to be promoted in place need to change roles or departments

For some, a pro would be job security--people are always going to need toilet paper. Hard to foresee a plant closure coming, though.
At the Everett mill we had flex Fridays, which was an awesome perk, but I don't believe they do that at other mills.
","Working for a big corporation, dealing their systems, the time I took to make a change (lots of red tape).
SAP--not user friendly and their system of choice.
The 360 review process and managers being forced to put certain percentages of employees in box 1-9. If a manager isn't well spoken and able to fight for employees, or if their is favoritism or office politics going on, this is a poor way to evaluate performance.
Then there's the obvious--the fact that it's ultimately about the bottom line and if they need to close a site to keep profits growing, they're going to make that business decision. Can't say I blame them, but next time around I'd like to work somewhere where the employees and customers come first.
They still enforce a dress code, or at least they did as recently as 2012. They should get with the times. Take a look at the culture of companies like Amazon.com, Microsoft, Expedia and see what they are doing in big and small ways (like casual dress being allowed) to make the job more enjoyable for their employees.

Management takes care of their own, senior leaders make buckets of money through stock options etc. while passing out less than 1% merit increases to the balance of the organization.

I’ve worked for four other companies in my 25 year career and been exposed to hundreds of others as a consultant, and there is no doubt this is the best culture I’ve worked for or been exposed to. The company has focused on developing a culture where employees understand the mission and vision, and then focus their work on supporting it. Employees are accountable for their work, we ask is there more I can do, and focus on solving problems rather than pointing fingers. The most fantastic part of this, is that it isn’t just in North America, this culture is global. I”ve worked on several global projects, and the culture is consistent across the globe. It is a great experience to have a global workforce pulling from the same side of the rope, all modeling our winning behaviors.

Looking down the barrel of a 30+ year career, I've seen good and bad from KC. Right now, it's mostly bad.

The company just reissued an engagenement survey...the same as done 2-3 years ago. The results then were pretty abysmal, but none of that feedback got management action. No doubt, this survey will yield the same results. I'm sure it's a warm feeling in the pants of top management, but when will management really listen? All those employees can't be completely wrong.

Get back in touch. Mill workers feel management is out of touch. Professionals think they're out of touch. Go spend some time on the shop floor...in the marketing and sales offices. See what the real issues are...and meditate on what you fine before making your next cost-cutting decision.

Pick a direction and a corporate mission that's real and home-grown. The consultants are sucking money out of you. You know he business, the assets and capabilities. Whatever you decide, resouce it and stick with it.

If you are a person of color, black, brown, yellow or any shade in between, save your career and stay away. There is a reason why there are so many discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuits against this company. The folks who are promoted are mere puppets. Incompetence is constantly rewarded and applauded. If you are a smart and hardworking white guy/gal, be prepared to head out, because you are a threat to the establishment. They will find a way to push you out. If you are Jewish, good luck. Be prepared for some isolation. There is no scale to measure the antisemitic index. Simply put discriminatory environment and racist management. Do not fall for some of the glowing and positive reviews on Glassdoor. Most likely they are paid temps, just loading up on positive ratings so as to keep the average above 3. Yeah, they have done that too. Mckinsey consultants now hold key positions within the company and will most likely split it up and sell it in pieces. So, no future prospects what so ever. Stay away.

Advice to Management
Solid organizational/management structure in place already. As an established manufacturing company, I felt management was a bit too risk adverse at times for fear of decisions having unintended consequences. I think management should take a few more innovative/creative risks to drive future performance instead of resting on KC's strong brand image and economies of scale. It felt like the company was managed very well overall, but managers were trying to maintain the status quo as opposed to improving the company for the future.

","- Senior mgmt is completely out of touch, yet they try so hard to make you believe they care. Pathetic.
- Lower level managers try to please their bosses to be the next ""pet"".
- SO much talent has left this company it is truly sad. Experience is not valued.
- Company has been on a 8 year cost savings journey that now has come to ""Burn the Furniture"".
- The next step to save money is to implement new pay standards to become ""competitive"". This is easily seen as cutting salaries and benefits.
- Performance Management system that continues to kill morale while wasting tons of time.

Clothing allowance went 160 to 80 no longer offer us to buy an extra week vacation what was called FLEX DAYS and said they took that away because they were having to backfill those jobs when they don't let anybody work any overtime so that's WRONG. We used to be able to come in and work on our career plans and also help out on the floor wherever needed. Most people take a major cut in pay to come to Loudon Mill and that used to be ok because we could come in and work overtime to make up for the lost wages. All the new management has done since they have been here is take away or fire people. Loudon HAD a TEAM CONCEPT but now we don't really have any say so in anything. They being Management have took what we at Loudon have worked 20 years to accomplish, (career plans, the way things are handled, vacation coverage, sick leave coverage, and etc.) and thrown it out the door. They say if don't like it here, go find you another job. They don't seem to care about their employees at all anymore. Can't say I would tell anybody it's a good place to work anymore. Used to love going to work and now that's all changed.
Advice to Management
Go away. Get people like we used to have that care about the employees and involve us in discussions that are effecting our lives and our families. Don't give Tom Falk all these bonuses when you take away from the workers.

It is not only respected by management, but expected as well. Giving its employees the appropriate work load, strongly supports this mentality. 

Also, the company is great at providing communication from its senior management in an effective and personal way, lending opportunities for direct interaction with them in a non threatening environment.

Lastly, benefits and compensation are competitive at my current level. There is clearly an incentive to work at Kimberly Clark and to perform to the best of one's abiltiy.

The company stresses work/life balance-which can be seen by the number of employees involved in company softball, volleyball, kickball, golf, flag football leagues. There are workout facilities on site that offer personal training, spin class, yoga, etc. Just about everybody I have met at the company is nice and willing to help out if you need it which provides for a great work enviornment.

Get people more involved in decision making by providing them the opportunity and the responsibility. Lower level managers are often not as knowledgeable or resourceful in dealing with hourly crews (in the mills) and therefore tend to rely on engineering staff to provide the ownership. This startegy works well for the short run but long term development of the hourly crew suffers and therfore the total team performance remains the same.

","Unfair evaluation system - Started out putting people in a bell shaped curve for performance. That was OK.

That meant if you looked crosseyed at someone you were lowered in the next review because what else did they have to go on - ""somebody has to be a three"". 
Managers cannot manage people. Middle managers were promoted based on their ability to do the work rather than manage the work. As a result managers are very bad at evaluating people fairly and distributing the work to those who have the ability to do it.
