Advice to the Ceo:
For being a big company that charges 2x more than other competitors you should be paying your employees more. Although i don't work for your company anymore, i know there is hard working people that work their butts off and make your whole company run. Youre as big as Walmart and they pay 11.50. You shared a bunchof ""thank you"" videos in the beginning of the pandemic but those are just WORDS they don't help. Show appreciation like Walmart does. I work there now... way better.

Tue Jan 19 2021, Butcher,"Temecula, CA",Current Employee ,Less than fair,0,"The only pro I can conjure up from the void of despair that is this work environment would be the union's assistance when requesting days off for schooling.
","Work is often compensated based on the level of responsibility given. Hard simple work is not expensive because the employee is replaceable. As a butcher block clerk in the Albertsons corporation you are not given a raise, you remain on the same payment track as the entry level employees (baggers/courtesy clerks). Your department may be kept understaffed to maintain higher profits. The work load combined with poor scheduling has caused my department to run through 5 new employees in less than a year. If you are a college student you will be called in on your days that are designated for school, if you do not come in to work you will be punished with being transferred to another department, another store, you may have your hours cut, and there will be blatant feelings and words of hostility thrown your way.

 The union, when looked at from a historical standpoint has been the life saver of the working class since its founding in Europe a hundred and something years ago, today, the union ""helps"". It ""helped"" me not get fired when a store director bullied me, it ""helped"" me avoid termination when another store director yelled at me due to the lies of a customer, it ""helped"" avoid termination when they were pushing me to come in on my days off for school. It doesn't help when coworkers are immune to termination all the while they quite literally refuse to work, leaving their mess for your cleanup. It doesn't help when coworkers with poor work ethics are given their $00.10 raise at the same rate(every 600 hours if their process hasn't changed in the last couple of years) as you, the responsible employee, are given yours. It doesn't help when a check-stand worker that has been employed for one year is making more than you, while you have been employed for 5 years. The union fell ill, it has taken the old school, early, stereotype and thrived on it, don't be fooled, the union is not there to help, ironically enough the union has capitalized on greed, and is there for money and nothing more. 
 
 Now, as a first job I recommend Albertsons, once you leave here the only thing that can leave you more miserable would be working fast food. In turn it makes everything else look like a walk in the park. It is not hard, physically demanding, dangerous work, it is mentally and emotionally excruciating.
Advice to Management
Tell your employees ""good job"", ""good work"" more frequently, it goes a long way in such a straining work environment. 

When an employee makes a mistake, do not forget about the good work they have done up until that point in time. There currently is no balance, balance does not exist between the two. Negative, anger fueled ""motivation"" is the only thing I have witnessed in my 5 years.

I think maybe a little more direction for new employees might make the transition into the job a little smoother. The tests are helpful as well but there were a lot of things that were not on the tests. It would've been nice to have had someone walk me through what an average day would look like.

Cons
Random non-consistent hours
Management doesn’t always make sure everyone is doing their job
Regardless of if you’re miles of colleagues in the same position in terms of performance, you will both be paid the same, and will not be recognized for your work.
Advice to Management
Give incentives, recognize, and promote people who are doing better, than their mediocre counterparts. Nothing is more unmotivating than putting in all the hard work, only for people who don’t do the same to be promoted. Management needs to be rotated between stores periodically, as older management who’ve been around longer, become mean to employees, side/favor employees they’ve known longer, go greedy with power, intimate, and boss people around instead of focusing on building a functioning team.

The management at my store are comforting and friendly, while still keeping the assertive, PIC demeanor. They’re honestly the only reason why I haven’t quit already. To the People in Management, you guys need to have a serious talk with employees about being rude/ having an attitude towards people who are “ranked below them”, and have consequences set for people who are found doing so. I can work just fine if employees are being nice to me/each other, but the moment someone says something rude, I can’t focus on my work, and my job performance declines greatly... More talks about potential future promotions, and recognition on how one is completing their work would not only be very encouraging, but would boost morale and employee performance as well.

","In short, with the exception of being arrested and thrown in jail, my 10 years at Albertsons was the most humiliating experience of my adult life.

Stifling suppression and discouragement of innovative and creative thinking by micro meddling managers in fear of better ideas by people under their supervision and compelled by their personal insecurities and egos to impose their own will no matter what.

A toxic and oppressive atmosphere, incomprehensible incompetence and lack of accountability, double standards and hypocrisy, favoritism and nepotism.

Inadequate communication among peers and non at all between upper management and us lower tier drones. ""Need to know"" information depensed reluctantly by power tripping managers only after a crises occurs because we weren't told in advance.

Most feedback is negative. Hardly any positive reinforcement nor encouragement. I received no performance reviews in 9 years and only 2 thereafter. Motivation by intimidation and threat of termination.

No Human Resources presence at the store level. Definitive written policies & procedures have been hard to find for lower tier retail people so they don't know when their rights and priveleges are being abused.

Corporate personnel were often in the store but they might as well be in another world walking around distant and aloof, dismissing us hourly workers as peons.

Ludicrous policies & procedures mandated by clueless corporate clowns with no regard to the operational nightmares they created on the sales floor that actually aggravated the customer experience.

Schedules changed every week and every day of every week and posted in as little as 36 hours in advance. ""Full Time"" doesn't mean 40 hours/week, as little as 30hrs/week. With few exceptions only management and associates with decades of seniority can expect 40 hour weeks.

My accrued vacation hours disappeared after Albertsons merged with Safeway in 2016 and neither management nor Human Resources could or would fix it.

My experience at Albertsons bespeaks a company that will treat their retail grunts in the trenches like trash and arrogantly presume we don't have the courage, will or savvy to challenge them.

","They make you clean up EVERYTHING and belittle you if you do it wrong. 
They pay $7.25 an hour, which is less than the minimum wage.
I got ZERO training. They had another courtesy clerk show me where everything is, then I was thrown straight into the deep end.
They give breaks every 2 hours, but if you're given a task (like bringing in shopping carts or cleaning bathrooms) at the same time as your break, oh well. Sometimes you don't even have time for your break at all.
Customers are super rude (which isn't the company's fault, but if a customer complains about you, the managers will believe them and you'll be the one in trouble).
If you get a second job, the manager will go to great lengths to give you ridiculously less hours.
New employees get double the hours that employees who have been working there for months get, so as time goes on, you get even less hours, which earns you far less money with the $7.25/hr pay.

Thu Sep 05 2019,Anonymous,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,A sinking ship,5,"The benefits and perks are nice, the pay is competitive, and most all of the people in the company are great.
","Where to start...

1. The company has hit a wall and is desperate to try and find a silver bullet to save the business. 

2. Morale has not been the same since the layoffs in April. 

3. The parent company has become increasingly difficult to work with and they have unrealistic demands. 

4. Management and especially HR wants to keep everyone in the dark, and silence anyone who tries to bring attention to the fact that the company is not doing well. 

5. As people realize how bad things are, there has been a steady stream of people leaving the company. 

6. The direction and strategy of the company are no longer clear and have not been since Josh Hix, the old CEO and founder, left. Things are haphazardly implemented just for the sake of showing some kind of development, even if it does not drive overall growth. 

7. The new head of the company, who was put in place by the parent company, is hardly ever present in the NY office and it appears that support for Plated internally in the parent company is dwindling. 



There were some really great things about Plated that I loved when I first started, but over time those things have deteriorated and vanished. If you are looking for a job in the meal kit industry, I would recommend either joining HelloFresh or finding a different industry altogether.

Advice to Management
This plant would be more productive and responsive, if you'd just take the time to interact with the actual employees on the floor, not supervisors, but the actual day by day employees. Take the time to walk the floors bit with the purpose of instilling fear because your walking the floor, or give them the feeling that the only reason why your down there is because something hit the fan, but just to simply say, ""hi, thank you for all the hard work and hours you've put in so far"" believe it or not, that would lift spirits up, because the only time they hear about you guys up there is when something went wrong down there and no matter how good we did at some point it's never good enough because we are never reminded that we are all in this together.

They get upset if you try to call out for a good reason

This was on the Ryan Street #0717 location. There were a few managers who really got on my nerves. One is lazy, gave me unreasonable tasks (which required a few employees to complete on time) and expected me to do them by myself with no help while I watched the same person leave early, take days off, & made me cover those shifts without asking me how I felt about it. I was really tired considering I had a lot of weeks with one day off. The other thinks they can constantly criticize everything to the point where it got really irritating. It made me feel really bad and questioned myself. Another was just plain rude. I tried complaining to upper management, but I didn’t notice anything change so I was forced to report it to corporate. I have watched so many people in my department quit or transfer as they didn’t want to handle this. It got so bad to the point where I had to quit as well, I didn’t want to deal with this drama anymore.
Advice to Management
Leave your employees alone, don’t harass them because it will make them leave. If an employee gives you a complaint, take action and help them fix the issue, if you don’t, well you know what happens then. If they are showing up to work, doing their jobs, and not causing any problems, thats all you need to care about. Don’t overwork them.

If you thrive on fast-paced environments and enjoy a challenge, this department is for you.
","If you've never worked retail, this position is a nightmare. The bakery is always in high demand working at high volume. If you don't catch on quick, all you'll do is consistently lag behind and bring everyone else down with you. I'm not sure if every location is the same, but from day one of a full shift, I found myself struggling to keep up. And that was just with job shadowing. They expected me to be able to do a full shift -- with closing duties -- on my own after barely a week of training. Even after I mentioned several times that I've never done retail before in my life, my co-workers were getting frustrated with me. I don't blame them. Video training didn't cover the sheer demand of the job position. All it covered was cleaning duties, safety concerns, the fact that french bread gets baked, and a few tutorials on cake decorating... which I can find on YouTube.
Advice to Management
Don't throw new employees into closing duties after 5 full shifts. There needs to be a longer transitional period for completely clueless newcomers. And find a way to give departments more time to take a 10 minute break. You can't expect employees to damage their bladders from holding it in, or avoiding water for 4 hours at a time just to limit bathroom visits.

","The stores are primarily ran by the store director which caused many problems. Often times the store director treated courtesy clerks poorly and showed favoritism to associates that have been at the company for many years. Also, the front end managers would use profanity at me which is a clear union violation. Whenever corporate came to visit the store and gave negative feedback, the anger would trickle down to the people at the bottom instead of having a team discussion about improving the store. Also, I was employed during the merger with Safeway and the transition was a mess, with no clear sign of who our leadership was.
Advice to Management
Management usually talks to the store directors only and courtesy clerks don’t feel valued by corporate. I visit the store I worked at occasionally and they can never keep hardworking courtesy clerks for a reasonable period of time. I’d suggest that management meet with courtesy clerks and have a discussion about their growth in the company and how they can improve in their role. I’d also suggest to keep hiring high school students and provide scholarships because that’s a wonderful benefit to attract talent.

Tue Oct 09 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Ups and downs but Plated continues to pay off,10,"- Plated has an incredible culture. We champion each other and have a lot of fun together. Great events and food perks. 

- I've been at the company for a few years and have seen some ups and downs. It's not always the best but we seem to address the biggest issues eventually.

- There are some very salty former employees posting very negative reviews. All I can say is, reader beware. People are often former employees for VERY good reasons.
","- Because Plated is still a young company, we're still getting around to implementing a lot of the policies and processes that we really need.

- We haven't always been the best at coaching people who aren't raising the bar because we haven't either had enough managers, or given managers enough time to manage. This is changing though.

- Because we've been under resourced for so long, we work pretty long hours. Not everyone does, but you do if you're one of the people who gives a darn about contributing. Work/life balance could be better.

","The company has not spent the time, nor resources, to properly invest in the successful training of its employees. There is no formal training process, no centralized reference material, and there are no goals by which to measure an employee's success or skill. There is a lack of structure and the entire structure seemed to have been done reactively, rather than proactively. Although the employee base was very diverse racially, I witnessed some additional difficulties for some of a specific race. There was no diversity board or similar efforts to promote the values of a diverse workforce.

Sat Nov 17 2018,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,IT,4,"Most of the line level people I worked with were nice. There are some genuinely skilled and talented people working there. Salaries are generally good and is the only reason I don't rate it as one star.

Benefits used to be better when it was just Safeway but since the Albertsons acquisition the benefits have become decidedly average.
","Management is atrocious. 1950s management style is pervasive. Work from home is discouraged. Flexible work schedules are discouraged. Internal processes are rigid, inflexible and outdated. Management pretends to listen to concerns but does nothing about it. 

IT infrastructure is dominated by creaky, expensive, ancient mainframe systems. IT is seen as a cost center not a center of innovation. Contrast that with successful companies like Amazon where IT is a key player and they actually invest in IT.

Company is shouldering an enormous amount of debt which limits their ability to compete with the likes of Amazon (via Whole Foods) and WalMart. Stores are closing left and right and management has no answers to compete in the modern business environment.

In IT you will learn lots of useless non-transferable skills. If you are looking to build skills in anything developed in the last 10-15 years this is not the place for you.

Culture is a passive-aggressive political minefield. Navigating this quagmire is rewarded with promotions and bonuses. True leadership and accountability will get you marginalized.

Thu Sep 27 2018, Ex,"Irvine, CA",Former Employee ,Barista,2,"I can switch or take over a co-worker's shift, under approval of management.
","Due to the lack of baristas, sometimes I had to work while being sick! When I catch a cold during my shift, I was not allowed to go home. Do you really want a sick person making your customer's drinks?

I had to share tips with my co-workers, but the city's customer's do not know how to tip, so my weekly tips were less than $10! (You know which city)

Sometimes I have to operate the whole kiosk by myself during rush hours. 

I was not allowed to leave the kiosk, take a break, get items from the backroom unless there was another barista.

Lack of care and communication from management. I felt they did not care about their employees, expecting one person to close by themselves within a certain amount of time is extremely unfair. 

When you close by yourself, there are numerous of tasks, including cleaning ALL of the equipment, restocking inventory, dumping specific ingredients, throwing away all the trash, and proper storage of items. 

I never received my employee discount!!! I was told I would get an employee store card during orientation, but it never arrived. So, I spoke to my manager, but he claimed I should call the company line, which is useless too. Apparently, I can use the store app and log in my employee registration info, but it does not recognize my phone number. Odd since they call me when they need another barista for a shift. 

Hardly any company culture established.
Advice to Management
Please have at least two baristas at the kiosk, it can be extremely overwhelming with just one person working by themselves with there is long line. Having two people can ensure that one employee can retrieve items from the storage, due to inventory shortages, while there is one employee operating the kiosk. Also when employees give you more than 2 weeks in advance request for a day off or provide their work schedule with their other job, please don't schedule them during those times!

-seniority is represented by how many years you've been at the company over level of competency and can be frustrating

-company restructuring happens frequently and information is often with-held from employees based on convenience

-upper management acts like they care but will readily throw you under the bus if necessary to keep themselves intact, even if it means being contradictory and dishonest

-there's no room for employee growth whatsoever, so consider that when recruitment entices you with a nice salary range

-the benefits aren't as swanky as it sounds - there's no 401k matching and the breakfast is mostly fruit and bread. health benefits are mediocre and stipend has limitations and less than most companies of that size

","Constantly suffocating on labor, often do not know next week work schedule until 24 hours prior. Unbelievably rude customers, pay caps out at 17.49 for most department supervisors. Managers don't care bout you, only the labor. Because of the lack of hours to go around, you will be responsible for jobs other than your own and will be held accountable however overwhelmed you are. Upper management will go on vacation whenever they please even when interviews are to be conducted or positions to be selected but will deny everyone else's vacation.

","1. Upper management plainly doesn’t care about employees who do the actual work. They give their own production dates and let it roll. At the end all the devs suffer 
2. There is a high bias and discrimination in this company . The senior management is full of ex gap and ex Levi’s employees, so there is a lot of favoritism. If you are not from these two companies , it’s better not to join 
3. The growth is painstakingly very slow and salary increment doesn’t exist
4. There is no formal review process so you are left at the mercy of management to give promotions 
5. The work environment is very chaotic with ton of people as just managers and there are very less worker bees

Management does not take anything serious.

Maybe listen to your employees questions and concerns more instead of brushing them off. And while not expecting some big award, a thank you or job well done can go a long way for an employee.

When you are sick and call in, it is your responsibility to call other stores to find someone to fill in for you (seems like a manager job). If you can't find a replacement, you HAVE to go in. My coworker was sick as a dog. She came in in tears with a doctor's note, our boss made her work her shift.

They don't even know what the normal operation is. They continuously cut labor and increase work demands every year. They sit on their comfy chair with AC blowing at full force and make thoughtless decisions. It's unfortunate because these are the people that are causing stores to close and running down the company. These old corporate folks need to leave, retire, or step down and let those that truly care about growing the company take over.

Fri Jan 26 2018, Night Stocker,"Missoula, MT",Former Employee ,Worst in Missoula maybe all of Montana,3,"My coworkers were fun to be around.
","I was a ""Night Stocker"" only on truck nights (3 per week), this store ""Eastgate"" is right next to the University and goes thru almost all of its stock each week, due to high demand.

PAY 
- small & didn't change, per management there would be NO increases ever.. Funny how the store with the highest sales in town can have the worst pay & lowest staffing, with no increase in sight
- Numerous issues with getting paid and finding someone who understands how to do any of it live or online.
- Most recently (today), they were upset and terse with me on the phone for simply asking for a copy of my W2 or instructions on how to get it online.

WORK
- Very demanding (Not for the pot-head slacker that they usually hire) 
- They did not understand time management or limitations based on simple factors like a truck being 4 hours late leading to late stocking

FACILITY
- Other than the 4-bulb fluorescent light fixture that was hanging from the ceiling by its wires after the ceiling got water logged, there are at least a dozen places with leaks throughout the store with buckets under them after rain or ice thaw
- The floor was redone during work hours throwing cement dust into the air and making so much noise you couldn't hear a cashier SCREAM how much your bill was.
- The bathrooms public & store employee only are always in completely unsanitary condition. Mostly since the store is a homeless-wino magnet, (No exaggeration here, meth heads shoot up in the bathroom, drunks pass-out in the entryway, just ask any employee)

Management
- All but the store manager are completely incompetent, condescending, rude and have one of 2 extremes, complete introverted social akwardness, or megalomania (lucky for the God complex ones, the ""Trump nation"" may allow them to excel)

SAFETY
- Again, the electrical and ceiling issues (controlled y the landlord), are an ever present problem
- Homeless and just regular thief types are always with you, especially fun at 3 AM
- Not only are the bathrooms unsanitary, but stock on the shelves may sit behind fresher stop in front for YEARS, and when a cooler/freezer breaks the remedy is questionable at best
- Lets not forget that your vehicle WILL be broken into and or hit by another vehicle (Sometimes the very delivery truck you will be un-stocking) because the lot is small, has steep inclines and little room for maneuvering 
- If you are green and choose to ride a bike, it too will be stolen or vandalized if too difficult to steal by the meth heads
Advice to Management
CLOSE THIS LOCATION!!!

- Open a new facility under YOUR control not a commercial slumlord
- Fire EVERYONE, make them re-apply to get their job back and the SCREEN THE HELL OUT OF THEM, turning down the addicts, criminal, violently mentally ill or sociopaths. I know if sounds scary BUT IT WORKS. There are plenty of other companies in town that run background checks on their employees. I know it's hard to find someone in MIssoula who isn't currently smoking pot (1 test at the beginning of employment doesn't stop that), I'm just saying weed out those who cannot perform their work duties because of substance use.

- You might actually be able to increase pay with a new facility that deters rather than encourages criminal behavior (including from within).

","The manager I had in the bakery cussed at me because he didn’t like how a box was opened. I felt like I constantly had someone breathing down my neck. Felt it was a negative atmosphere to be in. I could tell people would whisper and glare at me from a distance knowing they were talking about me. I know the respectful thing to do is give at least 2 weeks notice. After I got cussed at I finished my shift that day and never went back to work there after that. Not too long after I decided to leave that Albertson’s closed down and either the employees had to find new work or transfer to a Safeway or other Albertson’s location. I ended up finding a company that treats me with respect and I helped my boss/team get the highest customer satisfaction ratings in the company. 

It bummed me out with my experience working there because I had always enjoyed shopping at Albertson’s. 

I originally just wanted to be a cashier part time. Got asked to be put into the bakery instead.
Advice to Management
Have whoever is the manager of the specific department present throughout the whole interview, since they are the ones we will be working with most closely. If I would have interviewed with the bakery manager from the beginning I probably would have turned the offer down if I would have known more what I was getting into.

Tue Oct 17 2017, Baker,"Ashland, OR",Former Employee ,Baker,1,"The bakery manager was clearly working hard and doing her best with a bad situation; the other folks in bakery were fun to work with in that commiserating colleagues kind of way.

I took this job to get better at baking. While it did nothing for my mixing and prepping skills or any basic knowledge, it did improve my timekeeping skills.

The pay was just above minimum wage for Oregon (9.89/hr I believe, vs. 9.75/hr). I did not stay long enough to find out what the union benefits were or if the job came with any health or retirement benefits (I highly doubt it).

On the plus side, after this job, I know which grocery chains I do not wish to support as a customer, given the quality of their goods and how they treat their employees.
","Being a bakery, the hours are brutal. First week there, I was assigned the 3am-12pm shift, with an hour ""lunch"" break in the middle. This was commercial, not from-scratch baking: everything came in pre-mixed and frozen, and the bakers only opened packages and put items in the oven. (If you were lucky, you got to decorate some.) I was told they get a lot of turnover from employees who thought it would be a scratch-baking job; if they actually cared about reducing turnover, you'd think they'd mention it in the interview.

This is not a job about mixing and baking: it is about timing and packaging.

Constantly understaffed and overburdened, running on old and faulty equipment, we still had to be working at top speed and quality to achieve even the basic expectations on the floor. The store gives great weight to the few customer reviews that they get, and with few exceptions, upper management does not take into account other issues (e.g. understaffing and faulty equipment) that lead to, for instance, donuts coming out late or not being decorated nicely enough. On that note, upper management is very disconnected from on-the-floor employees, and it seems they have little sympathy for how hard these lower-grade jobs actually are.

I took this supposedly part-time job to make ends meet while searching for work in my actual field. I was given full-time hours, had to purchase my own uniform, had great difficulty getting my paycheck, and by noon everyday, I was left too exhausted to do anything else with my time. The pay was far, far too low to justify the toll on my health and time.

Everyone I met there, in and out of bakery (with the possible exception of store management and HR), seemed stressed and depressed. The people who work these jobs are the ones who have to; this company seems to take advantage especially of middle-aged workers and single mothers, people who can't afford to quit and look for other work because they are being paid so little in the first place.

The break room was dreary, covered in Safeway/Albertson's advertisements, and smelled like mold. The branded radio station was mind-numbing, and by the end of 3 days, I had the painfully chipper Safeway/Albertson's ads memorized. The dress code was demeaning, restrictive, and expensive... they only recently, ""generously"" allowed men to have long hair and beards. (Keep in mind, Ashland is a college town full of hippies; long hair, piercings, and unusual tatoos are practically staples of the culture.)

The best part of my day was taking my lunch outside to watch the sun rise.
Advice to Management
Pay your employees more and actually recognize their importance in keeping the company running -- that is, if you care about having enough staff to do the job well and care to decrease turnover. (The corporate levels don't seem to care that much, though.)

In the '70s, my aunt earned $15/hr doing an entry-level night shift at UPS. I think a giant corporation like Albertsons'/Safeway/Cerberus can easily afford to pay its overworked staff more than $9.89/hr.

","The Albertsons management is truly awful.
They focus on product distribution more than sales - the stores suffer from poor management & awkward direction from the corporate structure, an affliction shared by most of the supply chain.
Decisions are made from the ivory tower without input from the parties involved - for example, product is moved to and from the DC without interest or understanding on even the basic concepts of the warehouses (is there capacity? Is it price-effective?).
Decisions are made without giving enough advanced warning to affected parties.
Decisions are jerky and uncoordinated, causing incredibly excessive costs and failures on a regular basis.
Decisions are made without regard to people, and that goes from the floor, to management, and right on through to the customer. 
Compensation is crap!!! Salary for supervisors is less than what the hourly folks bring home. Benefits aren't even half of what the hourly folks bring home - it's the cheapest plan legally available. No matching on 401k. Pathetic pension. Add 50 hour workweeks and you've got a pretty depressing package.
Advice to Management
Drive responsibility down and trust your people. By ignoring your team you only alienate the people who could bring you success. Happy employees will work harder and smarter for you, but you are just running people into the ground to make-up for being short-handed.

Speaking of happy employees - stop treating salaried positions as slaves.
Read more in the ""Cons"" section. There is nothing you haven't cheaped out on here - even the 2 weeks of sick pay per year is a crock - give me a benefit I can use without lying for goodness sake. 2 weeks vacation until 7 years with the company?? Crazy.

Start focusing on the customer - you are tripping over gold dollars to pick up pennies. For example: who made the decision to take out the self check-out stands? We've lost countless customers to severe delays at the checkout lines on a constant basis. A good deal isn't worth 30 mins to check out.

Move into the 21st century already! Why are we living on tech from the 70's & 80's? Excel is not going to solve our problems!!
