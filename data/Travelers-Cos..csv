Tue Jan 26 2021, Director,"Saint Paul, MN",Current Employee ,Great Place to Work,1,"Travelers is a company that genuinely cares about the well-being of its employees. I've worked for several different employers in both the public and private sectors, and working at Travelers has been the best experience by far. Certainly no job experience is perfect, but this is pretty close. I can't imagine working anywhere else and at this point I plan on working here until retirement.
","Broadly speaking management is great, but I've seen several instances in lower level management where the most qualified, professional candidate is passed over for someone less professional and less qualified, which is very frustrating. There are power struggles and politics are definitely at play in those first and second tier management level positions, at least as I've observed. But again, by the time you get to the upper management level, for the most part it's great people that truly do care.
Advice to Management
Regular, anonymous 360 reviews of managers by their direct reports would help weed out those ""bad"" managers who are ineffective, under-qualified, and are the ones driving turnover.

Thu Jan 28 2021, Associate Technology Engineer,"Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,Life Under the Umbrella,0,"I never imagined I would be working at an insurance company after completing my undergrad. I've been with Travelers about 2 years now. The company of course puts their customers first but to make that happen they put even more time and effort into their employees. This is reflective of how long many employees have been with the company. It's not uncommon to hear from multiple people that they've been with Travelers for 2-3 decades, or they left and came back, or that multiple family members work for the company. They do a lot for their employees and it's created a great culture and work-life balance. The pay is very generous and bonuses reflect your initiative and effort. All of my managers have been incredibly supportive and have helped me grow. They are super flexible with the things that come up in life. The benefits are great especially for young people out of college (100% match in your 401k, a pension plan, and student loan 401k matching). There's also a lot of opportunity to move into leadership roles. Overall a great company to work for.
","Honestly there isn't much I can say. I wish there was more of an emphasis on higher educationvfor employees. They do pay for higher education but it's not necessarily encouraged or talked about. The overall program is pretty standard. There are other companies with better higher ed programs in that regard. With the wide range of technology we incorporate in Travelers as an engineer there can be a lot of hoops to jump through for things. But it makes sense too. There's a lot of moving pieces to manage.

Hard work and customer service is recognized by leadership. Always had a ""team"" feeling when working together even during the tough and busy times, we were all in it together.
","Claim volume has been high due to the numerous CAT events. CAT deployments are often lacking in numbers which provides only a short-lived break from local CAT claims. The Pay band is hidden, you will have a pay band classification with no scale to know if you are at the bottom, middle or top of the band. The bonus structure is hidden and not clear cut like other employers (The company does great, you work hard, perform well, and hope your manager comes back with a bonus for you). The 401k match is decent however, they match it once per year in bulk, some competitors do match per check/contribution. 
Even with the claim volume and feeling swamped at times, management does listen to you and likely feels the same as you do. I do have the feeling that this is not going unnoticed and management is doing everything in their power to help increase staffing and find other ways to manage claim volume.
Advice to Management
Keep the team environment going as it goes a long way.
Don't lose sight of how far positive recognition goes.
Increase the CAT and local staffing as CAT frequency/severity is increasing. If there is down time, local support or CAT support could be used to help with virtual inspections or holdbacks and supplements. 
If CAT staffing and local staffing can not be increased, hiring a handful of local employees that can handle all holdback and supplements would be a great help to allow the local staff to handle the increased volume and provide better customer service for quicker turnaround time.

While no company is perfect, Travelers is better than everywhere else I have worked. The CEO and senior leadership push for a culture where we care about our customers and each other. They are very serious about diversity and innovation. Many of the employees end up working here for decades before they retire. The pay and benefits are competitive and managers are encouraged to be empathetic and provide work -life balance to their employees.
","Not all the managers agree with senior leadership so there are some pockets of resistance and doing things the old school way by focusing only on productivity to the detriment of engagement and development of their reports. There are layoffs from time to time as the business changes or efficiencies are gained.
Advice to Management
Focus on developing managers who lack soft skills and are not driving engagement, and where necessary, replace them with managers that can balance productivity with engagement. Focus on broadening employee skills or cross-training employees and remove obstacles to employees moving between business groups.

Advice to Management
Allow employees to spend more time doing the job we love and less time forcing employees to adhere to numbers that look good on reports that they submit but don't reflect reality. Employees have no choice but to find ways to manipulate the system, phones and numbers and even their work quality to meet the numbers. If you dont meet the numbers you will be shamed and harshly reprimanded no matter how hard you work. PLEASE allow overtime or go to salary. Everyone knows we are working off the clock but no one wants to say anything about it.

There's a reason why most employees have been there for a decade or more. You'll stay employed as long as you keep your head down, don't make waves, and stay in your lane.
","Don't expect to be happy if you're passionate about what you do or have professional experience outside of insurance. You'll be suppressed in an environment that is resistant to transparency and self-awareness. 

Too many leaders are disturbingly disconnected. Managing up comes at the expense of managing teams, or keeping abreast of what's going on outside of the company's walls. That's common in organizations that don't value clear priorities and skilled management. It translates into an inordinate amount of time spent in meetings just to determine who is doing what. 

I've never seen a Travelers executive leave to join a company outside of insurance. Most of the leaders I've worked with wouldn't survive elsewhere, and that insecurity makes them sensitive to anything that calls their judgement into question.

My advice is really to the shareholders: shake up the board. No one on the board has led a technology or consumer product company. That's disturbing and reflects on the lack of focus on the quality of technology and marketing decisions. The stock has languished for too long.

Advice to Management
Raises may a good strategy to retain talent, but so is career advancement. The company has a good strategy for giving employee raises but not for career advancement. Employees can get stuck many years in the same job title although they are doing well by meeting expectations and receiving raises. The company appears to have a poor understanding of human psychology with regard to progress. If people feel they are not going somewhere upwards they will sick out other opportunities regardless of how much will pay them. This may not be true for everyone, but between myself and near 10 people I had the opportunity to speak before they left, it was one of the key reasons.

The company puts a lot of money into training and ensures that adjusters are well prepared and equipped with the knowledge to successfully perform their jobs. Most managers are extremely helpful and go out of their way to provide assistance and answer questions. 

CAT adjusters often work very long hours and can be away from home for up to 28 days at a time. Travelers does a good job at stressing the travel requirements during the interview process. 

The benefits are excellent. Getting 30 days of PTO right off the bat is unheard of. Additionally, Travelers offers a 401k match and pension plan.

Note - If they are short staffed, which they often are due to turn over, you can negotiate better pay. Makes it easier to stomach the micromanagement.
","Management plays favorites, always younger employees. Favorites are given all opportunities, best if not all bonuses, and given preference on newer equipment, desk location, better work from home opportunities and time off requests. 

Management ask for feedback and opinions but beware if you offer honest feedback or opinions. You will be an outcast if management feels you are not walking lock step. 

No female managers in my team. This is the good old boy system. Don’t be fooled. Small business is managed by all white males. *However, if you are a female comfortable with flirting with your managers your existence is always better. 

Poor moral of employees because they are micromanaged at every turn. Micromanagement leads to minimal employee performance. Usually high turn over every year after bonus period. 

Bonuses are a joke. Even with the stock market performing at record highs and some of the best tax breaks for companies in U.S. history - always and excuse to not offer performance cash, pay increase or even stock options.

I can't think of anything else but haven't met the minimum
","Super elitist culture, especially for entry-level talent. 

Interns are brought in and made to think that this internship program operates like most other large companies, one full-time spot for every intern, and if they meet/exceed expectations, they'll go back to school with a job offer. What travelers does instead is bring in 2-3 interns for every 1 full time spot. Every summer they have a ""intern symposium"", flying all senior-class interns from around the country into Hartford for 2 days endless marketing pitches about why they should come work for Travelers, again, painting the fake picture that there are spots for all of them... tying back to the elitism, they claim to only want the best talent and recruit them hard, but don't deliver on the claims they make about the employee experience.

They use diversity as a prop. This summer there was a deaf intern working in one of the department and had him do an event where he was supposed to be giving some kind of talk, but the interpreter never showed up and everyone around him was just speaking on his behalf. Totally wanted to showboat the fact that they took this intern in only to basically humiliate him. 

Also the ""leadership"" name in all of their programs is SUPER misleading. VERY rarely do graduates of the programs make it above mid-level management, even 20-30 years down the line. 

This place is a technological joke. New(ish) CIO is gonna have a hell of a time turning this around.

Tue Aug 20 2019, Underwriter,"Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,"Great to Start, Gets Stale Later",19,"Good benefits, good PTO, etc. Great place to start a career, especially in the UPDP pipeline programs....specialty lines are particularly good and are known across the industry as some of the best. While trivial at face value, some of the newer initiatives (Dress for Your Day, etc) are actually nice perks. The customer centric ""value add"" model is nice to buy into vs just price and terms. Specialty lines are arguably the value leaders of their respective markets. 

BU management wants to win and drives hard to put initiatives in place to do so. It can be a lot, but there are lots of tools to bring to market to differentiate.
","Elephant in the room: TRV is known for the ""Travelers Discount"", paying employees up to 20% below market and brag about it in leadership meetings. BU leadership wonders why people leave yet will jawbone ceaselessly about ""employee engagement & retention"" while doing absolutely nothing differently or adjusting comp to close the gap. The running joke amongst the rank-and-file is the only way to make more is to leverage an offer from a competitor. 

The comp process is a joke and a black box nobody can figure out up to the Sr. VP level. It's been a ""tough comp year"" with ""the bonus pool is down"" for the last decade despite management locally and c-suite both telling employees how good of a job we're doing and how TRV earnings are good. The messaging is completely different public vs. mid-Feb and while management is blissfully ignorant of that fact the little people grumble amongst themselves. Nobody can figure out how to quantify how performance translates to bonus; the inputs are extremely fluffy and left to local management's discretion...asking management direct questions just gets platitudes and redirection. 

Each experienced person that leaves a BU is essentially replaced by a new hire trainee, fewer and fewer experienced people are remaining in specialty BUs and more and more relationships with customers and agents are held at the executive levels making lower level people administrators of the business which is disheartening. 

The company will say things like ""we have a great pipeline and good continuity"" but scramble when someone senior leaves and take MONTHS to fill a customer facing executive or management role, even for a planned retirement. Experienced people are told they're ""in the continuity plan"" but nothing happens when the position opens and the people who were told they were in line for the next step suddenly are not. Our own customers have shared at conferences how they pipeline and identify talent for management and TRV has taken zero from that.

The hiring process is atrocious and should be completely revamped. Entry level or experienced people both suffer the months-long delays, bureaucracy, ghosting, ""it's with HR I need to wait for them"" excuses. RVP and CUO level managers all hate the process; the stories of how screwed up things get are unbelievable for a company this big.
Advice to Management
Actually pay people the market rate and do more to keep high potential/good talent people. Reform the comp process so inputs are known and tie directly to year end. Reform the hiring process so it's less painful for everyone- manager and new employee alike. Appreciate the ""backbone"" experienced employees that keep the place running. 

Most importantly: Actually be honest with employees about where they stand and how they fit into the future.

Mon Aug 12 2019, Senior Technology Engineer,"Hartford, CT",Current Employee ,"Overall a good long-term, community-esque company, albeit still beholden to big corp norms",3,"If looking to settle long term in your career, Travelers is a stable place to work for. Salary and benefits are typical of what you'll find working in technology in the insurance industry in Hartford. Travelers prides itself on community (being part of a bigger family), finding talent and staying competitive by shifting to staying current with technology trends. 

Unique rotation programs to help young talent get acquainted with the company and fellow employees in different areas. This builds on that community foundation Travelers is known for. 

CEO is open and actively uses social media internally and externally to keep employees engaged and aware of company direction and happenings.

One of the rare few companies that has an auto-enrolled pension plan after a certain tenure working there although it's more supplemental to your 401k plan than as a sole independent retirement plan.
","Innovation can be tricky as the established and new talent mix in as a whole. Lines of Businesses overlap on technology responsibilities and policy, causing an even more complicated internal friction on strategic direction on either one. Recent senior management reorgs have only muddled the waters further. 

Traveler's senior leadership seems to be stuck in this quasi state of ""getting it"" and being at the whims of the ""status quo"", typical of large corps. This ""get it"" state helps bring in young talent, but once the ""status quo"" settles in on them, that same tech talent usually tends to head for greener pastures with more room to grow based on talent and results and more progressive pay/work-life/benefits/policy packages more tech companies are shifting towards. 

At the end of the day, Travelers is an insurance company, not a full blown technology company and fusing together a traditional industry and a progressive industry has it's challenges. If you keep that in mind, and you want a pretty secure, stable career, and you prefer a more mellow approach to career growth and are happy with more traditional policies, then Travelers is a solid place to hunker down for the long haul.
Advice to Management
Keeping younger talent will require a shift in more progressive directions and policies that will have to start from the top down. More and more technology companies are offering better pay/work-life/benefits packages as they shift towards hiring distributed talent. If Travelers wants to stay competitive in technology and keep the best around long term in order to stay ahead of other insurance companies, this shift will be necessary.

Mon Jul 01 2019, Technology Engineer,"Hartford, CT",Former Employee ,Great place for some and a not so great place for others - my two cents,6,"Without of doubt it would be the biggest company asset, the people that you work with. Depends on which Line of Business you happen to work for. Some lines of business really encourage innovation and want you to be creative and succeed no matter if you fail.

In spite of all its flaws, Travelers is a decent place to start a career for new and young employees seeking exposure to different areas of technology. However, there is a BUT (see below).
","My line of business and my area in particular reminded me of a high school click. If you didn't belong or follow the group then you were looked as an outsider in a sense. Too much upper management turnover (re-orgs, organizational shifts, so many changes in philosophies) and I felt they had unrealistic expectations but since they are our senior leadership, we would do everything in our power to fulfill their requests. Even when they left, we stayed behind to fix the broken pieces. Management is inconsistent. Some lines of business are vested in their employees' work life and encourage a positive balance. So, requesting flexible work arrangements is a simple process. BUT (again) not every line of business will work with you. Even though it is a good starting point for new and young employees, the pay rate and benefits are on the lower side compared to some of the other insurers in the area. Older employees (again in my line of business) are not given the proper respect that they have earned and teams get reduced and they get swamped with a lot more responsibilities than they already have. This makes is seem that they are being pushed out the door to get younger and cheaper talent. Remember, other companies will offer a more competitive salary and benefits package.
Advice to Management
Just because the CEO has great ideas and can talk a great game, doesn't mean that he says will trickle down equally to us, especially if it is not in the budget. Not all lines of businesses are created equal. This is especially true if you support applications and the company infrastructure and not actual insurance products that generate revenue. We're a cost that they try to decrease. Be consistent across the board with your policies. Flexible work arrangements should be equally available and any restrictions should be same regardless of lines of business. Take a good look at some of the managers because not all of them are great leaders and they were promoted over candidates with real leadership talent in addition their technical knowledge and business savvy. Finally, don't be blind to the number of employees who leave or retire because the joy of working at Travelers was sucked out of them.

","Where do I begin.... Travelers is incredibly stingy with everything except for upper management pay and bonuses. If you're a regular employee expect to receive the corporate spin every year when it comes time for your bonus, if you can even call it that. 

I could careless that the company returned hundreds of millions of dollars to our shareholders when I feel like the company needs to do a better job at taking care of their employees.

Everyone I know that works here is miserable, except for the new guys. The only reason why most of us are still here is that Travelers does a great job at making you feel like you don't matter and that your just a number to them and they find a way to suck the joy out of you so lack the desire to find something new because you lack the confidence in yourself and your abilities.

If Travelers is a top 100 Best Places to work, the bar must be terribly low because this place is horrible.

It seems like every department's goal is to see who can spend the least amount of money because the company dislikes spending money on everything.

Advice to Management
Upper management will nickel and dime auto appraisers on estimates BUT if the policyholder goes to the same church as someone in upper management, you must bend over backwards to address damage that would have not even been considered for coverage. That's not indemnification- other policyholders are paying for the ""New bill"" and extra costs associated with bending (breaking?) the rules. 

Every claim is different and should be handled on it's own merrits but personal relations with policyholders should not change the rules, regulations, and company policies that all other claims must abide by. 

Also, provide more training & development opportunities to your employees. Follow through with your commitments to do so. Be honest to potential employees when interviewing. People are not placeholders.

","The hiring process is very cumbersome and lack proper communication. If I judged this amazing company on their lack of organization with processing new hires, I would have never accepted a job here. 
I had to constantly call my hiring rep because I was not kept in the loop and when I called the background company they informed me that they had sent in their paperwork within two days of my signing papers. So I patiently waited. As days turned into weeks I finally reached out to my contact who still had not received word. It wasn't until I contacted another talent rep did I finally get my call that I was all set for first day. I was then told I would receive a final call the next week. Next week comes and goes still no call. Finally 4 days before I am to start I contacted my rep to confirm start dates and times. Evidently there was an email sent out that I never received but finally was sent 3 days before my start date.

Every day that I go to work I don't just feel like a cog in a machine, I actually feel as though I have worth and that the company does value me. 

- At Travelers you have frequent meetings with your Unit Manager which really assists in quick learning 

- Travelers utilizes quality scores just as most companies do now but they are not ever used to punish you, but only to reward you at the end of each quarter with bonuses based on your KPI's. Travelers also allows for reassurances which means that if you disagree with a quality score and have ample proof in the training material to backup your point, you can get your score changed.

- Overtraining. At first this might sound like a negative but really we were trained for the worst of the worst situations and I am yet to have one of these experiences but am thankful that I was trained to handle every situation and not rushed out. 

- Work from home opportunities. Currently I work full-time from home which is a huge benefit and Travelers is even starting to allow in-office workers to work a day from home each week or to work from home due to inclement weather. 

- Benefits and 401k. You'd expect to get great benefits from a company with 30k employees and you'd right. Travelers offers a great health insurance package as well as a more than healthy amount of vacation time. The 401k match at 5% is also fantastic and you can find discounts ranging from car rentals to hotel stays and discounts on buying new cars.

","If you divide the pay by how many hours you must work to stay off the 'lists', you're lucky to be making minimum wage. Upper management aka 2VPs and up are only concerned with numbers/metrics. If ever you tell them no to extra duties or getting deployed, they will stop at nothing to make your life miserable until you quit. Doesn't matter if you have young kids, if it is your month to deploy (and it's mandatory that you sign up once a quarter to deploy), you will only get 24 hour notice to be wherever they need you to deploy to for 2 weeks minimum. Also, if you are signed up for a particular month and it is the last day of the month, you are still deployable. So instead of being deployable 4 months out of the year, it's actually 8 months which makes vacations very challenging.

","Office redesign to open concept with tiny desks and no privacy - right at a time when multiple studies from Harvard and others are showing that this lowers productivity. 

26 pay periods makes no sense for exempt salary employees, forces you to budget two extra paychecks per year rather than just enjoying your salary twice a month on a 24-pay system. 

Basically no perks or office amenities you would find at a competing multi-billion dollar carrier. No gym, no snacks, no coffee, employees have to pool their own funds just to buy a keurig. No employee appreciation events, no outings, employees had to bring all food for holiday parties - no sponsorship from management. Minimal work anniversary recognition. Not much attempt to make you feel like a part of a team or family.

There are some great people that work at Travelers, however there is a strong ego from senior management - almost a sense of “you’re lucky to be working here”, apparently unaware that there is stiff competition for experienced commercial insurance professionals. Recruiters call multiple times per month. 

Essentially, you can work your butt off, have a great production year and find yourself wondering if anyone noticed.

I have been working at Travelers full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Work life balance is supported and encouraged, very stable company, and I have found people to be enjoyable to work with for the most part.
Cons
Offices are nothing special, no frills such as free coffee or an employee lounge, and bonuses are not incredible even when you are a top performer.
Advice to Management
Pay attention to local dynamics. The overall company strategy is a winning one, but we have lost a decent amount of people in my field office (in my opinion) due to a more one-size-fits-all home office approach which has left some folks feeling like they need to leave to further their careers/incomes.

Coworkers were good people
","I left this company more than 2 years ago and I still can't get over how it all went down. I'm going to gloss over what most people would consider more important aspects like cramped cubicles, micromanagement and a job that was totally different than what was described (but looking back maybe I didn't ask the right questions). 

First thing I noticed when starting in this office is there were 2 toilets in the men's bathroom for the entire floor. God forbid you cut it close on the day someone brought in free k-cups, you'd have to try one of the other 2 floors to find an open bathroom. Then when you get back to you desk you gotta explain to your manager why you've been gone 10 minutes.

Another day the company decided it would be real moral booster to make a parody of Macklemore's Downtown music video in the office and the guy from accounting who was tasked with shooting the video on his iphone turns into Spielberg. There are 3 elevators in this shared building and this guy's gotta commandeer one to get the perfect shot of some people lip syncing in it. 

Finally, and this is the thorn that I cannot shake. At some point in my employment, the company handed out some swag and this included a Traveler's branded coffee cup. After I gave my 2 weeks notice, cause I think I'm a considerate guy, I was phoned in the coming days and told not to come in. They first told me they would mail my stuff to me, but they agreed to let me come to the lobby and they would hand me my boxed up knick knacks. Guess what wasn't in that box? That's right. It wasn't even a good cup, but this is a breech of common courtesy (have some of that insurance jargon).

Wed Sep 19 2018, Medical Case Manager,"Portland, OR",Current Employee ,Best company I ever worked for,1,"I feel supported by my leadership, they genuinely care about my success. Expectations are clearly outlined and leadership helps to give you the tools to reach those expectations - there are no surprises. The onboarding was amazing, the most thorough I've had in any job I've held. Work/life balance is fantastic. They have recently begun to allow workforce to work from home up to 3 days per week and 2 days in office with desk-share; this is one of the best perks by far. And when you do come to the office you get to wear jeans! Great benefits: health, dental, vision, 401K, stock options, bonuses to those who earn it, great competitive wages, reimbursement for classes to further your career goals. The working atmosphere is supportive, leadership is consistent. The work can be demanding, but it's all about organizing your own workflow. Coworkers are friendly, welcoming and willing to help. The company celebrates diversity and cultural inclusion. It's okay to be out at work and talk about your husband/wife/partner and share your life with others. Several speakers are booked per year to speak about diversity topics, the events are meaningful and thought provoking. Locally we do a lot of community outreach work. Travelers offers a matching program that can help infuse dollars into a 501c3 of your choice through matching donations or with donating your time. Communication is open and encouraged, open door policy with all leadership including local VP.

I work as a nurse for the company. I don't have direct patient contact which I prefer. In my role I have no risks for physical injury to my own body, no risks to my license and I enjoy working a set schedule with the ability to plan vacations. I always have weekends off. 3 weeks paid vacation to start with all major holidays off including the day after Thanksgiving.

Plus I like that we are a financially conservative company that doesn't need gimmicks to keep our name hot. We have a solid past and we continue to have a solid future with the smart choices brought forth by senior leadership.

Training here is great. The UPDP program in particular is excellent. Always very underwriting-focused.

The office environment itself is very pleasant. The building is very nicely maintained and always looks professional. There is always consistent building upkeep and maintenance going on (not a bad thing!) Free and easy parking is great.

Travelers provides a lot of time off work, which is great (however leadership has recently put forth new sales call requirements which somewhat negate this benefit, as you now have to make up sales visits you ""missed"" during your paid time off)
","Even when things are going well, leadership will find something to be unhappy with. 

My leader was new. Her leader was new. That leader's leader was new. In fact, all the way up to CEO, the leadership at Travelers is pretty much all new. I wish that was a ""pro,"" but is isn't. At all levels, leadership is probably best described as overwhelmed, scared, and dangerous. 

Bonuses and raises -- even for top performers -- isn't great. Top performing non-leadership can anticipate an annual bonus of ~10-20% of base pay. There are no quarterly bonuses. How they determine raises and bonuses is completely arbitrary and all bonuses are given in total secrecy. There is no transparency or a printed bonus plan.

Quit outsourcing all non-phone jobs overseas, please. The quality just isn't there and it is starting to show.

Come out of your offices and chat with employees on the floor occasionally (and not just the favored one or two brown-nosers.) Develop some respect for your employees, because they aren't feeling the love right now (and haven't been for awhile.)

Where does all the money go? Seriously. This company makes a lot, and the pay here isn't great (don't expect big raises after you get hired.) Start paying a quarterly bonus to your employees who make goal... and quit making ""goal"" mean a mathematical formula of twenty different things that change every year.

- Some of the people are really nice. 
- Having the company's name on your resume can help open doors within the industry.
","Everything else. You'll see a lot of great reviews from first year employees, and there's a reason for that. 

Travelers has an unspoken ""up or out"" policy. I've been told this by VERY reliable sources. So while they strive to keep new hires happy for their first year there, afterwards the rug gets pulled out from under everyone. Among tenured employees, they're seeking to promote the top 20% or so, who are mostly selected based on how popular they are among the management team. The other 80% or so of new hires will be driven out of the company. 

No one believes it'll happen to them until it does. Speaking out about these things can cause a person to get labelled a disgruntled employee by others, at least until the machine goes into effect against those others also and they experience what's going on for themselves. So if you were wondering why turnover is so high there, the cat is out of the bag. 

If you get an opportunity to work at Travelers take advantage of it, but have an exit-plan ready upfront. The company will use you then spit you out, so don't get caught worrying about loyalty. Just use them for what they're good for -- the pay, the benefits, and the experience. But look out for yourself first and foremost. Treat your relationship with the company the way they treat it: strictly business.
Advice to Management
One of the drawbacks of being a well-established and very successful company is it can blind leadership to their own mistakes. Travelers does some things very well, but stop allowing that to be an excuse for all the things you clearly do wrong. Stop being so stubborn and slow about adopting or implementing more efficient tools and technologies, or about reforming the processes that are clearly broken. There's a pattern of major overhauls not being implemented until several years AFTER front-line employees make it extremely clear changes are necessary.

","Not much work/life flexibility and pretends to hire experts but hires a lot of referred candidates. There were some knowledgeable staff who were previously law enforcement, skilled trade and veterans which is great for the investigation role, however they hired SEVERAL former Enterprise employees, which if you read their customer reviews, has less than stellar employees. These are new college grads without any actual knowledge of the insurance industry or simply mechanical knowledge, but just sales people, not very successful ones at that. The majority of employees I encounter don't understand how property and casualty works, what the difference is between an agent, broker and insurer, which is important when filing a first notice of loss. I was hired for an operations specialist role, which is a basic clerical role with not much opportunity for advancement and VERY mundane work. If your happy doing the bare minimum, and not being mentally stimulated, it's the place to be with competitive pay for doing virtually nothing, but if you want a challenge or opportunities, it's definitely not the place for you, at least not an operations specialist role. In addition to this, even if you apply for a different position internally, unless there are opening at your current location or you work at the corporate office in CT, don't expect to get any opportunities at other locations, having interviewed with a few different positions at different locations, they're very hesitant to hire anyone that may need to relocate, so if you're looking to move up, you're pigeon holed into only being able to move up in the same division in which you were hired, and there's very few advancement opportunities. Another weird and somewhat minimal inconvenience, but I had never encountered at any other employee, yet ran into it multiple times at Travelers, is that when mass emails go out, many employees make the mistake of hitting ""reply all"" which creates a chain reaction, so when you send an email to 10,000 employees and someone hits ""reply all,"" expect to spend the day deleting hundreds and hundreds of emails because people will continuously hit ""reply all"" just to tell everyone else ""please stop hitting reply all."" No work/life balance in claims, even if you're not tied to a phone or have an inventory, you're still mostly likely not going to have a work from home option or a flexible schedule option so you'll be in the office 8-5 all week. No bonuses, even claims employees held to a financial goal, you'll just get a free lunch for meeting it, not much incentive to go above and beyond. Overall, the subrogation departments are simply glorified call centers. Also, the company is frequently has lay offs and downsizing, no one is exempt from this, underwriting, claims, management, support, etc.
Advice to Management
Respect employees needs and be empathetic if you want a more productive workfoce.

I know an employee who was laid off after 35 years due to downsizing and her son was in a coma for months already prior to the lay off and she had to figure out what to do to continue the necessary care for her son. Why wouldn't you give preference over an employee who has had an impressive track record with the company, those are the people you want to retain. Educate your employees more on the insurance industry, you're enabling their tunnel vision by simply training them on their current role and relying on their previous experience to perform their job.

It's the solid companies like Chubb and Travelers that drive the marketplace, but let's not get carried away and greedy for the sake of temporary growth...it's cyclical, and the game hasn't changed in 200 years although automation has.

It's the solid companies like Chubb and Travelers that drive the marketplace, but let's not get carried away and greedy for the sake of temporary growth...it's cyclical, and the game hasn't changed in 200 years although automation has. And finally understand that you have some of our managers stretched so thin they may snap... A good company values Life Work Balance and sometimes I don't see that

","I worked in the corporate office St. Paul before the tower building was sold to Ecolab. Corporate employees are primarily split between Hartford (majority) and St. Paul (minority) due to a 2005 merger, and St. Paul isn't often viewed as an ""equal"". Career progression is a lot easier in Hartford, as a result.

If your goal is clear career development and you aren't part of one of the Leadership Development Programs (LDPs), it can be much more difficult to move around internally or gain certain leadership exposure, unless you're willing to move to Hartford.

As with many companies, many of the corporate directors & up have much less work-life balance, which is observable by individual contributors. While many do not necessarily impose those requirements on their direct reports, it's a known condition associated with moving up the organization.

Fri Nov 10 2017, Manager,"Hartford, CT",Former Employee ,Great Company to Work For!,1,"I started at Travelers right out of college on a technical / IT track. Over time, this evolved into various finance support, reporting, and data/analytics positions. The company has a lot of room for growth if you put in the effort. I was promoted 3 times in a series of 9 years. This varies by individual, but I did receive a bonus yearly, a merit increase yearly, and periodically received stock awards. This is a good company for those who like a ""cushy"" job with slow, steady, and consistent advancement and compensation. Travelers is very stable, well managed, and I never felt the stress of my job not being there tomorrow. The company has a positive reputation and very positive morale at the Hartford campus, with a very team oriented culture. It was a great place to start my career and I learned so much working there. I would recommend Travelers as one of the better places to work in the greater Hartford area. I also had never been micromanaged at all. Gossip and negativity are almost non-existent. (of course this varies department to department and role to role, so take it with a grain of salt).
","When it came to promotions and advancement in terms of title and compensation, it seemed at times that my extra work efforts to go above and beyond were only partially recognized. I did always receive positive feedback, but what seemed to matter more when it came time for a promotion was how long you had been in your current role and if you were ""due"" for a promotion, rather than what you delivered, even if you hit the ball out of the park repeatedly. Certain aspects of the company do feel a little ""old school"". It is a little too formal for the year 2017 - you can't even wear jeans on Friday! The company seems to be playing ""catch up"" to be a ""cool place to work"" compared to other companies, by recently renovating all of the floors and trying to be more flexible with things like remote working options. They are also somewhat cheap and conservative with small things that go a long way. For example, we had to pay for our own holiday party, rather than the company giving a budget to each dept. You also have to pay for parking (approx $1000/yr pretax) if you choose to drive to work. Last, this company is a tad management heavy. EVERYONE is a manager, director, etc. It almost devalues the prestige and desire to be promoted to a higher title, since the company gives out big fancy titles so liberally. All of these cons are highly out-weighed by the pros though, and I would still recommend working at Travelers.
Advice to Management
More recognition of what an individual contributes/delivers, versus how long they have been in a role when considering promotion opportunities.

Let people wear jeans on Fridays.

Mon Jun 26 2017, Account Manager,"Saint Paul, MN",Former Employee ,"Good Benefits, Extremely Boring Job",8,"The PTO is 22 days starting including sick days (this is what made me, and I believe others, stay longer than they normally would if contemplating finding another job) and about 9 paid holidays. 

Medical benefits (copay is somewhat high if you have a reason that requires you to see a doctor multiple times within one month on an Account Manager salary)

Stable and trusted company 

The IT ""systems"" employees are fast and efficient when you have a problem you just call the number and they usually know the remedy. 

Was given a sit stand desk (but it took months to receive because of red tape getting doctors note, custom order, etc.. I thought it would never come but one day it was there) this made me feel valued as an employee because they are expensive.

Flexible work schedule. You can typically start anytime between 7:00am and 9:00am as long as you come in consistently at the same time and work for 8.5 hours (includes 30 minute lunch, 9 hours if you take a one hour lunch). 

This job has a salary but you are an hourly employee. This is a great way to get overtime (if you had a salary you would not get overtime) but I almost always worked 40 hour weeks. Overtime is usually only granted if you have a large workload that needs attention. Some employees are notorious for coming in every now and then on Saturday's but you can get the job done in a 40 hour work week typically. Also, if you want to take a day off and use your PTO, even if it is the same week as you are asking, the manager usually approves this as long as you find someone to back you up for urgent items when you are out of the office. My department was really good at backing each other up when out of the office. 

Understanding of major life events, such as if a health crisis occurs, as long as you follow the required protocol. Following the protocol (especially of a disability health insurance company) as well as of your company can be overwhelming when you are going through a health or family crisis but it is also a huge relief to know that you have this insurance and work for a company that offers such a generous policy. I also met multiple people who have left Travelers for one reason or another and return to work for the company later in their career. 

Discounts for gyms, cell phone if you are the primary account holder, various music and theatre events (partial to large campus in St. Paul and Hartford I believe), hotels, etc..

Travelers choir group and other activity groups. Diversity clubs offer various thought- provoking and inspirational speakers as well as leadership opportunities. Gym on site but you have to pay for it. Massage therapist on site for pay.
","The Account Manager job is very repetitive and boring. You may be pulling the same report 25 + times per day for weeks on end while also needing to rate, quote, propose or issue different policies within your territory. Each account has multiple policies that all require different ways to rate, quote, propose and issue within different systems. Knowing every nuance for each type of policy within every system and website used to complete supplementary work, along with each state an account is located in has different nuances on top of this in multiple facets, can be very overwhelming. An extremely organized, concrete-linear thinking person is a good fit for this job but I am more on the creative abstract-thinking side and know this is why I was never able to fully engage or get into the work. 

All work is monitored through a ""transaction manager"" that you update; however the system can make errors or work can be transferred incorrectly (for example, ""service"" aka the workers in India that are gradually taking over Account Manager responsibilities are people that you transfer a task to complete may not complete the task in time and you have to keep checking to make sure it is completed or you are responsible when managers look at your ""numbers"" aka stats) and many employees keep track of their work through their own personal excel sheet because of the risk that the ""transaction manager"" does not list an account assigned to you. However, management does not want you to use additional tracking on your own excel sheet because ""transaction manager"" is so highly endorsed from the top. Your manager reviews your ""transaction manager"" scores and judges your work from this system but cannot say which account was late or backup the numbers. You can email your manager on why ""transaction manager"" made a mistake or if an insurance agent (client) was the reason for a specific late work but I do not really know the point of this. My manager must have received over 50 emails a day and how do they keep track of all of these emails from their subordinates when there are more pressing issues to deal with? Seemed semi-pointless to email an excuse for why ""transaction manager"" is wrong to me when the manager still takes your ""numbers"" as is. Also your ""year-to-date"" numbers can haunt you if you mess up and are hard to get back up so try to get all work in on time. I was not aware how important getting all work in on time was in the beginning of my time at Travelers because some well respected co-workers had a lot of red (aka late work) so I did not think it was very serious to have some late work. However, they had larger territories (aka more work that month). I wish that trainers and managers would emphasize how important on time work is in the beginning of your time at Travelers (and each trainer and manager is different, you may luck out and have a great one or a horrible one) instead of acting so relaxed or just simply not saying anything about this at all until it is too late to make yourself look good. Certain work needs to be completed a certain amount of days before a policy is renewed and this was not even communicated to me. Yikes, glad I finally figured it out. Sorry to write so much on this topic but ""transaction manager"" is a topic that many employees have issues with and hopefully the kinks will be worked out within the next few years. It takes awhile for changes due to red tape. 

There are so many differences between states (the state that each account is issued in has different requirements aka insurance forms added or removed manually or different tools to run that are input for renewal; and your territory includes multiple states for those out there not familiar with insurance) and computer systems that you must memorize and once you figure a system out they usually change it. 

You can't work from home but your boss can. A couple times my coworkers wrote that they were ""working from home"" on their status. They were obviously working from home to accommodate a doctors appointment, sick child, whatever it may be, but I was told that working from is never aloud from my boss. This made me feel very devalued as an employee because it is favoritism that was never addressed. I was lied to about it. Work accommodations are confidential but when it comes to working from home the entire department needs the same policy. Employees from other departments have also worked from home but each manager makes their own rules. However, do not expect to work from home at all if you are an Account Manager. Account Executives, aka Underwriters, have more freedom to work from home but they also have sales goals to meet and are not hourly employees. 

There is a separation between Account Managers, aka Underwriting Assistants, and Account Executives, aka Underwriters. Some Underwriters act like they are above the Account Managers who do SO much work for them. However, some Underwriters are great. Just be aware of this unprofessionalism at times. It can make you feel small if you make a mistake but we are all human and most of us all have the same four-year degrees (not that that even matters). 

I was told that there are advancement opportunities but if you decide that insurance is boring and dry or do not want to commit to a developmental program offered (the leadership program requires one year of living out of state for a rotation and takes four years to complete the program) you are kind of stuck as an Account Manager. It is unclear how to become a Senior Account Manager. There was only one in my department who had been there over 10 years. It seems very much up to the manager. I am also not sure how you would jump from Account Manager to unit manager. Seems unrealistic to me. 

Coworkers, peers and Underwriters, will watch your every move and report to your manager any slip ups. This may be a passive aggressive trait specific to Minnesota or may be just how corporate life is. This creates internal friction and a distrust within the workplace. 

Biggest con of all: was trained by a trainer from a different department with different procedures to complete work! This was only because my new manager was trying to create ""emersion"" between two departments that he managed. He did not work in business insurance at his previous role at Travelers and must not have understood that our departments were so different otherwise he would have understood he was setting my up for failure. This also may have happened because our department was understaffed and too busy to train or sometimes answer questions. 

Typical of any large business, but SMALL cubicles! When I first started they were on the small size but got reduced to an even smaller size (I believe 6x4 feet) after renovations. I would have to move my trash can almost into the aisle when I wanted use my desk as standing so there would be room for my chair to move backwards. Account Executives have slightly larger cubicles, and typically closer to windows. Managers have closed doors but typically in the middle of the floor with no windows to the outside. 

Never received a pay increase/bonus or even an annual inflation increase. This is never discussed. It would be an incentive to know what you could personally do in order to increase your chances of earning one. However, maybe you receive the same pay forever. I will never know.
Advice to Management
If managers that managed Account Managers knew more about the Account Manager role, and I am sure some do but mine did not because he had no experience in Business Insurance, this would create more understanding and achievable goals between management and subordinates. 

If there is an issue with your manager it is unclear who to discuss it with. The managers have a lot of power but we can all improve. If your manager does not respond to your emails repeatedly it is okay but if you don't comply with something it is not okay? It should be a two way street and there needs to be a checks and balances system for managers so they can improve and ensure that employees are being valued. 

Understand how ""transaction manager"" works and communicate how important it is to get all work completed by specific dates for each task instead of saying nothing until it is time to review numbers. 

Everyone is gone for a different time for lunch. Many people say they do not take their 15 minute break in the morning and afternoon and instead take an hour for lunch and clock it as gone for 30 minutes. Some people eat lunch at their desk (I am guessing they clock the 30 minutes gone and actually work that time because it is state law to take this break). This is more of just an FYI and grey area. 

Do not interview someone in your halloween costume, even if it is halloween. My manager did this and I would have been offended or unable to concentrate if I was the interviewee. 

If an employee is out on medical leave and emails an update, email them back promptly. As Account Managers we are expected to act with urgency and the employee may feel their job is in jeopardy when the boss doesn't respond for days, when in actuality he just is bad at prioritizing emails. 

Find a way to provide free coffee to employees in the break rooms. This would be easy and many would appreciate this instead of spending money at the company Starbucks. It would also save time.

- Growth within the company

Cons
Office politics. Nepotism. Toxic work environment at some locations. Inability to recognize/develop talent. Rigid mindset. Poor compensation compared to competitors. Infrequent and unimpressive bonus structure. No formal training/internal education for sales personnel. No clear organizational structure with respects to one role/department transitioning to another discipline. For as big an international company as we are, we have a painful lack of opportunities/upward mobility. Lack of strategic tools to grow book (lower agent commission compared to some competitors, rarely offer incentives like gift cards/rewards, cheap with swag, product priced high compared to market, conservative appetite compared to competition, convoluted and tedious approach to underwriting.)
Advice to Management
Stop punishing creativity/ideas. Transition from old IBM 1980s approach to business. Learn to harness thought diversity, not simply focus on ethnicity/gender. Understand that generous employee compensation is a form of investment, with potential to yield much bigger dividends (better morale, less resentment and real teamwork.) Change philosophy to turning a profit ""with"" employees vs. at their expense. Listen when your talent pool messages the same concerns year after year and do something about it.

- Low salary ceiling once you hit a certain level
- Well behind the curve on technology compared to competitors 
- Rating and Ranking system deeply flawed; huge popularity contest and way too much emphasis placed on how many and what extracurricular activities each employee is doing, rather than their technical ability
- Not as flexible with employees as a lot of competitors have become. No work from home days for all employees but at least starting a pilot to explore it.

Wed Jan 11 2017, Claims Representative,"Charlotte, NC",Current Employee ,Decent workplace; little value placed on employees,5,"Travelers can be a great place to be if you don't mind a tremendous amount of politics. As with other companies, there are certain people ""on the fast track"" for promotion, often undeserving of it. If you get in with the right group, you're golden. The pay is above-average but this is because the work load is extremely unrealistic.
","In theory the training program is great but the new employees don't get to take advantage of a full program due to the workload. Recently, some new hires received claims their very first day with the company! Travelers has unrealistic expectations on workload and Senior management has no clue what working the desk is really like as they so far removed from daily activity. In reality, working one claim, up to Travelers' standards, could take the better part of a full workday, so imagine getting multiple claims per day, which is what happens. Senior management does not value the unit managers. Great demands are placed on them, and even more on their time. The managers are always in a meeting, or taken away from their desks and when they are there, get bombarded with employee questions. It is not uncommon for the unit managers to work until 11pm or later each evening, and the weekends. There simply is no work-life balance if you want to succeed here. Lastly, upper management does not support unit managers when dealing with other employee issues. All employees are terrified of the claim center VP as well.
Advice to Management
Value your unit managers, and take their side every now and then, instead of always believing the other side. Don't roll over all the time when customers complain as this really makes it look like the unit managers have no authority; take the time to discuss a concern and believe your own employees when you have nothing to show that the employee is wrong. Senior management should regularly sit with employees to see what the daily activities are really like and maybe they would understand the expectations and demands are unrealistic. Don't schedule 5 meetings a month which take the managers away from their desks for half a day or more, leaving them no time for their employees or own work.

Pay more attention to your department and its productivity instead of being in meetings with each other all day to accomplish nothing except to plan your next meeting.

In 36 years of being in insurance Loss Control, this was the WORST company I have ever worked for!! I would not recommend working for this company.

Thu Dec 29 2016, Business Analyst,"Hartford, CT",Former Employee ,Laid off after 20 years,4,"Travelers is a large company so there is a lot of opportunity for learning new things. In theory, that means a lot of opportunity to move around and up within the company. Some very smart people work at Travelers, and many of them are willing to help you understand and learn.
","Unless you went through one of the management training tracks straight out of college, it is difficult to move up significantly. Senior leadership makes WAY more money than mid-level and lower employees. Knowing that the highly paid people make bonuses off of lower echelon's hard work is irksome. Bonuses for 'regular' employees are reserved for the few top performers at each level.
Advice to Management
Offer more training tracks for people to learn and improve skills to encourage growth. Make it easier for people to earn their CPCU, ARM and other professional designations. Reinstate the practice of paying UConn tuition for an employee to earn their MBA, instead of reimbursing employees after the fact.
