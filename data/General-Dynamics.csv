","Upper Management promoted by the "" Hey Buddy Club""

Employees that are good at their job are held back unable to advance.

Middle Management ignored and brushed aside until BIG Issues come to light.

Computer based training is practically useless, not department specific and waste of time. 

Upper Management PREFERS to have morale LOW, apparently happy employees are bad employees.

Quality Control is forced to be more Production oriented than Quality oriented.

Company brings in more and more "" Contractors "" instead of allowing incoming workforce to actually gain experience. And also at a much higher pay that not only takes money away from a family, but also TAKES EXPERIENCE AWAY FROM THE NEW INCOMING WORKFORCE. That is a major issue.

Overloaded with unnecessary paperwork that takes time and concentration away from doing the actual job.

","I'll give two stars since I cant speak for the entire company but if you are contacted for an IT position you are better off applying elsewhere. First, you are hired through a staffing agency Insight Global who does not offer you much gain either so you already lose some pay, and GD never does contract to hire there was someone here for almost a decade and they left due to never being offered a full job. Once you realize that the entire building is full of old hand me down equipment that breaks daily(seriously the printer you have to use is even 8 years old) mixed with a low pay and the fact you will always be a contractor and never hired on full time and then finally you'll then realize you don't have the best management. Some in mangement simply don't understand technology in fact there were often times I completely skipped asking my boss and went to my coworker for a better answer on how to do something. This boss has had 7 techs in about 15 months(next person hired will be the 8th) when previously this building had the same two techs for almost a decade! There's just better work/life jobs out there better. With this one you'll eventually find yourself stressed just trying to keep the building from falling apart.

Fri Nov 09 2018, Investigator,,Current Employee ,"Job could easier, smoother, and better",0,"The flexibility is the highlight of this job. You set your own eight hour work day schedule.

Benefits are great too and we get federal holidays off. 

Reaching out for help has never been an issue. There are resources for HR support to general work support.
","It’s obvious the job requires more than a few weeks of online training. To really understand this job, there needs to be 5-6 months of training. By the time training is completed, investigator’s should know at the very least how to write a clear and concise report considering that is a major component to the job. Unfortunately, the lack of extensive training creates this repetitive cycle where new investigators are brought on the contract, collectively screw up, it falls down on the supervisors who then tell their respective teams everything that they are doing wrong, and then the cycle repeats. It can’t be that over 200+ people are just not getting the job. How the job is taught needs to be deconstructed, re-evaluated, and crafted into something that actually creates background investigators. 

Investigator’s are contractually obligated to travel up to 100 miles for case work. The appeal of this job was doing as much local work as possible and working from home. It’s discouraging to drive out of your area only to return with no results because it’s a waste of time. You will get reimbursed, though it’s still not ideal or productive compared to how much work you could be doing in your local area. If this job appealed to you because you wanted to work from home and lessen your commute, think again. 

The pay is not worth the amount of stress this job will cause you. This is a job where you’ll wear different hats, feel the stress of wearing those hats, and get paid as though you only wear one.

","Highly insular culture that generally promotes to senior leadership levels those who have been with the company for decades. Does not welcome or encourage views from late-comers to the company.

Advice to Management
If you want your company/corporation to quit falling behind your competitors, quit deluding yourselves that your career talent will keep pace. You need aggressive thinkers and doers, not just sycophants who nod their head to make you feel good about the direction where you're headed. Start promoting employees who have not been with the company for decades, otherwise you'll continue to lose new entrants who quickly realize there's no future to be a senior leader with GD. Finally, your business model is not that complicated, so quit using that as an excuse for why only long-in-the-tooth GD employees can run your P&L and business functions.

","Where do I begin ? Training was given by two call center volunteers. It would’ve just been better to learn alone in a quiet room with the online tutoring programs. Once training is completed you will be reviewed by an experienced call center agent who will then tell you that none of you have been trained. You will be introduced to your telephone system during your first call when you’re in the nesting pod and will be promptly abandoned. During nesting you will play musical very old and falling apart chairs and move multiple times to several broken computers and or monitors. During an interview recently I was told that they did get some new computers. Caveat, after being told that there is new management in place it appears that is not the case I therefore opted not to accept a second attempt to work for this company. Upper management who is not familiar with their own dress code will attempt to tell you that your shoes do not meet the standard when in fact they do. Unfriendly and unwelcoming more experienced peers will not assist you gladly and it is at that time you will learn there is not one right way to move through your scripts. The next calls that you stumble through with out any available assistance will teach you that more incorrect information has been collected for those who should not be eligible to receive federal government money for healthcare. This will leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling about the high federal taxes you are paying while working in this job . Your positive attitude and professional demeanor will quickly be destroyed. It appears as though the employees that acclimate to this environment will face a barrage of Gossip and comfortably become a drone. You will meet some pleasant fellow employees who are also looking elsewhere. But they are few.

You are paid on every federally recognized holiday time and a half if you are scheduled to work, even if we are closed for the day. Especially during the slower seasons there is a lot of opportunity to take unpaid time off when they offer it, called ATO, though again it's unpaid.

","At 11.83 the pay for this job is below minimum standards for other call center jobs, especially given the amount of work you have to do. You are dealing with people who are dying from cancer on a daily basis who need insurance, but because they did not sign up during open enrollment period they will end up dying. You have to read scripting and basically behave like robot over the phone or your performance will suffer. ATO counts against your hours worked so if you take too much ATO you will lose your insurance benefit. The job itself is incredibly emotionally taxing and 100% stressful. Old equipment, internal resources refusing to help and give information they are paid to do. Most agents do not do their job so if you do, you are left to clean up the messes.

","I was treated terribly by General Dynamics. The managers were demeaning and unsupportative. Engineers were given huge responsibilities with little rewards. My work my first year at General Dynamics was top notch and I was given no raise. Management was top heavy and the real work was being done by employees and engineers. Overtime was expected with no compensation. The office was considered a 'sweat shop.' Women were treated unequally while African American engineers were absent from the workplace. A 'good old boy' atmosphere was persistent. Managers were not poor and lacked leadership skills. Overall I would.not recommend working here.

","The leadership and management was the absolute worst. They mircomanged everything! They also did not fire employees that deserved to be fired. When an employee does not do their own work, they lie, they cause conflicts, lie on their time cards, they reward the employee by giving them less work to do. Poor leadership leads to higher turn over rate and employees being disgruntle. This environment causes good and hardworking employees to leave. The managers will pretend that employees that are left were on good terms, when really majority of employees left because of management or the lack of benefits. The vacation benefits are not great. You only get two weeks of vacation a year. I would not recommend working for this company.

","Working on different projects is like working for different companies. Company rules and policies are implemented at the discretion of local management and are not actively monitored by corporate. Investigations of serious wrongdoing not initiated by the customer are paid lip service and investigated often by the same layer of management being accused of the infractions.

I personally worked a project where salary rises for all employees (except project management) were suspended because management offered to reduce contract costs to please the customer.

After loosing a contract bid AFTER 10 YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL MULTIMILLION DOLLAR AWARDS, GD refused severance to staff, many who had been with the contract since its inception, because the project ""wasn't funded for it"".
Advice to Management
Long term employee and customer loyalty is far more valuable than short term profit. Stop paying lip service to policies. Leave the cushy offices in the Beltway and get out there amongst your multitude of contracts and see how your customers and employees are really treated. Make you contract management accountable even if they lead a profitable contract. Stop sending management complaints back to the same layer of management that the complaint is being lodged by.

Sat Mar 07 2015, Principal Quality Engineer,"Lincoln, NE",Former Employee ,Just sign this so we can keep these parts moving.,2,"It was a decent group of people, and I enjoyed being around most of them. Compensation was fine for the Midwest.
","The culture is entirely about keeping parts moving toward shipping. The normal response to a defect is to keep processing while the customer documents their acceptance of the failure. The entire company seems to have skipped school the day they talked about ""continuous improvement."" Management does not tolerate questions or any challenge of decisions. It's a very 1960's organization and culture. They mention the word ""team"" but being a team player means only that you do what you're told - what management wants. It's a demoralizing, stifling culture that drains the life out if anyone who wants to contribute to making the place better.

It’s normal to cut lower level employees and engineers to an extent, but when 50+% of the work force are cut, and not one manager above the engineering level is affected what does that mean? How could that possibly be related to horrendous overhead rates?!? (Note sarcasm) 

If you are an engineer you will be part of a “caste” system. There is a clear hierarchy that is not as apparent between departs as it is shown by management… specific departs were “pay leveled” by management, while others were given assurances their department wouldn’t get hit. – This makes sense based on your business model and technical products, but don’t claim to function as a “team” when there are clear favorites.

Get organized. Figure out ONE list of rules and stick to it. Stop forcing us to retrain every other week, just because you hired incompetent trainers and utilized outdated books. If you could have bothered getting our training right day one, we wouldn't need ""Desk 2 Desks"" and CUP topics. 

Stop inventing new ways to fire people. We are all happy to abide by your silly dress code (seriously, WHO can see us over a PHONE??) and we all agreed not to swear, own paper and cell phones on the floor, do drugs or otherwise act stupid. But by assigning ""attendance points"" for those of us who've been sick or couldn't make it to work due to weather, you are in fact punishing us for REAL LIFE. Permanently stop it. NOW. We are not robots, we're human beings with lives outside of the call center. 

Trust me, if I was a parent, and I had to choose between wasting 8 hours being screamed at over the phone, and threatened by the incompetent managers you hired in ~ most of whom have NO phone experience AT ALL, or spending the day in a clinic making sure my kid is healthy, guess what? Junior WILL take precedence. Don't like it? Too bad. But punishing me over something you acknowledge I have no control over is at best misguided, but above all, very unprofessional. 

Update your material. I failed two calls, back to back, for not reading a script... that did not exist. That's right! Your ""quality"" team failed me for not reading an appeals script that was NEVER written. HOW can I read an imaginary script??

Pay attention to your feedback. Stop sending me these copy-and-paste responses, like ""Thank you for your concern. We will share this with CMS"" and start addressing the issues. Own up to them. We CSR's want to help overblown companies like yours to stay afloat. We don't want to see another company go belly up as we badly need jobs. But if you refuse to communicate with us, then it's nearly impossible to help you.

Stop harassing me because I didn't take overtime. I have a real life, one that includes other human beings, namely family members. You already see me over 8 hours a day (since these calls can rarely wrap up in under 10 minutes) you don't need me to work an additional 4-6 hours on top of that. Some of the other CSR's already pull their weight at 10-11 hour shifts, and certainly help each other more than a ""floor walker"" can, so stop trying to push them to stay over on top of that.

Stop inventing new hoops to jump through. It's obvious you need people. The fact that you have between 14-16 call centers, each with 600-1000 employees, all working on the Health Insurance Marketplace, and yet you only have 200 people total, doing ISG and ARC for all of us, is nothing short of pathetic. If the abysmal waiting period isn't bad enough, it's that a majority of the 200 don't want to do their jobs at all. Yet if we fail a call, and fail to consult these ""wizards"" of the call center, you dangle it over our heads that we ""may never"" get hired on as a ""real"" CSR, and may remain as temps until your next layoff. Once more, you need US more than we need you. And considering my electric bill this month, the fact you need me more is frightening. I needed to earn cash honestly, but at least I have options. Now that the London branch is more than half empty, it is clear you are understaffed, and in danger of losing this contract. Stop acting like an 11 year old little girl in a clique, get your act together, and hire more people on as permanent CSR's. Ditch the temp jobs until Christmas.

Stop inventing ""priority days"" to further punish those who have to blow a Monday for a doctor visit. We already have a high call volume in a fast environment, we don't need the added stress of being threatened an extra 5 points, just because you feel like it.

(It's a job)",1,"Not a pro so much as a description of the company. I've been with the company 5 years. I've worked on numerous contracts with varying initiatives, and each had a different management team. Those management teams were all very different, so it's hard to explain how the experience would be for an incoming employee. One commonality is the large number of hours that need to be worked. If you're not okay with that, this probably isn't your company. For me there was a bonus of being able to work from home most of the time, but I know that doesn't necessarily hold true for people who live close to offices. Also, being virtual usually equates to a lot of travel, which obviously varies with the job role. There is a lot of retired former military in the management, and sometimes those management styles come through - this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you'll not find a lot of office horseplay. It's a serious and professional environment, perhaps even stuffy at times. Frankly I've hated it at times, but I'm glad I've worked here. It's challenging and I've learned a lot and gained real fortune 100 experience, but it's not for everyone.
","There is no clear path for advancement in this company. The people I've seen move up have been around a long time, work hard, and also seem to have experienced a bit of luck in their situations. For example, it's not like you can work hard for a specific VP seat, but if there's a new contract win you might find a juicy role if you played a big part in winning the contract or have skills in performing the work needed. This is not the best paying company out there, there are no financial incentives. The Sr. management seems to know market rates and works to strike a fair wage. You can make a living, but you won't get rich. When a contract ends, I've seen some very good people let go because they couldn't find them a new project, yet the job board has hundreds of postings. There's no synergy in HR between the various GD companies, and I've seen a lot of people tossed aside at the end of a contract in just few years I've been here. One very skilled employee told me he couldn't get HR to call him back about a posting... now he's gone. Don't think once you get your foot in the door that you have a job for life, you really have to work hard, and even then there is no guarantee you'll have a job next year. Management appears to have little to no budget to keep people idle, to the point that you have to question what is the best balance of savings / performance for the shareholders.

Next, bring in leaders from successful divisions to run operations until adequate candidates can be found and developed from inside. Third, make sure that the new leadership actually is co-located with the people they lead; remove the palaces in Mahogany Row and revoke all other executive privileges. Fourth, fix the time accounting system and remove the other administrative roadblocks.

Fri Apr 29 2011,N/A,"Dallas, TX","Material Planner I in Dallas, TX","Avoid General Dynamics SATCOM Technologies Richardson, TX like the plague.",3,"The General Dynamics name looks good on your resume, but SATCOM Technologies is just a small to medium sized company owned by General Dynamics which isn't run anything like the real General Dynamics company, and has none of the good benefits that a large company has.
","See rewiews listed under SATCOM Technologies without a location to see the actual SATCOM Technologies ratings & reviews.
I worked at General Dynamics SATCOM Technologies, located in Richardson, TX as a Materials and Production Planner / Coordinator for over 4.5 years and there was never any acknowledgement or appreciation shown for any of the many good things done because they were so busy constantly trying to find anything they could find that wasn’t 100% accurate 100% of the time, which they would make things up and lie if they couldn't find something done 100% accurate.
The company is owned by General Dynamics in name, but is actually a small to medium sized company that operates under its own rules which they'll twist around and make up as they go along to suit their needs at the moment.
Their job descriptions on job postings nearly always list “other duties as assigned” so they can keep adding more and more duties you’re responsible for doing. And if you inform them you’re already performing the greatest number of tasks you can possibly do, they just say you need to work more overtime to keep up or they’ll force you to work up to 60 hrs by making it mandatory. Management will lie and twist what you say and what they’ve said around to meet whatever their need is at that moment, and the employee is always guilty no matter that written documentation you have to prove your innocence all the way up to the corporate office in Duluth GA.
The duties listed in the job description I hired in under as a Materials Planner I only listed a small portion of the duties I was performing when I finally turned in my resignation. No matter what I did it was never good enough because everything had to be 100% accurate 100% of the time or I was written up for not performing an adequate job or not performing my job fast enough, even though my supervisor had no knowledge of what it took to do many of my duties which includes the manual forecasting on a 45 to 50 page MS Excel report. Other duties added that wasn't in the original job listing was the requirement to also plan and coordinate the purchasing, kitting, and building of production jobs, managing the FG inventory and performing all inventory transactions in their inventory program that is little more than an accounting program with a limited inventory module included. I was also responsible for verifying that all inventory transactions had been performed prior to accounting closing the job charge numbers, turning in purchase requisitions in to purchasing for all common stock used on the manufacturing floor, inventory and WIP cycle counting and many other duties not listed on the original job description other than what would fall under the “other duties as assigned” category.
HR and management throughout the company gives supervisors a free pass to treat their employees as badly as they would like. This way the company saves money by having an excuse to give employees even less of a pay increases than the normal low 2% annual rate increase that's normally given out to non-management employees. My supervisor and co-workers supervisors have admitted that our site management has had them lower our ratings they had given us on our yearly reviews to match what money and over all ratings they had already decided to give each employee earlier in the year.
Advice to Management
SATCOM Technologies Management needs to learn to value and appreciate their employees when a good job is done, and not take them for granted and feel that they can treat their employees any way they like and expect them to stay around for long.
I had heard management say to me and several other employees that we should appreciate that we have a job and be willing to do whatever is asked of us because jobs are hard to come by these day’s, which is in no way a professional attitude or thing to say to your employees who are doing everything possible to do an excellent job and help the company perform at its best.

My advice to the upper management team over Axsys Nashua is that they should take a good hard look at requirements for good, solid leadership and determine if their upper management team has what it takes to lead the company. If the employees are unhappy or discouraged and believe they aren't being recognized for work well done then the morale will go down as well as productivity. Axsys should consider hiring human resource personnel who have the experience and know how to balance between management and the employees. Management also needs to give recognition and offer advancement where it is due.

","Typical large company. HR and Management often rely more on years of experience rather than performance and merit for promotions. Yearly raises are often less than inflation, although the empoyee will receive a good review. Company is a government contractor and has the obligation to follow government mandated affirmative action goals; this regularly results in advancement of employees that are not qualified, or are not as qualified as others competing for a particular job.
Advice to Management
Better communication with employees would go far in helping to establish a more cooperative interdepartmental working culture. Concentrate on rewarding nonmanagement employees for quality work.

Sun Nov 30 2008,N/A,,Senior Systems Engineer ,"A great company, a great place to work",0,"Recognition, the good outcomes always have a name associated and a good project completed is published.
Oportunities for advancement are always open and your supervisor is also your mentor and counselor.
Good humor is always present, even at high stress times (we think humor is the last thing we'll lose).
Morale is high and cooperation is widespread. Doors are always open for help. Past experience is valued and also shared.
Even though vacation time is rather limited, personal needs are contemplated and there is no preset limit to those needs, as long as your direct supervisor approves.
In short: a great place to work inside a great company!

Wed Jun 11 2008,N/A,,Software Engineer ,"General Dynamics, 10 years behind the work place cultural times.",4,"General Dynamics has good job security. Being a defense contractor means there will be jobs until we have world peace. The benefits aren't too bad.
","General Dynamics and the other military subcontractors can be a magnetic industry. That is, once you're in you can't get out and it can be difficult to get jobs elsewhere. What people do at GD often doesn't translate to corporate work due to cultural and technology differences. There are exceptions to this and some pockets where amazing stuff happens.

In many parts of the company it's not fun to be at work and most of the employees I've spoken with don't really want to work there. They are there because they have nothing else going on or are comfortable.
Advice to Management
Make General Dynamics a place people want to work at. This is often not the case. And, making it more fun is a cultural thing and not something you can program by giving away more hockey tickets.
