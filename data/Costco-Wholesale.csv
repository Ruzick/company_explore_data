I have been working at Costco Wholesale part-time for more than a year
Pros
Very affordable high quality health insurance benefits even for PT employees. Great for working parents who split up child care and need coverage. The key to succeeding at Costco is to work hard, have a good attitude and be nice to people. It's hard work and fasted paced, you have to be down for that to succeed.
Cons
At this warehouse you are required to work 5 days per week, even if you are PT at 24 or so hours. This means lots of 4-5 hour shifts rather than fewer 8 hour shifts which is tough for those who commute a long distance to work or have to cover day care.
Advice to Management
Allow the PT staff at 24/hours per week or so to work 4/6 hour shifts or 3/8 hour shifts rather than 4 and 5 hour shifts. it gets expensive for those who commute a long distance to work or have to cover day care.

","UNION Buildings with lots of seniority SUCKSSSSS
The bad part of good retention rates is that people work here FOREVER. Many stays in the same place, and many union stores, essentially lock out the opportunity to go to some positions, or you end up losing every opening to people who are completely lazy but have been there for 25 years. Jumping around departments taking all the entry-level positions possible.
Lack of leadership skills with management. My manager became very close with some of the ladies who were barely a year in the store. She even had them on her wedding court. All 3 of those girls were supervisors within a year without having any reason other than their friendships. VERY CLIQUEY. Those who worked and mind their business had clear disadvantages.

Take the time to sit down with each and every manager and supervisors and make sure you guys are ALL on the same page when it comes to company rules and policies. There’s no reason at all for any manager or supervisor to have TERRIBLE communication. One person says one thing and another says something different. Also try not to play favorites too much, all the other employees can see when it happens and they don’t like it either. Also for the younger supervisors, stop letting that red vest get to your head. Yes you have ‘power’ and ‘authority’ but don’t go around having a power trip because you can. One last thing for management, please please please, get those front end guys some help by getting better supervisors or at least ones who don’t stand around and do absolutely nothing. Overall just try to be better people.

Advice to Management
Management was a hit or miss when it came to Costco. For new workers, they will put the guys outside pushing carts, and the women mostly inside working the register or clothing. Also, the management would barely rotate people from outside to inside very often, and if you do too well outside, then expect to spend most of your days out there. Customers tend to also be a mix. Most customers mean well, and some are just the worst. Overall, I think it is worth the pay of $15/hr.

","The recent pandemic has brought a lot of good and bad out of people....and the companies we work for. I have learned Costco is far less concerned with thier employee's well being than they are with thier bottom line. Despite COVID outbreaks and employee concern, we are still expected to happily show up to work everyday (even during statewide shut-downs) when the option to work remotely is a safe and productive option. The company has an outdated culture of the good ole boys club, with minimal advancement and pay increase for minorities and females along with being closed minded on culture today. The ""costco way"" is focused on the operations business and the corporate teams are blended into the pool of ""diversity and inclusion"" Costco claims to represent. Although Costco has been lucrative in light of the pandemic, this culture cannot thrive forever and many good corporate employees will (continue to) be lost.

-Safety should be an even higher priority, I worked in major sales for 8 years with experience in other departments, the upper management will continuously bombard you with tasks over the radio when your department will be under staffed because the front end needed them, but they never understand that you need them too, so your handling 2 different members at the same time with less staff & still trying to finish the first task they asked you while still answering respectfully for each call. Sometimes I would be alone in the department and the staff would make me move big furniture alone and would never send anyone to help, but whenever they asked for our help we always went up to the front end.

Tue Oct 20 2020, Cashier/Gas Station Attendant,,Current Employee ,It's fine,0,"It's a great company if you are looking for something simple. Costco is often called the ""Dream Killer"", for many reasons, none of which are bad. They pay their employees well, they provide amazing benefits, and they are a fantastic work environment (for the most part). It's hard to leave Costco after you've been there for a few years because starting somewhere else, you're almost guaranteed to have to take a paycut and lose benefits.
","Top-out pay is only so high and the level of entitlement from the people that shop at Costco can be extremely overwhelming, and will take an incredible mental and emotional toll that can honestly be expected from any retail company. It's retail, what do you expect? My biggest problem is that the company is fraught with favoritism, but honestly, what company isn't?
Advice to Management
You cannot be neutral in a debate about the life of the employees you claim to care so much about. Black lives do matter, and many of your employees are black. Defend them. You would be surprised how little it would harm your bottom line.

Great coworkers and always busy, time passes by fast. Free food in the break room during certain holidays.
","They absolutely do not train you for most of the positions They quite literally throw you in there without explaining much. And then when you mess up, it's on you. Only once you mess up, you're explained how to properly do the job that was given to you. But guess what? You're going to keep messing up and looking bad because you were never fully taught what to do. It's because they don't actually care about the seasonal employees. They're bottom of the bill and expendable. God forbid you actually put in some effort to train us first.
Advice to Management
Train your seasonals every time you shift them to a new position. Take the 10 or 15 minutes to do this. Otherwise they will keep doing things wrong, and then you'll boot them out for it. You expect employees to ask lots of questions. We do. Yet you still punish us for messing something up. One of the managers even looked annoyed when I asked him some questions. Most of the managers acted like I'm begging for this job and that I'd be lucky to get it. That's not motivating.

★★★★★
Current Employee - Front End Floater in Colorado Springs, CO
I have been working at Costco Wholesale part-time for less than a year
Pros
Costco is a great company to work for when it comes to benefits and a good hourly wage. During busier seasons you can easily pick up more hours. If you are hard-working and do whatever task or job you are put on it is not hard to be recognized for that. There are several different departments you can be trained in which will give you a more versatile experience and job opportunity.
Cons
Communication from management or to management can be weak; there have been a few occasions or school classes I have had to change my work schedule for, and I directly and clearly communicated it to several of the managers and I was still scheduled for days I was unable to come into work. Many of the employees at Costco do not seem to enjoy their job...possibly being that they have been there for years.
Advice to Management
Communication from managers to other managers, as well as communication documentation would help decrease scheduling mishaps and other policies or information that must be given or received.

I have no complaints or criticisms.,0,"Amazing pay and benefits. 401K match, topped out at $23.50 after 6 years and from then on received bonuses every 6 months. After 5 years I got 2 $1,500 bonus per year; at 7 years 2 $2,000 bonuses per year; and at 10 years 2 $2,500 bonus per year. The highest was 2 $3,000 bonuses per year at 20 years of service. The quality of work and employees is top notch. They have a generous medical and dental package. It was less than $40 for me and my child per month taken out of my paycheck. They have paid sick leave and paid vacation time which steadily increases after years of service. The call in process was quick and painless. They offered a free trip to Hazeldon and FMLA leave through the company for my struggles with Addiction. They stuck by me until I couldn't fight my addictions any longer and decided to resign. Most of my Costco friends still work there and are lifers. We remain friends to this day.
","It is a tough working on your feet on concrete floors 40 hours a week. My body suffered with a lot of joint pain.

Advice to Management
These times are hard on everyone. Your employees are getting dumped on by the members. Member Service is catching much of it right at the door. You'd be served well to remember the loyalty your employees have shown. The ""you're replaceable"" mentality, though it may be true, doesn't foster a positive work environment or bolster member satisfaction. Think about encouraging your managers to spend more time one on one with the employees. They need some positive interactions badly right about now.

","Working for Costco, especially in the supervisor/management world you will never have evenings and weekends off. My manager has been with the company 25 years and he closes the front end every single day and has two week days off. This is a member based company so we bend over backwards for our members and get genuinely walked all over us as employees. The words I’m going to go to corporate or I’ve been a an executive member for 10+ years and I send a ton of money at your store, go along way and we have to find a way to say yes. Yes I understand that’s how customer service works but unfortunately when you have a member screaming in your face because they forgot their ID and want to buy liquor and as a corporate company we are required to ask for ID if you appear under the age of 35 and your manager tells you to just go ahead and do it to get the guy out out here...that’s not okay, that’s illegal and makes me look stupid for refusing you service just to end up ringing him up anyway. That’s a small minimal sintuation I can name 100+ situations. You had to have to serious backbone to work for this company. Management has very high expectations as for as performance. We are compensated very well for these expectations however it’s still very mentally dragging.

","The only way to move to up into a good position is if you are married to a manager, dating one, or just straight forward agreeing with everything the higher-level manager says (even if they are wrong)! 

Management has their favorites who they make unique accommodations for. They also give positions to recent graduates (that's what they will tell people when denying them) over a person who has been dedicated to the company for years, even though Costco says no degree is required to move up. 

Another thing, because ""employees get paid well, they should be able to do the work of 2 or 3 people"" (those were the actual words of a manager). The employees are overworked and stressed out. Many people think employees stay there because they are very content with how they are treated and compensated. Although the pay and benefits are great, most remain there because they have a family to support, no education or have been there too long to start again; therefore, they tolerate the job and try and make it through their shifts.

Most employees have been working there for years; it becomes like a family environment, which is good. However, management is very unprofessional, do not respect people, tell other people's business and they let their ""buddies"" get away with everything. 

Too many hard working employees (long-time employees) have left because of the managers' inability to follow the guidelines and procedures and their unprofessionalism.
Advice to Management
I don't know if this type of behavior occurs at all Costcos'. I sure hope it doesn't. Managers, you guys get paid quite a good salary and benefits there; please start doing your job right and treat people with respect.

","Costco claims to ""Take care of our employees"" in the code of ethics, but the longer I've been at Costco, the closer I get to the management the more it has come up as a lie. 
During snowpocolypse, Costco started to punish employees who couldn't make it to work and didn't have the PTO to cover it. They later reversed the decision for hourly employed, but salary employees were still not allowed to use sick time for weather excuses.
When COVID started to become a concern, many employees asked for accommodations to work from home. At first Costco refuses because they felt it was unfair to those working in the warehouses. Then people started to get sick, so they started to let people who had health concerns work from home. Then someone died and Costco got slammed in the news. Well, once members were upset Costco started sending people home. 
Now Costco is requiring people back into the office - even teams that are working successfully from home and maintaining productivity. They won't allow LOA, wwon't consider health concerns. When you ask someone in management with other people around the answer is ""We will take it on a case by case basis."" When you ask them 1-1, the answer changes to ""Quit, demote, or go to the office.""
I joined Costco because of their reputation, but their unwillingness to adapt is destroying that reputation and it's apparent its a repeating issue. 
Hiring internally is also really only possible for certain positions, other positions still require experience or applicable degree like most other companies FYI.

Listen to your employees. Don't tell people that their concerns don't matter to you because they ""complain a lot"", especially when they work in a department with a high turnover rate. Instead of blaming the little guy instead look to why it's possible. If the same 2 positions are impossible to keep filled for more than a year, look into it. Stop moving people up in positions because of their family and instead give to people who earned it. And, stop twiddling your thumbs in the office and actually help your employees, for once.

Thu Sep 03 2020, Produce Associate,"Duluth, GA",Current Employee ,Don't Believe in the Hype,1,"Honestly this work is not what its made out to be. If you work the front end doing super easy work (except with carts) getting full hours this job will be great but if you work any of the hard departments and the HARDEST depart of produce then this job all depends on your team. The pay is okay lots of warehouse jobs willing to pay $15 hours as a base and raises are only hours put in (5-8 years) to be maxed out.
","There are alot of cons at Costco at least at the Duluth location. The co-workers in the afternoon and evening shift are filled with despicable, condescending, and immature workers. You're practically in a high school with how much judgement you get and they aren't very high on character either. As for the produce department the training is absolutely horrible at least at the Duluth location. Their training is a sink or swim environment which is why they're are short staffed. It also doesn't help that being short staffed that when you do get a hard working employee that being short staffed you can't train to teach that employee because nobody can teach them. Costco is not a good place to work and their turnover rate at least in the Duluth location is high and why they struggle to have employee stay at the hardest department like produce or any other very rigorous department. None of the co-workers shed any explanation or pragmatic way on working the morning shift at Costco and is why everyone literally everyone in the produce department is over 28+ years old (the youngest being maybe 27). Don't believe in the hype at Costco unless you work a easy department like front end, customer service, HR, or any other easy department. Working at the hardest department you still get paid the base pay as anyone. If you think working produce is the same as working the front end doing no labor work but getting the same pay the produce department will always have a terrible culture, short staffed, and high turnover. Costco might be pay alot but eventually these types of work environments, culture, and pay will get their back turned on by their employees and will kill long-term success and vision. I wouldn't be surprised if Costco ends up getting beat by another competitor in the next 50 years. Also, good luck working at produce when there is so much dead weight and everyone is 50+ years old. Costco is a terrible place to work. It takes you 1-2+ years to get full time and that only if it is available and everything falls in place from your training, hours, and availability. There are so many variables at Costco that benefits are not fully given either. You get part time benefits which is no equivocal to full time.
Advice to Management
Learn to actually train your new employees and give them a system so that they don't have to question or feel like they're useless. Hard working, hustling, and strong new employees will not stay at or will want to be there working when the job is a mind field of terrible training. Costco being shot staffed, with high turnover, and no blue print is not how you ""care"" about employees or even treat the employee fairly. Costco barely inches out ahead of Sam's club but nobody will stay at a place or transfer to another department when the work you do is second rate and no pay is accommodating to the work. If you have a hard working, hustle, and diligent employee treat them with some respect and don't give them second rate treatment. Costco incentive to pay more is definitely off set by their culture, treatment, environment, and ability to train, care, educate, and grow their employees. Definitely a toxic, cancerous, and terrible place to work retail.

They encourage cross-training which is great, but allows them to pull you anywhere at anytime (sweating outside one minute to dealing with the public behind a cash register the next)
You have to treat it like an audition until you’re fully “in”. You are watched closely and have to act nearly perfect.
Many coworkers are jealous/nosey about promotions, schedules
Advice to Management
Pay more attention to the little guy. We know you are stressed and juggling a million things a day, but at the end of of the day it’s just retail. There are a lot of “lifers” who are very comfortable and not going anywhere, making bank and some doing the bare minimum (if that) required. Encourage us to do our best by treating us all equally and working along side us rather than way above us or somewhere in the background. The more you invest in us, the more we will want to do for you.

","Easily the most toxic work environment I've ever been involved in. Employees AND management gossip openly about each other, sometimes in the break room for others to hear. Managers take credit for hourly employee's hard work. A pathetic excuse for a sexual harassment policy. They do an ""investigation "" which usually results in the guilty person just being moved to another location instead of fired - allowing them the opportunity to sexually harass again (I've seen it personally, and they are still employed). There's this attitude of ""be thankful you have a job"" which makes employees reluctant to speak up about about issues. When someone does speak up their words fall on deaf ears with some managers. Management spends a ridiculous amount of time on theie phones.
Advice to Management
Follow the employee agreement better. It's there for a reason. Stop giving serial sexual harassers multiple chances. Employees shouldn't be uncomfortable at work because of a few sickos that can't be respectful. When an employee brings up a concern stop treating us like we're just whining and actually look into what the root cause of this issue might be.

Advice to Management
Stop treating your 25+ year employees that made this company what it is today feel the pressure of the pre-planned, schemes of replacing us with younger family related people especially in both accounting divisions. Managers, Directors and Supervisors in both Accounting divisions are snakes and will stab you in the back. They are like a cult. Admin Assistants also don't have your back. They play you into friendship hoping you'll say something negative. They'll be on their way to telling somebody before you can finish your sentence. HR is pro management so don't risk that. If you go to HR, your management team will take you down before you know it. The old Costco culture has disappeared. Taken away by Millenials that have zero respect for older employees. The call center is managed by supervisors with 3-4 years with the company and have ZERO experience regarding respect, taking constructive criticism from older employees. They think they know it all. I believe the Sr. Management in this Division is clueless to what's happening. They're turning member services into who can take the most calls/chats per hour, who can have the best AHT (average handle time) In other words get the member off the phone and move on to getting every member off the phone every call all day every day
