It’s disgraceful seeing people who hardly did any work and they are the ones who get promoted. I heard someone got a job due to that person being in the same fraternity as the Director.

I always had unaligned leads to contact, but I'm not sure if that is still the policy.
","Health benefits don't start until you hit a certain amount of production. Also, you don't get access to the unaligned leads until you hit that same threshold of production. The motivation is to incentive new employees to ask senior financial professionals for their unaligned leads and to do meetings together. There's a pittance salary for several weeks (which does run out) while you try to hit the threshold to be considered a full time employee. There's also a few financial bonuses after you become a full time employee for sticking around. However, the job is basically cold calling and commission only.

I once spent 18 months spinning wheels on a project with 15 other associates. In that time we were forced to create lengthy power point presentations that said nothing. Our final results were nothing more than a list of a few ways Prudential could hire people. Ridiculous. After years in this environment, you realize it isn't fixable and not worth your time and effort. I quickly learned that I could get away with not working while being paid a very high salary. I would show up at meetings here and there but spent hours each day at the gym next door, working out with many other Prudential employees doing the same. Also worked from home often where I caught up on home chores. Lastly there are many employees there who do not know how to keep their hands to themselves and eyes where they belong.

Prudential provides lip service to diversity, but does not truly embrace it, and leverage it to better itself. Thought leadership at the organization appears uniform from upper/senior management. A better job should be done communicating across and within product lines. A better job should be done to consider long term health over short term stock gains. Prudential is huge - talent is an average cross section with the Financial Services industry...not better. Recognize that. Hold management at all levels accountable (there is a complete lack of this today). There are far too many employees in jobs that aren't worthy of their job grade, especially at the Manager level and up.

Improve decision making. Try being less political in your messaging to your employees. Hold business leaders accountable for their professional behavior (or lack thereof). Interacting with business leadership is akin to herding unruly toddlers at a kindergarten who are throwing petulant tantrums and have no ability to retain / remember information longer term.

Advice to Management
If you want your employees to perform well, you need to treat them like people. Not like corporate robots. The company literally hands out a book that has a section on Empathy. And management can't even practice that with their own workers. There are other companies out there who will pay you to do the same job, as much if not more money, and will treat you like a human being. Also, you will be hired onto a staffing agency and guaranteed benefits, and opportunities for growth within the company. DO NOT TRUST THIS. Their turnover is high because they do not hire people on or allow them to move up anymore. Since the pandemic the company has gone down hill. If you want to learn the job, take it for the training and then start searching at a new company once you've learned the tasks. Save yourself the headache.

The entire organization is pretty non-diverse and is filled with mediocre middle level and senior management( VPs and above) who have been with the company for decades and lack basic people management skills. Most of the leadership are in the manager roles not due to competency but only due to their tenure or their connections. The entire Marketing organization is filled with ex- CITI, AMEX and ETRADE folks who run an insurance company like a credit card business bringing in the toxic ""dog-eat-dog"" culture of unreasonable expectations, stifling innovation growth etc . The VPs hired from these companies in-turn bring their friends from previous work places, creating small tiny fiefdoms and promoting themselves. Pretty powerpoint presentations are the only output the organization really produces and acknowledges as outcomes. Innovation and growth are very hard to find anywhere and career growth is all depended on ""WHO"" you know and how many god-parents you have in the organization. Most VPs have an insane amount of ego and lack basic empathy, kindness or leadership qualities. Anyone with decent talent tends to leave the organization and there is decent amount of attrition of high performers.
Advice to Management

Pros
There is something quite genuine about the company’s commitment to purpose and deep desire to be a better, stronger and more modern company.
Cons
The most senior leadership seem hopelessly lost. Restructuring happens constantly. Every senior leader seems to surround themselves with their own consulting firm. All the big names are here and then the big names are supplemented with boutiques. Leaders are out of touch, internally focused and lack courage. They hide behind culture and risk.
Advice to Management
If you truly want to save money, either save the Millions you are pouring into consultants or offset the senior leadership bonuses to cover the consulting expense. What a perfect way to guarantee a bonus... pay a ton for leaders who hire consultants to do the tough cultural stuff. Maybe leaders should have more courage or be willing to get their hands dirty. The senior folks need to stop believing their own PR. The chaos and swirl needs to stop.

No change management teams were created as they made this massive organization change. The CMO thinks that he's Steve Jobs even though our website doesn't work.

Cumbersome platforms. Way behind the time with technology and support. I can’t express the lack of training, you’re legit on your own. 
Experienced professionals will eventually become customer service reps without any steady stream of income due to lack of time to meet/close new biz. I’d recommend working at a bank.
Advice to Management
I was here 6.5 years and the turnover is brutal. I made it this long because I’m a workhorse. Found out the hard way the company will not promote within. Believe me, my production was there. 
Management promises the world, yet delivers motivational words, not results. Lots of orphans but the company limits who you call, example: no investment orphans, and you’d think those clients would need the most attention and be most interested in meeting. As a fiduciary, that was my thought. 
Simply put, find another company that invests in their employees vs charging you to work here (support fees after two years of working here kick in and it’s not cheap). Management level positions (manager of financial services) is a pyramid scheme. If you want a promo you need to recruit people on your own before you’re considered. Production isn’t a factor. Constantly interviewing/hiring heads to slow the bleeding of losing reps.

Wed Mar 04 2020, Manager,"Newark, NJ",Current Employee ,Haven't looked back,1,"I've worked for several companies before Pru, and the experiences were never wholly positive. I was starting to wonder if it was even possible to be happy with your company, to be excited about work. Since joining Pru, I now know that it is—you just need to find the right company. So far, I've found that Pru has:

-Full flexibility (WFH)
-Unparalleled work/life balance
-Strong pay and bonuses
-Generous family leave
-A culture that emphasizes internal mobility
-A strong philanthropic culture that gives back to its communities
-Receptive and thoughtful leaders
-An extremely strong ethical philosophy overall

Yes, the company is undergoing a lot of changes, but that's de rigeur for the industry these days. It actually is creating a lot of opportunity internally, as the company explores new skill sets that it hasn't emphasized before. The company is in a great place for ambitious early career folks, or more mature professionals who want latitude to try new things.
","It's a 140+ year-old company, and there are some legacy things still hanging around. There can be an over-emphasis on seniority, and there can be a lot of unspoken rules about how to approach or interact with senior leaders. The company also has a way to go in embracing technology. That said, the company understands these challenges and is doing everything it can to turn things around.

Lots of folks with institutional knowledge left but so did some dead weight which is good I guess. The politics between the various businesses have always held Prudential back. People are loyal to whatever business unit they work in rather than the firm as a whole. That goes all the way to the top. 

Promotions are very political especially in the Chief Marketing Office. People that have come from Citigroup for example promote their own buddies while rockstars who are not part of their click get left out.

Mon Feb 10 2020, Director,,Current Employee ,Difficult culture to understand and assimilate,4,"Retirement plans, benefits.
","There are as many cultures as there are departments. Very difficult to understand what it takes to advance as the rules change frequently. Significantly behind in technology in most areas. Not a great learning and development culture as you will not get the development or experience that you will find at other companies. Process heavy culture. You will spend most of your time learning Prudential processes and not building transferrable skills. No focus on change management making the current environment very unsettling. Limited career advancement because many in management have been in their roles for significant length of time and are not going anywhere.
Advice to Management
Focus on competence and not just confidence in management. Stop changing the rules as you go.

Advice to Management
Start communicating more specifics of the vision. Bigger, Bolder, Faster is a nice slogan, but there's never been anything specific provided to employees regarding what skills they need to meet your goals. Also, you better get the Customer Office under control and produce something with a revenue stream, instead of wasting company money and employees valuable time on all day town halls where presenters say nothing impactful.

Thu Jan 09 2020, Outpatient Dietitian,"Syracuse, NY",Former Employee ,Stuck in the 1990s,2,"COWORKERS, some of my best friends and craziest experiences happened with some of the most hardworking & driven people that I have ever met. The company will support your growth heavily, if you make it to the top 10% of their earners and stick with them for 5+ years. I worked for the BEST, the #1 Prudential Advisors group- so also keep that in mind. Your experience will likely be even worse if you are not in Upstate, NY
","The company gives you little to no support. You are your secretary, compliance officer, customer service associate, driver, marketer, office manager, and then you look for clients that you can make money off of with annuities and life insurance. Sometimes managed money...Warm leads, means cold calling with an excuse, they are ""orphan"" clients that do not have a current prudential advisor (that are dwlindling in number) that have often been called hundreds of times before you. If you happen to get ahold of one and set a meeting to review the clients life insurance, you then are trying to position yourself as their financial advisor. The clients typically already have a wealth management advisor, and the whole time working you are trying to find the next sale. There is NO SALARY. All sales chasing, commission only deals on product sales. The software Prudential uses is stuck in the 90s, it is horrible and salesforce is not built or utilizing extensions from the IT/Developers, that makes salesforce good. It is more of a way to document compliance (time consuming from your bottom line) & track which clients to contact next. The investment management software is so bad I couldn't handle it. Investment research/time to find a good portfolio or risk level for a client is just not possible with all the other tasks you have to do consistently to make ends meat. Americans no longer value life insurance besides some specific minority groups (Indian, Asian, etc)- look at the stats if you think this is racist or wrong. The entire demographic you target is middle-low income Americans who have no guidance, with roughly 200K-600K in retirement savings. Typically advisors scare them about bear markets, an inevitable crash, or running out of money into retirement, at which place they pitch an annuity & put majority of the clients liquidity at risk.

This is basically a glorified suit wearing car salesman for annuities and life insurance. Prudential will tell you that you are a business owner, when you are the FARTHEST thing from such. The company has made no initiatives to change or improve customer/advisor experiences on issues that matter. The Middle managers that you will report to, will tell you everything positive to keep you- THEIR SALARIES ARE DETERMINED BY HIRING. They are ball and chained to you staying, so just remember that incentive is not for your own good. The industry has a less than 25% 4 year retention rate, because of how horribly structured and set up for failure new advisors are, especially new graduates. Imagine being thrown in the water trying to get clients that are trusting you with their entire nest egg life savings, when you are 22 years old. Not likely going to happen. The only way to succeed as a youngster is to latch onto a senior advisor that is open to Joint Work, and has a big book of business that you can eventually overtake and work off of in the meantime.
If you want to become a financial advisor, understand that you are location STUCK. Building a book of business within prudential is the name of the game that typically takes 4-7 years to build to make $70K plus & when you want to move, you are back at square one starting from scratch.
Advice to Management
Read my cons, figure it out. You won't because the shareholders & bottom line profits are all that matters. 

Support your advisors with a base salary, a legit base salary, your company has a better credit rating than the US Government, with trillions under management- yet you pay your business owning advisors, a $0 base salary. Makes sense, makes great sense.

IF YOU ARE YOUNG OUT OF COLLEGE, do not accept this position like I did. It stunts your growth in finance & pigeon holes you in sales. You are not an investment analyst or a business owner I cannot stress that enough. The lies/over promises, under deliveries from management are borderline fraudulent. If I wore a wire to some of my managers 1 on 1s in my first 6 months, I would have a legit lawsuit on my hands. Promises of 6 figures, 75+ qualified client leads monthly, growing my business with multiple assistants I don't have to pay (you have to pay them from your sales commissions if you want them) & relationships they will setup with attorneys/CPAs for you- it was a never ending lie fest to keep me for their own hiring bonuses.

Wed Jan 29 2020, Manager,"Sunnyvale, CA",Former Employee ,Prudential Sunnyvale - please stay away,1,"There were few pros but not anymore
","Silicon valley top management, especially the CTO operates like a mafia. Everything is controlled by this person, this level of narcissism is mind-blowing, and it trickles down. A bunch of people, usually her old friends and colleague are constantly brought in through the back door and its a continuum. People that are not part of this secret inner circle are constantly in the dark and have no idea what’s going on.

Every time interns are around there is pot luck. CTO and others behave like kids around them, it is agonizing to watch this coz normal times, this person doesn’t even get out of her cabin. I don’t think she has spoken to people sitting right in front of her cabin.

I have been living/working in the valley for a few years now, this place was a culture shock, so backward and so corrupt. A bunch of people calling themselves ‘architects’ still call shots from remote offices, and most of them are completely out of touch with the latest tools and trends. Name of the game here is ‘…just hang out and go home’.

New engineers are lured with the pretext of ‘stat up culture’. But the truth couldn’t be farther. There was an honest intention to run the silicon valley office like a startup. But constantly progressing wrong people including the CTO, has bread a culture of Narcissism and ‘yes men’ seeing a lot of growth.

There is no practical escalation in place, it exists in theory and it never works. If you are unhappy with someone, it is a gladiator fight with that person. Escalating yields noting, but still, the company’s code of conduct says ‘don’t confront’ if you have a problem, inform the manager. And the manager would never do anything. Old-timers know this very well and abuse this to the fullest.

Immigrants looking for career and immigration support, back off. Some folks here including HR are adept in abusing your time. These people don’t turn up like this overnight, they would have done this time and time again and perfected the art. Here’s how it goes, especially for green card EB2 has the following steps;

1. Prepping and Filing labor (4-6 months)
2. Labor approval (3-6 months)
3. Recruitment phase (within 6 months of labor approval) - where HR Fraud candidates
4. I140 filing and approval (4-8 months)
5. The rest of the process doesn’t matter since employer non-portability ends here.

In total, it takes 18-24 months to just apply for I140. 

HR and others in the organization know this very well. So what they do is, after step 3 (you would’ve already invested 10-15 months), you will be told that there are many strong candidates applying for that role so let's wait and see how it goes (this will be a blatant lie, no one would be interviewed). But after labor approval ie step 2, it is valid only for 6 months, if you don’t file i140 by then, you are back in line for step one and it will take 18 more months again. You are stuck with the company however messed up your director is, only people profiting with this whole deal are the HR, your director, and CTO, so they abuse it to the fullest. I have witnessed this.

Many people have been laid off, pods of contractors are let go, smart people have never been retained. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.
Advice to Management
Change has to come from the top, and prudential Sunnyvale needs a serious overhaul at CTO level rest should all fall in place because normally it is one person that blocks all the goods and progress. If this person is replaced by someone honest and capable, everything should fall in place. This office has smart and hard-working individuals, narcissism bred by top management has tied them down.

","Depending on the group, Bureaucracy
Lack of incentives
Advice to Management
There really are dozens of different “Prudential’s”. It’s not a bad place to work as an insurance agent. What people don’t realize is how big the asset management business is, which is huge (#10 in the world). That’s a very good place to work for. However the law department is mind-numbingly, soul-crushingly bureaucratic. Senior management within the law department may be good lawyers, but they’re horrible managers, and they’ve run amok. There is absolutely zero incentive to do anything other than the bare minimum (“everyone is a ‘3’” is the mantra of the law department’s HR group - on a scale of 1-5). Decisions are largely form over substance, with a top-down management style that stifles any kind of dissenting, constructive feedback under the guise of not being a team player. At a recent law conference, they announced cutbacks, and when asked how we were coordinating these efforts with our business “partners”, a member of senior management responded that “we know better than they do what they need”.

Um, no, you don’t. 

If you’re thinking of working at Pru, take a look at the group you’ll be working for. They vary greatly. As for advice to management, Charlie or someone senior really needs to get involved in what’s going on in the law department, take a look at the EQ results and ask senior management what they’re doing about it. For the last dozen or so EQ surveys senior management’s response has been the same: tell mid level managers to tell their staff why they should feel lucky to work here, rather than having any kind of self-reflection to see that they are the problem, and that the solution needs to come from them, as well.

Moreover, if you resign don’t expect your “express” commissions to be paid right away. They will pay those (if so happens) 14 weeks after the date you resigned.

Tue Jul 16 2019, Registered Representative,,Former Employee ,Underpay and Sexist,3,"Mon-Fri work week. Office setting.
","Management is all male and are known as the ""Men's Club"". As compared to other companies that require the same licenses, they incredibly underpay people and prey on Veterans and their spouses to fill these positions. I took a 55% pay cut because it is in the same field as my degree with a promise of quick promotion based on my years of management experience. Never happened. HR complaints about sexist behavior and sexual harassment in the work place were swept under the rug. Visiting officials noticed the behavior and would have ""talks"" with upper management, but nothing ever changed.

It is a call center but they refuse to call it that or advertise it as such. You will be a glorified call center rep required to obtain federal licenses when you could go down the street to Dish Network and make more money without needing the licenses.

Their work facilities are pleasant and comfortable and they offer decent pay and health benefits.
","As large corporations are concerned, Prudential is typical (not in a good way), when it comes to career advancement, real inclusion and diversity across all organizational levels and hiring from within. Culturally, Prudential espouses ""employee development"" and ""career advancement"", but in reality does not demonstrate support of their employees when they try to accomplish this. Like most large companies, advancement is doled out to based on ""who you know"" and not necessarily ""what you can offer"". Over the last 12 months Prudential has changed (CEO) leadership and with that has come a slew of layoffs that most would agree could have been handled better.

Because job is commission and bonus only, you have to learn how to make the most of your time. There are plenty of people to call and set appointments, and many people to work jointly as everyone is the same boat. You can design your own schedule and be as independent as you want it to be. Better than a 1099 firm because you get real benefits and training is decent. In addition, Prudential's products are very competitive but you do have to actively market yourself.
","No real structure unless you put yourself down to it, therefore it is easy to lose weeks because not enough appointments were set beforehand, thereby slowing down sales. Also a lot of people quit early on, so there's a lot of turnover. That means you have to be quick on your feet and constantly be reinventing your business, and be willing to field train reps that might leave. I think this is typical of a sales firm environment.

Fri May 31 2019,Anonymous,"El Paso, TX",Former Employee ,Pru El Paso,5,"Prudential offers great PTO and Benefits.
","El Paso Prudential is not on the same level as Prudential (corporate). It's actually one of the worse places I've ever worked for. If El Paso Pru was anywhere near the same as the corporate offices, I'd have stayed but maybe it's an El Paso thing because Leadership doesn't seem to have any common sense and the majority of the employees are seeking employment elsewhere. Several years ago when I started, it seemed like it was a great company to work for but lately leadership seems more interested in showing-off for social media but has lost sight of their current employees. They claim there is so much room for growth but the fact is they are begging for work to come to El Paso. They also pride themselves with hiring ex-military and spouses but yet treat these employees from their WOS groups worse than 2nd class citizens, I'm surprised they all haven't left. Salaries are extremely low and their aren't any goals or clear expectations on how to grow or get a higher salary.
Advice to Management
You have smart, educated, mid-to-high level employees whom are adults...start treating them as such. Allow more flexibility, allow more growth. Start spending on your current employees and treating them better. Quit saying you're going through growing pains; Prudential has been around for over 140 years and El Paso Prudential has been here for 4 years. Realize the employees you have are your biggest marketers, show them growth, higher compensation and flexibility and they will let everyone know what a great place it could be.

Wed Jan 23 2019, Mid Level Management,"Newark, NJ",Former Employee ,Customer Office: Management is the challenge,3,"* Recruiting is rigorous and well done. Most people in the organization are smart and motivated. They genuinely care about what they do and the people they work with. They value communication and sharing which is really important within a large organization.
*Office space is modern and teams are usually provided all the assets they need.
* Good opportunity for more junior people to gain experience
","* Culture of extreme micromanagement at the leadership levels.
* Every decision is second-guessed by management - on projects, team structure, policies. The smallest details are often the subject of drawn out debates by committee.
* Large shifts in project direction regularly occur, especially at the late stages
* Constant reorganization of leadership and teams leads to confusion and lack of process
*Semi-regular layoffs keep the entire organization on edge 
* Work/Life balance is a challenge - hours are long and you're expected to keep constant contact via email no matter what time of day or night it is.
* Politics and personality conflicts between leadership within the different business units is highly visible
Advice to Management
* Trust the people you hire to do their jobs
* Seriously rethink senior leadership structure within the Customer Office - culture starts from the top

Sat Jan 05 2019,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,In GBTS it depends on the team,0,"The flexibility in working from home is a nice option for days when you just don't feel like going into the office. The benefits are also decent and some of the team members are awesome. Some of the projects can be interesting and rewarding if you can give them enough focus.
","I was supporting a techbology that is usually managed by a team of 4-5 in similarly sized deployments with only one other person, and being paid about 25% below what Prudential lists as the lower end of market reference range for my level. The idea of expanding the staff was continually shot down even after pointing out impending burnout. I was on-call 24x7 getting paged overnight a couple times per week for months on end and got little support in managing the workload of dozens of projects. I had 4 different managers over about 2.5 years due to the team getting reorganized. Although the company does promote work-life balance at higher levels, in some areas this seems to be confused for letting people work from home whenever they want even without actually letting them unplug outside of business hours.
Advice to Management
Pay attention to and provide more support for employees who tell you the workload is burning them out. Make sure the infrastructure projects that free up time for the more interesting and wider benefiting projects can get appropriate priority. Lower the tolerance for people who are not qualified for their positions to free up slots for the teams who desperately need more people.

Please look into your Financial Professional Associate training program to make sure it is what you want it to be. The initial interview was informative and, had what I was told would happen (ie. guidance, training, and follow up) it would have been an awesome opportunity.

Tue Oct 23 2018, Financial Advisor,"Honolulu, HI",Former Employee ,ESCAPE WHILE YOU STILL HAVE YOUR DIGNITY,16,"- You’ll get very good at cold calls, living on very little money, giving product presentations, and parking in tiny stalls

- More initial support for new hires than many other insurance sales companies
","- They’ll tell you you’ll make $100k+ a year, but you find out later that less than 5% make it past the first four years. You’ll eat dirt for those four years before you can even afford instant noodles, let alone rent. Be prepared to have your gf walk out on you when you have to move back in with your parents 

- Home office turns a blind eye to sexual harassment if the perp makes them enough money; they’ll just give you the number for their internal therapist and tell you not to talk about it to save their reputation (they’ll also take about two months just to address your concern)

- Never seen a company this prominent be so disorganized. They will lose your client’s checks, put client monies into other clients’ accounts, lose forms, etc., and of course it ends up being your problem not theirs. Don’t bother complaining to upper management, they’ll just lose that too

- There isn’t much training beyond the initial phase. The only way to learn how to do your job is to give experienced agents a cut of your business.

- People don’t really know much about financial planning or their products, or anything really (yup, even the experienced agent that you just gave 50% of your parents 401k rollover to). They just tell you what the person above them told them to say

- You’ll soon learn that “Financial Advisor” is synonymous with “Salesperson without a college degree” and that the CFP was created by the insurance industry to justify selling life insurance. 

- They’ll promise you refunds for things such as classes, then change the rules after your requests were already approved. On that note, they’ll also “forget” to pay out bonuses such as recruiting bonuses, then tell you that you no longer qualify for them

- After a while you end up seeing people as dollar signs and forget social interaction is for anything other than selling them stuff they don’t really need. Your friends and family might stop answering your calls a few months in

Once around april and once right before Christmas. You are given 2 months notice at least. I thought this was a great company until I got into it. Directors are great to talk to.

","Swept under rug when it comes down to it
Advice to Management
Do not offer a position to someone, pay them to get trained and toss them if they’re struggling without even offering additional training or another position within the company that will better suit them. It doesn’t make sense to invest in an employee then not think twice about them when the company says so.. Especially if they’re a really great employee and receives constant recognition and feedback. It’s not fair to anyone and I know of multiple people that this has happened to. It’s a great company to work for overall but from personal experience of working very hard and being tossed away like the work put forth in your company didn’t matter, it’s a bitter feeling. At least assist employees with finding another position or allow them to apply and give them another chance! I’ve applied for a dozen positions since I’ve been tossed away and I’m qualified for every single one yet for some reason I’m not even being considered again.... HR and hiring department also needs to know this. Very disappointed and giving up. You lost a very valuable and dedicated employee.. I’ll be sharing my experience with all of my colleagues.

-Flexible work schedule meaning you can come and go as you please, work as much or as little as you want* (See cons as well)
-Great incentives to do as best as you can such as trips and bonuses
-Others and willing to help you as much as possible and make sure you succeed* (See cons as well)
-Unlimited leads from past advisors who have left, leaving numerous accounts in limbo that have not been contacted in years, this means money making opportunity
-Reimbursement for upfront expenses
","-Do not expect to take a day off your first year. If you do, expect to hear about it from your ""managers""
-During pre-contract, you need to have 2 hours every Friday set aside for a conference call that is essentially just a waste of time talking about what you and everyone else did during the week and if you didn't meet their expectations, be ready to get hammered in front of everyone.
-Do NOT believe a recruiter if they tell you that you will make over $100k your first year. You do not have the product or market knowledge off the bat to make this. The only exception would be that you already have a year or two experience in the industry.
-Do not have a job while acquiring your licenses or else you will be hammered for not advancing fast enough.

Recruiters, stop bringing in as many people as possible and start finding quality people. Consider starting a pre-FA training position that teaches to the test, the industry as well as the company.

Advice to Management
Dated and limited mentality and technology, incompetent leadership that relies on a mafia management style. Culturally challenged as a result of leadership’s management style and aggressive risk appetite. To many layers, bureaucracy, and unnecessary politics focused on blame games rather than solutions.

Hire and empower ethical leaders and staff with experience. Then focus energy on support and remove legacy roadblocks. Refocus to avoid practice of catering to a select group across front and back office, it’s limites growth potential and demonstrates poor risk management. Foster an open transparent environment to stimulate organic growth and dilute concentration to get at the root problem. Set a cohesive strategy,

Thu Mar 29 2018, Financial Professional,,Current Employee ,"If you don't want to make money for two years, this is the job for you.",9,"*COMMISSION ONLY* Coming on as an experienced advisor having all my licenses I was under the impression I'd be handing many hot leads and marketing material to get a jump state on making great money. I left my job making $75K because they told me that I'd be making six figures my first year with my experience and how many ORPHAN account they have. In my first 3 months I have made $1500 and had to pay them $300 per month for office space and $500 for E&O insurance. So I basically broke even. I just left the company because the money just isnt there if you don't come on board with a book of business and people you know that will buy life insurance sorry but you're screwed plain and simple. They give you a bunch ORPHAN accounts that you can call but 90% they don't pick up, the number is bad or there is no email on file. Then they expect you to purchase Intellius.com to stalk the clients to find a good number. When you do get in touch with a client they expect you to get an appointment by telling the client they only have little time to convert their policy to a permanent policy even if the conversion doesn't come due in 5-10 years! You're going to have clients bail on you all the time drive your car all over your state and waste time! I'm sorry I wasted 3 months here and leaving my $75K job! At least I found something better and I never do write reviews but I had to get this out there so hopefully you won't make the mistake I made.

PROS: Good team that really wants you to succeed but have limited resources to do so.
-They pay and sponsor your licenses. You should get them and leave.
-Work on you own schedule
","MANY MANY CONS!

-Commission ONLY
-Pay for office space and insurance
-Drive your car all over your state
-Only ORPHAN leads that are terrible
-Marketing is terrible
-You're basically cold calling
-Sell life insurance to people that already have life insurance.
-Going to clients homes (NASTY) Most clients are dirty people.
-If you don't mind cold calling all day and night over and over, then this job is for you.
-Very boring and dry place to work.. Not exciting at all.

Base salary for the first 2 years would be a huge start.

Bonuses tend to be small; with the exception being PGIM - whose pool is extremely large relative to other divisions. Avoid Group Insurance, and the Roseland buildings, at all costs if possible….

","The hiring process is very misleading, recruiters don't outline all the risks associated with this career. Like I depleted all my savings completely, emptied all my credit cards and eventually stooped down to being completely broke and had to file for a bankruptcy after a year of working with Prudential, and this is not my personal issue because 9 out of 10 hires left the company within the first 3 months. And although Prudential keeps praising itself nonstop (they are very proud of their ""ethical"" culture and great team) but in fact it turns into a nightmare for non experienced advisors who struggle to survive. Actually they got sued for that approach in multiple class action lawsuits, which I've been a part of, so be prepared for blatant lie!!! Over the course of my employment I signed up almost all my friends and family members for their services and products (the same happened to the majority of my coworkers) and most likely these people'll remain the clients of the company because of the famous name of the brand Prudential. So it's a very smart business model when they don't really care about huge turn over and personnel retention because every new hire brings new piece of business to the company and Prudential doesn't invest much in their advisors compared to the stream of income they bring to the firm.

Mon Dec 18 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Investment Operations Associate,2,"It was a great experience to have straight out of college. The title was a fancy way to say, back office operations. If operations and reporting is where you see yourself, then this is the job for you. Prudential is split into groups, and each group has several teams. It gives you the opportunity to rotate throughout your group, and learn all the different roles.
","I was taught that it is good to get your foot in the door with a big company to gain some experience and than more internally for the job that you want. I realized quickly that it is difficult regardless if you're looking internally or applying out to different opportunities. Although there are several groups and teams, you are stuck within the operations group, just getting a different learning experiences with each role. So if you're someone who learns early on, that operations is not for you - it is very difficult to transfer to a different group.
Advice to Management
Understand your employees interests. I started my career in operations, but found that I had a real interest in systems and technology. If management paid better attention, they would see that they could use this interest, and combine it with the knowledge I've gained, and help create better processes for the group. Instead, they did not offer anything besides operations and forced me to look for new opportunities outside Prudential.

Flexible schedule 
Decent people
At the very least you can get your foot in the door here fairly easily
","Prudential Advisors represent everything wrong with the financial services industry today. If you’re looking to get started in wealth management or financial planning this place should be your last resort. The job function of advisors at this firm is just to sell as many Pru life insurance policies as possible, which is why they require advisors to obtain the series 6 instead of the series 7. The entire business model creates conflicts of interest as you are incentivized to sell products rather than give sound advice. I spent my first year of employment there and did not see one single advisor write a financial plan, all of the revenue was generated by insurance/annuities and since the job is 100% commission the only way agents get paid is selling products. Their investment advisory platform was not competitive at all which made getting wealthy clients impossible. The result is that the most significant portion of recurring revenue comes from agents writing car insurance so essentially the company is giving the title of financial advisor to insurance salesmen.

The initial training isn’t too terrible, but once you become full-time (which happens after selling 5 policies) you’re essentially on your own. Pru likes to boast about their on going training however what they call training is bringing in a few wholesalers to tell the agents that their new products are the best in the marketplace. You never really learn the financial planning process.

Employee turnover is discouraging as well. The industry as a whole has an issue with this but Pru takes it above and beyond. I asked for them to pay for my series 65, 7, and first course of the CFP and management responded by saying that since those licenses/designations aren’t required they would only offer reimbursement. So you essentially are paying out of pocket for a job that is paying you nothing. The firm also has no education requirement for their advisors other than the initial licensing, which is partly why they cannot attract and retain talent. 

Lastly the lead program is a travesty. One of the major selling points of the job was the fact that Pru would provide their advisors with leads. The leads that were given out were either 90 year old clients who don’t want to be bothered, or clients who want to cancel the policy but haven’t been able to get ahold of an agent for years (because the salesperson quit within a month of selling the policy). Building your book is completely on you and since most of the new reps who come in through the CDP program are new grads with a ton of student debt it’s virtually impossible to get started. As a result you will be forced to hound friends and family by offering them expensive products to try and start your business.
Advice to Management
Management will not heed any advice. All the managers at the Pru Office swear that nothing in financial services has changed, citing their own experience and success as examples, meanwhile they haven’t produced in years. So they’re advice to new reps is “smile and dial” and remember that “life pays the bills” meaning that in order to make a decent wage you better be selling high premium policies.

However in reality everything has changed. The DOL has really hindered how insurance firms conduct retirement business, financial technology is changing the way Advisors connect with clients and build solutions, and independent RIAs are starting to dominate the market share, capturing talented advisors and adopting the latest fintech to interact with clients. The days of cold calling and selling products are dying while planning and advice is coming to the forefront. The result is that large firms are going to have to decide what their goals are do they want to be in the business of managing wealth and financial planning, or do they want to build and sell their products? For Prudential it may make more sense to focus on selling their products through other channels.

Wed Dec 20 2017, Financial Advisor Associate,,Former Employee ,Awful Pay and misleading recruitment process,6,"You can put that your have financial advising experience with prudential and people will believe it as they are a somewhat respected company. In reality, the training is non-existent and no one has time for you.
","They say you make your own schedule but they require you to be in the office for nine hours worth of meetings a week on top of the after hours they make you stay for. They say they have unaligned clients (clients whose advisors have left) which is true but those clients already have multiple policies and do not want to hear from you as they have already heard from other new employees. They expect you to call all of your friends and family multiple times over. It doesn’t matter if they say no. They will tell you that the company average for a first year employee is 70k but only one new Professional Associate ( 0-4 yr old prudential advisors) out of 30 make more than 70. The rest make 40 K and under. The retention rate during my year was 10%. Due to this, the office is dead. You can hear a pen drop in there. In other words, the office environment is awful. 

They will tell you that this is the same for most offices but I haven’t found this to be true. They only pay commission. And do not care how much you make after you get 5 clients because the managers don’t have to pay prudential a fee if you quit after that. If you are looking for a career opportunity where others genuinely care about you, invest in you, and foster growth this is not the place for you.

Hard work, but they will put in equal amounts of hard work into you.
Earnings are basically unlimited (dependent on individual sales), with generous bonus structure.
Benefits are great, including 401k, pension, health, dental, among much more.
","Pay is commission only. While they put money into a ""pool"" to make sure you get paychecks over a period of time, it is all dependent on actual production, with no base salary. Not necessarily a con, but not for everyone.
Again, not necessarily a con, but at least at the beginning, requires more than a typical 9-5 schedule. Make your own schedule, which has its benefits, but must be structured, and often requires work into the evenings as you work to build up your book of business (though not necessarily required).

","This review is for group insurance located in Roseland, NJ. They have been laying off and firing employees age 50+. Management would give a review but will provide negative comments to put you on probation and then fire you and will not change the comment even if it is proven false. The review is the company's documentation and it will be your word against their word. Believe this ADEA violation, but they throw in someone that is under 40 so that it will not be called age discrimination. Those employees that are removed have been in the company a long time and have greater knowledge than the college hire replacements. This all has to do with the bottom line as they have high expenses and need to trim expenses by end of 2017. They make employees work longer hours so that they can hire fewer employees and inexperience employees. Company states great work/life balance. Not the case as employees are working 10-12 hours a day and on weekends. Management expects the employees to complete all the work by unreasonable deadlines. However, no management is working late which causes employees be disgruntled. (If management expects employees to work late at night, set an example and do the same thing.) Beware that there is no promotions. If you work hard you will still have to post for the higher level job if it comes available. Also, non exempt employees (college grads) are working more than 40+ hours per week should be paid time and a half. based on Fair Labor Standard Act. Instead, management will give non exempt employees straight comp time and no overtime pay. Also, notice their are less minorities in Roseland.

Wed Aug 02 2017, Financial Advisor,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,You must pay them if you leave your job as an Advisor- rip off alert.,35,"I met some good people almost all have moved on to better jobs.
","Want to be an Advisor say no to this company, they send you an invoice after you leave. 

I am a 22 year veteran in the industry, I worked for this firm for 16 months the last 4-5 seeking a new situation. If you want to learn the business not here, if you have experience, do it anywhere but here. 
I produced, followed the rules, was promised management within 6 months with the kind of resume I had I was told that management would be an absolute in 6 months. The old bait and switch occurred, I got there and I produced as asked and exceeded the expectation, when I asked when would l I be moving to a managers role they changed the criteria and rules. I continued to produce and expand my practice. 
I trained every new person because the managers hire and abandon people, they have a ridiculous recruitment goal and no real incentive to develop their hires. I am mentoring/training people and continued producing very well. Despite the company mantra. “life pays the bills” meaning life insurance I was working on some life insurance and annuity cases but a lot of investment business which takes about 10 times longer to get done because they are not and will never be investment oriented as a firm. They only put in a CRM in 2016 because the DOL ruling forced their hand, they put in the most rudimentary version of Salesforce in place and expected all of us to stop production to enter clients, they could have hired data entry people for this at $12 an hour. This company has more ways to prevent you from doing business such as endless mandatory meetings, requests for data entry, endless training's in which they bring in someone who pontificates for 75 minutes and has not produced in years. Managers that are doing unscrupulous replacement of life insurance policies to produce commission for their hires and then they just stop that faucet flow after a few cases and leave them to call upon over worked brutalized clients that have had 5 Advisors in 3 years. Or they have them calling friends and family to buy insurance. Most of the managers that I met had so many issues/complaints on FINRA Broker Check you should never let them see your clients some even had assault and sexual assault reported on the criminal section of their FINRA File.

Now here is the fun part, I decide I cannot work in the environment and I decide to leave, I am still producing because I have to get paid (this is all commission), I finally give notice and have smartly planned to have only $2800 left in my draw account. I am told that I would have to wait FOURTEEN WEEKS after my last day to receive my final paycheck. I am not happy but I wait, well 15 weeks go by and I call payroll to be told that I misunderstood, I will get a letter that is mailed after FOURTEEN WEEKS telling me what my paycheck would be and then I will get it on the next payroll date. I wait and the letter arrives 16 weeks after my last day. AND….
It tells me I owe Prudential $1958.22. There is a redacted statement explaining the inflow and charge backs for any advanced payment on commission that I had after I left the company. Funny thing is not one thing matched the spreadsheet that I produced for myself before I gave notice, not even close to the numbers I had, I called payroll and asked them if I sent them a blank piece of paper and it said, “send me $1958.22” would they send me a check? They said no, of course not, I asked them why they expected anyone to do just that? I had to ask four times for them to give me a deeper explanation and you would think they were giving me the launch codes for the nuclear arsenal. The information was still not enough to understand how I owed them money. I tried to reason with them and then I get a call from a law firm in Arizona trying to collect on me. So, my legal coverage at my new job is not fighting them for me, they also had to ask 7 times to get the contract they were reading because nowhere in the contract that I had did this little nugget appear and we still can’t find it because they refuse to send the document. So how do I owe them money and how did this happen? These slick managers call the clients tell them they have to see them, tell they that you left and they need new paper work signed. They get the cases assigned to… you guessed it some new hire that needs the commission to fulfill their obligation to get hired on contract. How do I know this? Someone that I am friends with in my old office was told this by a new hire who got other peoples cases. 
In my entire working life of over 35 years I have never ever been asked to pay for the privilege of working for a company. Especially a company that does not give me a paycheck, it is all commission, there is no expense reimbursement so all your gasoline, tolls and wear and tear on your car is your bill to carry. You can write it off however, you know that will never recoup all of the out of pocket. The benefits are so-so and expensive. In year two they throw you into a 1099 contract, you are entitled to benefits, 401(k) and they pay FICA but you are responsible for your own taxes. I saw 75-year-old agents still working there because they could not retire. Just the other day one of the young people that I mentored called me, he received a $300 invoice in the mail for his short 9 month stay at Prudential.
They troll the internet, college campuses and job fairs, do not fall in the trap or you will go broke and owe them money in the end.

Wed Jul 19 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Accounting,4,"Looks good on a resume.
","Pay was low, had to pull teeth on initial offer to get something marginally decent. 

Pru advertises a really awesome culture & values system; I didn't quite see this culture or value system ever be embodied or realized in day to day business interactions within the company.

Mostly due to corporate politics being at a nearly toxic-level. Petty, combative, and counter-productive environment when dealing with other departments. Have never encountered a place like this in my career....ever.

Too many managers, not enough workers.

Assigned expectations and responsibilities well beyond pay grade and description, which required excessive overtime to complete duties.

If you're lucky enough to realize you need to hold your ""reports to"" manager accountable for delivering on career-progression promises and timelines early on, there may be hope to progress and negotiate... that is IF you can simultaneously deal with the bureaucracy and Corporate-insanity politics that exist within this company. 

You will be placed on a career-track that will not acknowledge your credentials, work-ethic, and quality of work until you've earned whatever the deemed ""time-frame"" of that internal tracker should be. 

Hard work and merit don't matter here folks; it's all about how much time you've been with the company before anyone with power will *tangibly* acknowledge your value via pay/promotion, and put the title and money where their mouths are, UNLESS you're initially hired at a high level or executive level position to start.
