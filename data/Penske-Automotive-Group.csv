Advice to Management
Have a clear pathway to a living wage for technicians fresh out of tech school who have to simultaneously work for you and afford their tools and tuition payments. $14/hr starting to work on BMWs on a split schedule while having to start from scratch with tools and consistently attend brand training was stressful, demoralizing and impossible to live on in New Jersey. I was laid off due to COVID-19 but had frankly lost faith in the job well beforehand and will not miss it. The lack of qualified technicians at present is as much a matter of shops not having a dedicated apprentice system to accommodate new techs as it is older techs retiring.

The sales people haven’t been given a raise in over a decade they’re still using the same pay plan from 10 years ago at least. You get one vacation day your first year and only 8 day the second year. They don’t even have the decency to give you 2 full weeks your second year. The finance department is a train wreck. They’re constantly at one another’s throat and belittle the sales people. The new CEO told us if we want to raise we should sell more cars. Novel idea. I’m already working over 50 hours a week and sell almost 30 cars per month how about you pay us more per car since you haven’t changed it in over 10 years. Or here’s another idea how about you pay us for the first seven cars we sell. They actually do not pay you for the first seven cars you sell in the and next 8 through 14 they only give you $100 per car. The place is a joke.

Wed Dec 19 2018, Sales Associate,"Tenafly, NJ",Former Employee ,Billon Dollar company with McDonald's Vision,2,"Literally Nothing. Was off on Sundays, That was the only good thing.
","If you want to work for a company that's run by Managers who don't know their left hand to right hand then this is the place for you. It was literally a playground. Managers who were on a power trip doing what they felt like without any discipline. A lot of great coworkers left and the Management team could care less. The pay? let me just say you'll make more flipping burgers at McDonald's. The pay was peanuts and an embarrassment for a multi billion dollar company like Penske. When you win a Christmas gift from a raffle they tax you for it, that's how greedy this place is. (Never seen that in all my working years) My team was great but it seemed to me that most people here were really grumpy and didn't like their job or didn't bother doing their job. Everyone was in each others business. Most of the staff had tension with each other and a lot of people didn't talk to each other. The weekly staff meetings were really toxic due to that nature. The Management team, 2 out of three aren't competent to run a dealership in my and the customers opinion. Leadership starts from the top of the pyramid. If you want to be lied too, overworked, not appreciated, payed peanuts, degraded, work for this company. you've been warned!
Advice to Management
Step down and do the right thing. You can lie to everyone but eventually the truth will come out. End the power trip and focus on developing the team. Get your head together and lead as an example. Don't sit back and just watch the show. Be proactive and engaging on the sales floor.

Independents, mom and pop dealers, small family dealership groups, and larger corporate dealership groups. I was a shop foreman for 14 years of my career. I had peaked and was burnt out.

HR should be accessible and connected to the organization, not in an unknown location in a secure building.

Advice to Management
Get it together. Pay people what they're worth, especially when dealing with automobiles with prices starting out at 100K+. Don't demand people work over an 80 hour work week and not pay them over time. Especially once they've hit 95-110+ hours. Make sure people are accommodated with their lunch breaks. Weeks on end of working open to close without a break is unacceptable. It's not their fault you can't hire people to fill seats. Make the workplace a positive place. Actually pay attention to your employees and set them up in the beginning to succeed. Train them and walk them through what they're doing so they get it correct. Don't just write them up for every mistake they make and expect change when you can't even provide the information to ensure it doesn't happen again. Let them get certified in the brands they're working. Make sure you have a full staff of people that are catered to that job. Don't take people away from their work to fill in for another department because, again, you can't fill the positions. Accept your employees faults as your own. It's your job as a manager to ensure everyone is getting along. Their failure is your failure. Stop seeing it any other way. Accept critiques and make improvements. When one department tells you your department is slacking, making it out to seem that the other departments are wrong is wrong. Talking negatively about other departments because your department is falling apart is ridiculous. Teamwork makes the dream work, right? Treat employees fairly across the board and stop picking favorites. The clique situation I've never understood. We're not children and we're all there for the same reason. 

If you're looking for a place that will work you to the bone, that will demand a spot in your life ahead of your family, paycuts, pay-deductions, negative environment, unfair treatment, unbearable workload, taking blame, being made to feel guilty, never doing enough, etc... Then go right ahead. 

**Directly to Penske himself, stop stepping on the people holding your company together. Reassess your work place. Reassess your managers. Stop catering to your sponsors and start catering to the people that keep your companies alive. I wouldn't expect a man who built a museum for himself to understand that. But, it's time to pull your head out of the sand. 

This place was a god awful nightmare. I wouldn't recommend anyone work here. Its almost a joke. An extremely sad joke. You can't treat people this way, pay them what they're being paid, work them the way you work them and expect gold. 

I could write a book on this place and I still couldn't say all of the horrible, unethical and probably illegal things I've seen there.

Managers are held accountable for unwanted turnover, so there is a lot of emphasis on making the employment experience good.
Doubled their 401k employer match a couple of months ago, probably the best in Automotive, but not sure.
It's a publicly traded company, there is a huge focus on ethics, which is really important, people have good job security, and as opposed to many other automotive dealer groups, you don't run the risk of losing your job because someone in a position of power gets mad and decides to throw you to the gutter. 
I have been with the company for six years, didn't really know much about them, but once I got on board, I discovered it is a solid company.
Money is important to me, and they have given me raises consistently, and particularly as the market and my performance warranted it.
Last but not least, I have an outstanding boss, and that is as important to me as the money.
","Honestly, the expectations are high, and the workload can be heavy at times, but if you are a strong performer / producer, they take care of you. If you are not a strong performer, this probably isn't the right company to work for.

I have been working at Penske Automotive Group full-time for more than a year
Pros
It's hard to find accommodating, supportive companies to work for in this industry, but Penske definitely goes above and beyond to be the best. They have the best benefits and work environment that I've seen in the business. Proud to be a Penske employee!
Cons
It is a retail environment, so be prepared to work weekends and a minimum of 40-50 hours. Salespeople get 2 days off per week and management is accommodating when requested.

","Management without heart. Did not feel valued as an employee, felt like just another number, worked hard but no reward, HR was horrendous and a joke. Stressed environment, cheap cheap cheap. They will try to get all they can out of you and even the upper management was kept in the dark on many things, not to mention extremely stressed as well. A cold corporate environment that did whatever it took to make money without caring about quality of life of employees. Stay away if you are smart and want to enjoy life.
Advice to Management
Stop being so out of touch. Employees aren't going to be loyal if you continue to treat them so POORLY and don't reward them for their work. These are the people who you should attempt to make happy because in turn they will have motivation to make the customers happy. Miserable employees will lead to miserable customer experiences. Listen to your employees and managers and have some heart, encourage transparency, actually encourage it, don't just say you encouragement it when you don't really mean it. Bring in some organizational psychologists and start healing the company, its wicked to be all about money when it comes at the expense of the quality of life of employees. It is so silly to treat the ones out there doing the work interacting with the customers like trash, as they are the real heart of the operations and their dissatisfaction will spread to all aspects of business eventually.

","While penske is a decent company to work for, getting proper management seems to be a challenge, as well as keeping stores fully staffed. In an ever growing industry such as the automotive industry, the need for updated ways to enhance a customers experience is constantly over looked. Dealerships are always seen as selling cars, while service is seen as a dread to deal with. Service is what keeps the business growing, but is left behind each year. Never having the budget to get updated systems to make service advisors, techs, and managers lives easier at work. A simple update in printers, or a system to quickly check in cars and check service history would help alot, but are always denied.

","NO JOB SECURITY! Your future lies in the hands of stock holders on wall street deciding how many people need to be hired/fired on a monthly basis to ensure the stock stays high. It is very important to meet your sales quota, if not slightly exceed it. Even though exceeding quota means your quota the next month goes up, even during historically slow months. Managers sometimes schedule 6 or 7 10-hour days in a row, instead of hiring one or two more sales reps. This causes the whole sales team to be very tired, ineffective, and a lot of my coworkers were constantly wired on Red Bull and cigarettes.
