Fri Feb 05 2021, Director,"Benton Harbor, MI",Current Employee ,"Great values, with opportunities to grow",0,"The company has great values, people really are friendly, and open to learn. There are pockets of innovative teams that really can make a difference. 
The industry is changing and there are opportunities to rethink many part of the business. The global reach of the company is a bonus. 
Your role could be a great place to build a legacy and drive impact.
There is a strong effort in building inclusion and diversity, more talent has been brought in. Some of the strong leaders stand up for what is right and the openly speak about how the company is making an impact in society. 
When projects are collaborative in nature it really brings out the best of the company. 
The campus is a great place that feels like home. 
There are opportunities for personal growth and the company supports it's employees.
They invest in various key areas and creative initiatives that long-term provide and overall better corporate experience. While the company has been around a long time, most recent initiatives have made it feel young again.
","There's still too often tendency to make the safe choices and avoid taking too much risk. Some great initiatives or projects take a long time to get funded or do not make it to full execution, too many great ideas die in business case reviews.
Overall management of change and getting everyone aligned is a struggle at times, mostly because it feels like not every function or region is fully integrated.
The planning and project cycles while very well structured are not always understood and can sometimes take too long to gain traction.
Some of the executive management could be more engaged to actually learn what is happening. There are some pockets of departments that are slow moving or too closed off from the rest of the company and other pockets can feel like a closed network for promotions or influence.
HR and IT can be weak in effectiveness at the execution level
Advice to Management
Build in more risk-taking that is smart and supports innovation. Get out of your comfort zone.
Find ways to leverage and expand the best practices by the most innovative teams and people regardless of function or role. 
Invest in more top talent and those that can balance technical innovation with agility
Build and integrate the organization so all regions are better aligned
Develop leaders that know how to drive a more agile approach and do not rely only on what they know from experience, there's too much copy and paste in some leadership roles.
Stay friendly and true to the values but also do not be afraid to challenge, build new structures, or rethink completely to improve overall effectiveness.
Do not forget to build talent within

","very very poor management, lots of mandatory overtime (they say they're all for family, however, I never see my husband or our 4 yr old son who spends more time with family members who have a 9 to 5 job or at the daycare which I pay out the butt for so bye bye over time pay. the health insurance is the bare minimum so as to keep them out of trouble with the govment. the amount of work expected is insane, and they say you get goal share every 3 months if every person meets the criteria but yet we haven't seen more than $80 in 2yrs! they change the criteria all the time making it harder and harder to get. like what the heck. when I first started 4 yrs ago it was over $300! 16 yrs ago when my spouse started it was almost $1000 and 25 yrs ago it was in the $2000 range. now it's $80?? they act like they're going out of business. like they are broke! but 10 products we make on each line covers the wages and the energy to make it including material for the entire shift! and we make almost 2000 a day on just my line, 7 lines are making 1500 or more products a day at my factory. they recently took away the retirees health insurance these people worked almost 30 yrs or more for this company! they are nickle and daming us and people say if you don't like it leave. so many people have left it has gone from a good solid company to work for to new people all the time. its now a revolving door company. and at a starting pay of 18$ an hour with full benefits from day one you would think who would leave a job like that especially at there top pay of 22$ an hour almost 23$. they pay makes it hard but between the management and the constant poor treatment by policies and an impossible chance of moving up unless you are bff with management (trust me I've tried with a college background in the area i wanted they went with a family of the supervisor who had less time and zero experience in the area who is by the way doing a very poor job) honestly some of these jobs should at least have some organizational and people skills not to mention leadership skills that most of these leaders are lacking. come on whirlpool what happened to family? what happened to employee pride? what did the heck happen to a desire to not just make a product but to become a company that someone was proud to work for? what happened to you whirlpool?
Advice to Management
first off treat employees that put the time in and paid their dues to you better! second invest in learning about employees' moral! if your people love you and the work they do they will not only sell your product for you, they will help bring new people in that will do a good job and want to stay. stop trying to buy us with broken promises and giving us cheap broken toys (health insurance is the lowest of the law) educate your people. about your product, about your future goals. don't just say this is the way it's gotta be, say this is why we are choosing this way and how it is better than the last way. the CEO needs to come in and say bare with us guys we got some growing pains or the economy just had a hit and we need to work together to get through it. get a freaking motivational speaker is there to help you say what you need to say and this is why. 1. your employees make your product! if they are unhappy they don't care what you pump out or how much of it is incorrect. this travels down the line to the consumer and in the end, could really hurt your bottom line. you can say we make a good product together all you want. but an unhappy employee will always make a poor product. they will stay for the pay but they won't give their all. its basic psychology 101. 2. provide better health insurance then just the bare minimum. if your employees have to work sick or with the stress of healthcare cost on their mind then their mind is busy even at work and there not giving you their full time. its a paycheck and while you all do pay really well (thank you for that by the way) if their entire paycheck is working to just get them by then well.. 3. id put something hear but well you have tons of people with degrees that work for you and I am sure they have tried to give advice or whatnot and you brush them off just like you do with everything else that you see happen in the workplace you should know most of this stuff.

- Layoffs every 12 - 18 months (i.e. really poor management of business fundamentals, and used as an excuse to elimate political opponets)
- Extremely siloed (Though leaders claim it is not true)
- Nearly all projects are pet projects. Results in project cancelations or starvation when a person moves to a new role or out of the company. Lots of wasted $$$
- HORRIBLE Leadership practices. Leaders look for ""YES men"", build power bases, and fight other leaders
- Lots of wasted $$$. Leaders that are in 'favor' travel for vacations on company's dime. Those who are out of 'favor' can't travel for legitimate business reasons. - Departments constantly fight over projects, causing endless delays b/c of leader's egos. I know of at least 1 cooking project that is 5 years in development with at least 3 more years of development expected.

","Managers don't understand the jobs of their subordinates to a fault. In may situation we were tasked with an impossible job that was so far outside my training and scope of work that it couldn't be done. In the end, it cost the company $100,000 to upgrade software, buy new gear and cost additional $30,000 per year in software maintenance. When the manager's expectations were not met, we didn't get the bonus we normally got. This was all because they didn't understand the role. On top of that hot mess I had 5 different manager in 4 years. Each had a different style and did not have time to become ""One Whirlpool"" so they would be heavy handed they way were doing our job...based on the last manager...and the next manager would do the same thing. This cycle repeated over and over every year. The last year I was there I had 2 managers in one year. The latter didn't know how to do vacation time and work from home. It was a mess.
Advice to Management
Put people in place who understand the work being done. Stop with just managing processes and start bringing in people with backgrounds in the area you are hiring them in. For instance, Engineering should be managed by a qualified engineer, Sales, Marketing, Manufacturing, Field Service, Customer Service and on and on. Second you are working with PEOPLE not numbers. Machines do numbers, people are not machines. Pulling goals out of thin air as ""stretch goals"" are fine but when they are so far out there to be put against your bonus, that's wrong. One last thing is job performance. It's one thing to do GREAT work for the job you are given but to be judged and rewarded for work that's out of scope and beyond your job description is INSANE. People are being encouraged to work 2-3 other jobs or projects beyond their job function, meaning one will lag. You should be judged by the work you were hired to do. Currently doing the work you were hired to do is just satisfactory. You need to do volunteer work, be part of other teams, lead a project (not part of your work), create a project....in other words work like a dog for a bonus that may or may not be there for you because you got 3 instead of a 2 because management said we couldn't give out all the 2's that deserved it because leadership only gave us 4 twos to distribute. So people that earned a 2 got a 3 even when they did all the extra work. That system is broken and needs to end.

","This used to be a place that you could retire from. Those days are over (unless you are being offered an early retirement buy out). It is a company where you truly need to be moving up or moving out. Absolutely do not count on the annual bonus as a part of your compensation - no matter what HR tells you. In 14 years, there were maybe 2 years where it was at or above target (meaning company performance reduced the amount - sometimes drastically). Annual performance review process is complete garbage. Your performance and accomplishments ultimately do not matter. Your rating is always subject to two outside forces that you cannot control - first: rating distribution must meet the corporate bell curve, second: upper mgmt playing politics / favorites. 

Product development process is s - l - o - w. Think glacial. They've made many changes to it, and it's still slow. Maybe even slower than before. If they found a way to move faster, then this company might have a chance. Other wise.... good luck.

As a largely known manufacturer of some of the best appliances available in the market it should be no surprise that having a high employee turnover rate more often than not tends to reflect negatively on the company. You're easily recognized as the best in world-class Appliance Manufacturing. Your solid history and employees have afforded you multiple Best in Class brands. 
Along the way when a product was less than stellar, you had to analyse and rectify the situation. You know how to set the bar high for your competition so why not go above and beyond the normal. Analyze the ""why"" regarding employee turnover. Consider implementing a monthly or quarterly requirement of every manager, supervisor, and those with a role of authority that at least once monthly or quarterly step out pod their important position and do at least half a shift on the line. Fulfill the line duties, integrate with your peers etc. Become familiar with their opinions&feelings and their reasoning thereof. This will help to remain grounded in everyday work life knowing how and why things are as such. Then you can see that real change needs to occur. Pay rates are not optimal, benefits are good but there's always room to improve on anything you do. Take on a new challenge. A new way to lead.Why not take on the role of best in class employer? Rise to be the best! Make them changes and stand out.

The office environment is filled with a top notch workforce and management was always very flexible, supportive of remote work if needed. There are also decent career advancement opportunities if you learn how to navigate the political structure.
","Within the Strategic Sourcing group there was a severe lack of training and on-boarding processes. This lead to confusion regarding job responsibilities and needed outputs. Additionally, the organizational structure is a large, global matrix model with multiple managers seated around the world. This made it very difficult to collaborate and align on strategy. There was little understanding of regional differences which limited reaching a true global strategy. Lastly, Whirlpool lacks consistent processes, even between peers, which results in inefficiencies and disconnects. When trying to bring forward ways to continuously improve, I was met with the “this is just how Whirlpool does it” response. So the company is very slow in bringing on process improvement due to lack of management support and a legacy mentality.
Advice to Management
Whirlpool needs to train employees correctly and provide supporting teams/process to streamline role responsibilities. The global team structure needs to be revised to have a more regional touch with in country managers who can assist their employees real time. Lastly, Whirlpool seems to be terrible at workforce management, just hiring and then laying off as a quick solution to market changes. This is very damaging to employee moral and loyalty.

I have been working at Whirlpool Corporation full-time for more than a year
Pros
The location is great if you like a small town community feel and being near the beach. The pay is competitive with strong benefits. The people tend to be great to work with and teams feel close knit.
Cons
Project timelines are too short to do the work correctly so individuals are constantly strained to deliver quality at low cost while cutting corners. Layoffs every few years has left the company leaner than it should be, spreading recourses way too thin. Cost reduction targets are unattainably high and if you happen to meet it one year it’ll increase by 50% the next.
Advice to Management
Quit reducing resources. Before COVID, we were looking to hire a team member but were put on a hiring freeze and ended up losing one. Now the already lean team has to run 2 people down with no backfill in site. Also, your employees understand the market. When you tell employees for months in advance about a lay-off coming due to COVID and they see that EBIT is up year over year for Q2 and the stock jumps 8% in a day to be higher than Jan 2021, it’s not a good look for those strained resources or those who got laid off.

","Zero loyalty toward experienced employees, especially if you're over thirty, white, and male. No promotions except at the lowest levels. Management possesses no understanding of the technical side of the business, appearing to believe that employees exist in the world as interchangeable cogs. Layoffs, unheard of 20 years ago, now happen every three years, and loyal employees with decades of service unceremoniously find themselves kicked to the curb. I know of only one person the last six years who actually managed to retire on his own terms (without being forced into it). The company acts more interested in social justice than making quality appliances. I quit purchasing our appliances at employee discount several years ago, and plan to continue purchasing other brand appliances until I push up daisies. Everything gets sacrificed on the altar of share price, and those at the top continue to prosper while those at the bottom get treated like second-class citizens.

To reduce turnover rate I feel there needs to be more training on how to deal with verbally abusive and very rude consumers. Most of the young kids just out of high school do not know how to react when confronted by a disgruntled consumer, and after a few encounters they are ready to quit. Some do, right on the spot. I have seen it. They know they can go to a place like Target and get paid $13 to start (in TN) and not have to deal with it.

Advice to Management
I believe Whirlpool is a great corporation to work for. There are many opportunities and functions to grow within. However, I have concerns with the way we promote and judge our inside talent. I have tried many times to move to new roles with little success. I have two degrees: A Bachelor’s in Business Management with a double minor in marketing and communications; A Master’s Degree in Communications. I am in a level 8 role (non-exempt). I have consistently been rated highly on my PMP’s. The opportunities to move out of this role are very limited and almost non existent. However, I also see where we tend to bring in people from other regions or hire from the outside for leadership roles, leaving me to question why we are not promoting from within if we have top talent. I also question why non-exempt roles are not included in the 9 Box system? This all leads me to be confused with how we promote and hire.

","WCM Implementation, Senior Leadership and being forced to lie for WCM AUDITS
Advice to Management
The whole foot to the floor of WCM is destroying the middle management, salary ranks. Calling the teams Pillars is a joke at best. In the 90s and early 2000s, we called these 'silos' and worked hard at tearing them down as they DO NOT promote team work.

The amount of made up projects (AKA LIES) put on our big boards and sold to the auditors is disgusting!! I had to watch one pillar present a project for work I did more than 3 years ago. SERIOUSLY, MY WORK, MORE THAN 3 YEARS AGO SOLD AS A CURRENT PROJECT WITH DOCTORED INFORMATION. This is not an isolated event, but has happened consistently EVERY AUDIT SO FAR. Our audit score is truly based on LIES.

The reality of putting team members from different departments on kaizens sounds good in theory. The reality is, no one will help unless they 'get their cut' Unfortunately, it is more advantageous to just do projects by yourself. By the time you add a couple of people that provide minimal help, you have lost 20,30,40,50% of your kaizen, but you did 99% of the work.

I had multiple kaizens that people put their name on (without my knowledge) changed the font in the cell to white, so you couldn't see it on the screen. It pulled Hard Savings credit from me.

All the engineers now play the game and hold back TRUE/PRODUCTIVE/HELP FULL kaizens or improvements, because they have to give up too much of the credit to minimal contributors.

I had planned to retire from Whirlpool but am now looking for a new employer. Very Sad. 

Parts of WCM are really good. Its our approach that is killing the morale. In 8 years I have never heard so much talk of unionizing as I have in the last 3-6 months.

I no longer enjoy working here.

Advice to Management
keep in mind that genesys is still new, my class was the first to take calls on genesys, and the first class to sched everything OOW even if it is a month old and the first class for warranty neutral, so if you are a care advisor or up, please remember, you didn't have the same calls, things are not like you had them, and there is a lot of work to be done in relationships between customers, dealers servicers and manufactures,

- Great opportunities to build career and learn. Ability build technical knowledge is strong.
- Work life balance is good, and many will tell you family first.
","- Top managment is clueless about engineering. Only 1 senior leader is technical, and from what I could see not very skilled. The management side is definitely favored, they will keep the engineers necessary to maintain business.
-Bit of a new boys/girls club. Newer people, but a times can feel closed off if not part of the new leadership wave.
- Very processed focused. Believe that a process can fix all ills and lose sight of the importance of the people driving the projects. Can make you feel like just a number. (Oh and if you don't like the current process, just wait a 1-3 years and a new leader with a new process will come along)
- Company growth is through acquisitions. People will say they are risk adverse, but it is more than that. The company does try new things and there are opportunities to make something revolutionary in appliances; just look up vessi and zera. However, the cost to grow and nurture new ideas will never measure up to internal standards of viability in comparison to acquisitions.
Advice to Management
- Keep supporting technical growth.
- Support new initiatives, be patent with them and let the grow. Even if they do not have the full rate of return on investment.
- Stick to a process for more than 3 years.
- Try to not have so many different processes, only keep value added processes.
- Engineers should be kept to engineering.

Flexible work schedule depending on your manager. Use of Google suite makes connecting all over the globe easy and painless. Pay and benefits are on par with other large companies.
","Whirlpool claims to be a global company but behaves like a regional company that is very siloed within each region. Poor management at several levels! Many managers cannot walk their technical talk. Does HR check anyone's credentials? 
 HR is virtually non existent. Performance management is Success Factors but it is used inconsistently. Politics are ruthless and cut throat. Whirlpool had used forced ranking for many years and it shows in the culture. There is no onboarding for new hires. Turnover is very high. Reduction in force and layoff is common. Whirlpool has difficulty delivering on I.T. projects. The budgeting and financial tracking process project managers are required to follow is complex and inconsistent. There are multiple ""PMO's"" scattered around the organization each cranking out multitudes of processes for project managers to follow that appear to add zero value but create mounds of paperwork to keep everyone busy.
Advice to Management
Get a grip on your I.T. function! Give I.T. a voice and let your I.T. people do what they have been trained to do. You are hemorrhaging money around your software spend. Manage your software vendors and insure that they support what they sell and that their software performs as expected. Where is HR? The constant employee turnover has little to do with pay and benefits and a lot to do with management and culture. Get a consistent employee review process with manager/employee signoffs and stick to it. Follow industry standard I.T. and project management processes. (ie: SDLC, etc.)

","Current CEO Marc Bitzer seems to be trying to change the culture, but the damage done by his predecessor, Jeff Fettig, and his leadership team is everywhere.
 Employee evaluations still reward individual performance over teamwork, resulting in extreme organizational dysfunction. ""Bias for action"" rewards ""splashy"" decisions (even really bad ones) over thoughtful continuous improvement. High turnover and hiring from outside means most managers don't understand the function they're managing --- but if they present themselves well, they can move into another role before the truth catches up to them.
 Constant reductions in force (RIFs) force the survivors to ""throw issues over the wall"" and make them someone else's problem (or hope they'll just disappear) because there aren't enough hours in the day to resolve them. While outsourcing and offshoring produce some quick, short-term financial wins in the P&L, poor communication and the resulting inefficiencies are crippling day-to-day operations.
Advice to Management
Start developing and promoting (or hiring) real PEOPLE leaders, not self-promoting rockstars with impressive resumes who make a mess before quickly hopping to the next stepping stone on their career path.

I know several people who have left Whirlpool, and later were lucky enough to get hired back again. this is because people who think it's better on the other side realized what they had. Whirlpool is a massive old company and there I have a big problem with things like the inconsistency in the way information is presented on the company portal. Or the way beautifully redesigned cafe at the company headquarters charges ridiculous prices as if its not a company cafe. But these things are tiny relative to the much bigger considerations. Whirlpool is a fantastic place to work and there is no other way about it. And over the last 25 years, Whirlpool has become more attentive to teh things I care about...pay and flexibility. I am trusted to be independent and manage my own projects. As a result, I can sometime work remotely and shuffle work hours around. The only thing I would improve about flexibility is that I prefer to have a job where I don't even have a desk at the office. I have always been paid well and rewarded for extra effort. I don't have any other company experience to compare Whirlpool to....and I don't need it.

Advice to Management
It doesn't matter how much productivity or positive impact to the bottom line you think an individual will offer in a particular leadership role, if that person does not know the basics of collaborating and respecting other people, they should not work and Whirlpool and certainly not work in a leadership role. Unfortunately, I have seen several leaders at Whirlpool who are socially dysfunctional and it was no secret to anyone who worked with these people. This is confusing since the person who promoted them was aware of the personality that they were promoting. Unfortunately, I feel they were searching for expected results on paper, and not designing an optimized productive environment.

Good work life balance if you're in the right group/position. Although this is earmarked as a 5 year review, I have been here off and on for 21 years.
","Don't waste your time here if you're a white male, and especially if you're middle-aged. Promotions have been repeatedly put off, with the goal post always pulled just slightly further out of reach at the last moment, and the double standards for the selected favorites and the rest of the work force remain stark. For the record, I am far from alone in my feelings, though we don't dare openly voice these concerns for fear of reprisal and loss of employment.
Advice to Management
Cut the social justice nonsense and reward/promote based on merit. Measuring equality of opportunity by looking at the number of people from a selected ""group"" in various positions assumes a cause and effect relationship that fails to find backing anywhere in industry (research James Damore, formerly of Google, among others). Stop telling us ""There's No Right Way to Do a Wrong Thing"" while you're doing wrong things- and not just regarding your people management, but the quality of our products as well.

","Negative environment. Politics trumps process. Takes forever to get a good idea implemented. If you're a white male, unless you're Brazilian don't even think about getting a promotion. Outsourcing everything 'non-essential' and even some essential things, to the lowest bidder with no controls built into the contracts. So vendors can violate service level agreements with no consequences. Everything is amazingly politically correct, so if you step anywhere outside those boundaries, and aren't a favored employee, you're punished.
They love to talk about how they're giving people opportunities and how they're making a great product, but when it comes down to it, engineering is given a number to hit, costwise, and if they exceed it for quality, the brand will push back.

They recently (last year) went through a RIF, where they got rid of thousands of years of experience across the engineers. Literally, thousands of years. The institutional knowledge lost in that RIF will take years to replace.

Thu Jan 17 2019, Project Manager,"Benton Harbor, MI",Current Employee ,Continually evolving,6,"I have worked for Whirlpool for 11 years. During that time I have experienced multiple manufacturing locations, the technical side with Global Information Systems and even HR. The common theme is that everyone wants the company to succeed and meet our goals.
Whirlpool is great because there are opportunities to be a part of every facet of the business and they are willing to help you get there.
It sounds cliche, but the people really make the difference. Almost all of the people I work with are driven to make us successful and are willing to roll up their sleeves to make it happen.
","While it is good to move across the organization, it can be a very political process to move up through the organization. Some things that are expected to move up include: enough time in current role (over 1 year), solid back ground for the role you are applying for (can be difficult since this is a promotion), available space for your race/gender (white males have difficulty moving up since diversity is forced), personal connection to hiring group (must meet outside of the interview process).

This is a very large organization that is working to operate more globally. This means that there is much more work to make a change since you are working to align the updated standards with multiple regions. This may be a difficult shift for people coming from smaller companies.
Advice to Management
There have been multiple RIFs (Reduction In Force) over the last few years followed by multiple new hires. While it is good to refresh the organization, there are a couple other tools that could be better utilized.
Term limits for roles - Don't let someone stay in the same role for more than 4 years. This will challenge the employees to continually learn and improve.
Let people go - RIFs should not be the only time we make cuts. If we have poor performers, then give People Leader the tools/processes they need to let those people go (after you have tried to help them improve - PIP). 
Strive for equality, not for forced diversity. While minorities and race are easy to measure, it does not ensure diversity of thought. We do not want to trade one type of discrimination for another.

Let people go - RIFs should not be the only time we make cuts. If we have poor performers, then give People Leader the tools/processes they need to let those people go (after you have tried to help them improve - PIP). 
Strive for equality, not for forced diversity. While minorities and race are easy to measure, it does not ensure diversity of thought. We do not want to trade one type of discrimination for another.

Fri Dec 14 2018, Corporate Center Functions,"Benton Harbor, MI",Current Employee ,"Despite opportunities with diversity, a great place to work and grow a career",2,"Whirlpool Corporation is a family culture in conservative west Michigan. For the most part, the leadership cares about the employees and have good values. The culture really depends on the organization, but it ends up with a lot of great talent working in groups like engineering, supply chain, finance, sales and design. Marketing and HR groups have a harder time growing and retaining good people. 

The company has reasonable benefits to support families like maternity / paternity leave, domestic partner benefits, a childcare center. The facilites are a great design with open work concepts and the fact that every employee works in Google makes things open, collaborative, and fast-paced compared to being stuck in IBM or Microsoft systems. 

The diversity groups are pretty strong and consistent for women, LGBT, people of color and young professionals and the culture has evolved to be a really great place for young people to start a career even though it's in a small midwestern town. 

Perks of working for the company are great with discounts on awesome appliances and discount passes that can be shared with friends and family.
","Some of the next level leaders at the company have a culture of toxic masculinity. Leaders will say they are champions for the workplace and then year-over-year continue to only promote white, midwestern, men. It is a challenging place for women in the workplace not so much because of the policies but because of the culture. 

Sometimes it's an environment where the loudest voices in the room are heard simply because they are the loudest voices, not because they are the best strategic ideas. This leads the company to drive away diverse talent and causes all kinds of challenges for people from a different background or culture. It also fuels the culture where every few years teams are forced to lay off a percentage of their workforce. Instead of continuous coaching and development, managing out underperformers, and bringing in new talent, we seem to be in a cycle of layoffs every few years. 

Another con is that there is never a consistent way that employees are trained and developed, with the exception of the sales training or Leadership Development Programs. The general employees just have to fend for themselves, beg for resources for training, and hope they can find a leader who will be a champion for their career. 

Performance of the company has been challenging so in some years where there's a major lawsuit, raw materials prices, currency problems in Brazil, employees will get 1/4 or 1/2 of the bonuses that we would normally get. This can be frustrating so beware if there's a job offer with a bonus knowing that it could be significantly impacted by things beyond your control.

Culture definitely could use some work if Whirlpool Corporation wants to be a top destination for people to work from all backgrounds.

This company doesn’t know how to plan and therefore organizational changes and mass layoffs happen every year or two. This creates an atmosphere of fear and anxiety. 
There are good leaders that inspire change and hope, but they are dropping like flies and moving on to opportunities where they can make a difference without the politics.
No one seems happy, excited or passionate about their work, at least in my department. I can only speak for my group, but most days, the atmosphere is as dismal as a rainy, January day in southwest Michigan.
Advice to Management
Stop the bad behavior. You KNOW who the bad apples are, remove them and for goodness sake, please stop driving away strong women and leaders trying to help change the culture! This company feels like a good ole boys club where women are tolerated, because, you know, “diversity.” You will never attract and retain the right talent if this continues. But, on second thought, if management really wanted diversity in leadership roles, they would have made it happen already.

","Depending on what team you join, your life can be hell. Work life balance is non existent. While people can work from home, it is strongly frowned upon. People are expected to check email and do work late into the evening such as 10:00 pm or 11:00 pm. Emails also comes in the weekend and holidays so you need to be ready to reply back. If you come into the office at 8:00 am and have not checked your email at your home prior to leaving for work, you will be docked.
There is no structure or established processes from the team I'm at. Leaders talk about how important planning is but they don't plan for projects and it hurts everyone under them. The subordinates are the one who takes the fall and then are encouraged to find a different internal role to leave the team. These subordinates are then used as examples and talked about behind their back by that leadership. 
Everything is ""talk to this person"" instead of look at this SOP. No documentation anywhere. A good 20% of your time on most weeks are finding said people.
Going Google is also not good. It has small advantages such as collaboration on a document but added so much complexity when trying to work with vendors, scheduling meetings, organizing emails, and working on documents. There are more limitation then added functionality when compared to Microsoft. Be prepared to VPN in to access almost all systems Whirlpool has except emails. There's a reason Microsoft is the standard and the #1 enterprise suite. 
Training for your job? Forget it. Team will not give any incentive or voucher for self study for any professional certifications, workshop, or conference. These are reserved for a select few who also happens to know senior management.

Wed Sep 12 2018, Engineering Manager,"Benton Harbor, MI",Current Employee ,Immature Company,8,"Compensation is fair. Good career path available.
","Whirlpool doesn't have a clear on-boarding process. You feel 'thrown into' the company with little guidance (not manager based, HR-based). 

HR is very little help, instead of helping you they direct you to a website that doesn't actually answer your questions or help you get your job done. For example, I can't order a computer for a new employee starting next week, because HR won't give me the information I need (Employee ID number).

Whirlpool tries to implement good processes and falls short. The failure mode seems to be wanting a tool to solve the problem. Tools are tools, they don't solve your problems. People do. People need to commit, and the company needs to trust their people and hold them accountable. The trouble here is a lot of people in Whirlpool do not take responsibility for their work and deliverables.

Huge turn over rate. Very very low morale. Many people expect the company to fail or be bought.

The executive leadership often get in their own way. Initiatives change regularly, and there is little follow through, these changes seem to be based on whims and political fights, not market data. There is obvious infighting apparent to the first line of management and individual contributors at the executive level.
Advice to Management
Start acting like a World Class Global Corporation.
Follow through on initiatives.
Align on COMPANY priorities, and execute them. Each VP having different pet projects and ignoring cross-functional initiatives doesn't help the company.
Executives need to take responsibility for their organizations. They have the organization they developed and deserve. They can't blame the people in the org, it is the executive's behavior people are emulating. If they don't like a behavior in their organization, they should look at themselves first. Bad behavior from a VP is replicated at every level of the Org.

","Executives have lost their way. After 10+ years it no longer became fun to work for them. Top down management decisions were usually wrong creating the need to redo the projects. Because upper management meddled, there was no ROI on engineering and they decided to move most of it to India. They also do a people purge once every 18 months and older, higher salaried people are the first to go. They do this to keep up the wall street numbers because sales are falling so fast due to lack of innovation. It's gotten to the point where there is no more fat to trim. Indian workers are treated like slaves and the buildings are filled with Indians on nights and weekends. If they refuse they are sent home.

Tue Aug 28 2018,Anonymous,"Benton Harbor, MI",Former Employee ,"I loved my job, but WFM gave me panic attacks! Not worth it.",1,"I get to provide stellar Customer Service and work with people. Some Managers are absolutely wonderful to work for and make it worth going to work.
","The Corp doesn't appreciate 20 years of successful Public Relations, individual talents and skills. Do not help people or recognize people with disabilities and holds it against them. The worst time management systems (3 for one time card), 6 or more different forms must be submitted for every minute missed, made up, added, extra, vacation minute, changed, and system issue and end of week hours are always inaccurate and the department holds it against the employees from 18 years and up and will write them up or fire them for attendance issues based on a faulty system. Some Managers are bullys, harassing, discriminating, and unqualified to be a Manager (when they ask employees of 6 months the ""How To"" on several occasions then they are under-qualified). No oversight or checks and balances. Lies and blame before accountability. Inefficient training with HIGH expectations set employees up to fail.
Advice to Management
If Whirlpool is wondering why attrition is low, point to WFM. Be accountable and stop using bugged software or incompatible software programs to measure an employee's attendance or ability. Put Payroll or Time management Certified in Requirements in your want ads. Spend 3 days of training on Timecards, time management, Math or how to calculate your work time. Audit the employee's time for mistakes when the mistakes are obvious, and don't tell them ""we do not do audits"". The WHD will. If you can provide daily emails of 1 to ? minutes Missed, then why can't you provide an email of total time Made up and why don't Managers get a copy of the multiple form submissions so they can help their employee if they appear to be struggling? Is it really fair to tell an employee ""talk to your CA or administrator"" when they have no clue because they are left out of the loop? They have to work twice as hard as WFM because WFM assumes absolutely no responsibility, help, or accountability for mismanagement of time, but they sure will use the faulty system to fire you or write you up instead of doing their job. I wasn't fired... I left and the turn over is high mostly because of this and this alone. So if Whirlpool is wondering why attrition is low, point to WFM. Its time the CEO finds out about this issue, because I truly don't think he does. I would love to work there, like many others who left within 3-6 months, but the anxiety and panic attacks, are not worth it.

Fri Aug 17 2018, Senior Manager,"Benton Harbor, MI",Former Employee ,Great first or second job to build a strong career base,2,"State-of-the-art facilities throughout corporate HQ campus, committed employees, great products.

Whirlpool Corp. is a great place to start your career, gain experience, and learn about the corporate culture before establishing your career with another company that values experience. Join through the Leadership Development Program so you can cycle through three 18-month rotations and really learn the business. Expect to work 12+ hour days. The HQ community is small but beautiful, located on the shores of Lake Michigan, and close to larger cities.

The products are high quality and made locally in each region. In the US, appliances are made in 9 manufacturing plants in 5 states. 

Benefits and pay are competitive when viewed in aggregate. The sr. executive performance incentives are aggressive and rewarding.
","Short-term focus leads to no long-term strategy, competitive culture limits cross functional collaboration & innovation.

The company's pay and evaluation system is managed to one, so your work will be evaluated against your peers'. This has created a highly competitive culture where teamwork is not rewarded. Short-term department level successes are valued more highly than long-term enterprise impact because of the need to meet quarterly targets. Managers create ""wins"" by reorganizing systems and processes, then moving to new roles before the success or failure of those random changes are realized. 

The company is old school, and white extroverted men do well. Men are paid approximately 25% more than women, and they will be promoted faster and higher. Reductions and reorgs tracked from 2015-2018 included zero promotions for women above the director level. Those same reductions targeted workers over 45 at an ~85% rate and women at an ~80% rate in the US. Plan accordingly. If you are above 40, do not join Whirlpool at anything below the senior director level, and then expect to stay no longer than 5 years if you're a woman, 10 if you're a man.
Advice to Management
Focus on the long-term rather than the Wall Street-driven Q-over-Q rat race. Learn that top talent may look, think, and lead differently than you and push you outside your comfort zone. That's a net positive for you and the company. To have innovation-driving risk taking, you have to have a culture where failure is allowed vs career-ending. If you're not willing to receive truth to power, the company will fail. Most importantly, truly live and lead the Whirlpool values.

Investing in the area.
","Leadership continually reinforces the company strategy is sound and execution is the issue, essentially pushing the blame from senior leaders to the broader organization.

Promotions in large part are based on internal politics and social connections and not results.

Specifically this has historically been a product built and led organization and yet the leadership in product underperforms and remains intact. New launches miss all KPIs and have no true innovation. GPO leader and CTO are not capable.

Regional Presidents and Marketing leaders continue to under-deliver and yet there are no meaningful changes there. Mostly in the largest and most important regions (NA and Europe)

Spin off of smaller business units was a good idea but results are absent due to weak leadership which of course is not changing.

6-8 reduction in force across the organization in 2-3 years. Sr leaders are handsomely compensated and yet do not deliver. 8 straight quarters of missed internal and external expectations and a stock price that is down significantly while the market is up.

Wed Jun 13 2018, Program Manager,"Benton Harbor, MI",Current Employee ,Program Manager,0,"Whirlpool is a great place to work. Most important to me are the corporate values which stress respect, inclusion, and transparency. The ability to network and explore different roles also makes this a very good place to develop cross-functional skills. Salaries are good and the annual bonus coupled with the low cost of living make living and working here quite lucrative.

I love living in Southwest Michigan. The closeness to Lake Michigan and the beautiful beaches, accessibility and nearness to state parks and rivers makes it a great place to live if you love the outdoors. Since the region is mainly agricultural there are wonderful farmers' markets.

The twin cities of Benton Harbor & St. Joseph are near enough to larger cities of South Bend, Kalamazoo & Grand Rapids and the mega-city of Chicago that you can always get to a big city for it's cultural amenities.
","Functional management is sometimes not as transparent and communicative. 
Sometimes short-term gains are prioritized over long-term rewards.
No matter how hard we have been trying, some organizations still exhibit sub-optimal behavior and try to exist in ""silos"" instead of cross-competency collaboration.
As with all large corporations, politics can be excessive.

SW Michigan is composed of small towns and is otherwise rural/agricultural. If you don't like living in this environment then you have to commute from South Bend, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids or even Chicago's eastern suburbs.

There can be a lot of tourists in the area during May-September.

8. you only get 3 full 7 min breaks with a full 26 min lunch break while busting your butt on the job.

10. The HR People are clearly brain-dead

After I called him to remind him that I got paid the month after my last day, and informed him to initiate a case with HR/Payroll, it became a long battle with HR/Payroll. Since early November, I had called them multiple times asking for the over-payment letter. As of last December when I last spoke to someone, they were still working on it.

Management for ALL areas should really evaluate time to time what their people are doing, there is a lot of people that is known for being lazy, online shopping, separating meeting rooms just to group to chit-chat and go online, many express in a very low and unprofessional way about their co-workers and managers, they open meetings and don't even pay attention (constant texting on their cell phone), some people do the minimum work done and things just get done because somebody else is actually working and managers don't notice!, etc....

Sun Aug 13 2017, Director,"Benton Harbor, MI",Former Employee ,Disappointment,21,"Some of the greatest most skilled people I've ever met. Great diversity. Most of the management was exceptional. Great levels of investment in all the right areas. For what it is, Whirlpool is one of the best companies for which I've been associated. I have to say, having just left and seen some of the other companies out there, that Whirlpool has so much to offer and so many opportunities to succeed. They attract the best talent and if they could stop exploiting that talent and leverage it to their good and the employees good, they are unstoppable. They can crush their competition and dominate the marketplace.
","However, they are ruled by an elite group of white men who believe they are all knowing. They have driven away their best talents to other places, and put into place more white men to secretly demean women, minorities - especially black men, and anyone who could possibly encroach on their power. They are exceptionally insecure, but in a manner in which they pile their walls high with yes men, who revel in the wine clubs and local catholic school system. Their clubs and good ol' boy networks are alive and strong and even though you don't need to be a great leader or competent in business, relationships, financial acumen, or any skills which should have served them to advance shareholder value or employee satisfaction, you will not get in. Whirlpool has so many great middle manager and so many soldiers for the trenches that are amazing, that they can still move forward. It is just so disappointing. So sad how they shed the good talent, the best talent. I watched them fabricate stories to push out many great individual leaders. I too loved the company and never thought they would do it to me, but when they need a sacrifice, they find one. They always do.

Mon Jul 10 2017,Anonymous,"Benton Harbor, MI",Former Employee ,"Not perfect, but still a great career builder, good lessons learned, super people",7,"Provides fantastic training opportunities and career growth, lateral and upward. Great products thoughtfully engineered. Everyone from manufacturing to executive leadership were concerned and extremely passionate about quality and a consumer-centric mindset. Lots of intellectual tools provided to get the job done - innovative thought rewarded consistently. Great commitment to community and giving back. Continuing commitment to diversity with inclusion. Lots of voluntary mentoring going on between higher executives and promising talent. Opportunities to serve on extracurricular committees. Super people across the organization - fostered great camaraderie - made some of the best friends of my life there. Two excellent CEO's served while I was there - always felt the company was overall in great hands, and in my opinion still is.
","Saw many get promoted into people leadership positions (e.g. director and above) because they were ""super smart"" technically, yet their complete lack of interpersonal and people leadership skills was ignored. They need to define promotion-worthy talent as having a balanced combination of technical competency, people/soft skills/EQ and potential for further growth. Focusing on one element meant some people having their careers"" get ahead of them"" and then floundering; which in turn often caused their subordinates with great talent to exit the company. 

As a public NYSE company, the end of the each quarter dictated our strategy. Thousands of us work for months to set up our bottom-up, annual sell-in forecasts and product plans for the next year, then the top-down would come back and dictate a much higher and unrealistic final forecast. Then, when the numbers started to come up short, our organized activity plans and budgets would be thrown to the four winds to make our numbers and pander to the good opinion of a handful of Wall Street analysts. Lots of ""draining the swamp"" (pulling sales forward) to hastily make the quarterly earnings estimates. 

Associates are sometimes moved too quickly through their roles (when I was there, the average was 18 months) without the opportunity to truly master the skills, or to experience the added success of building and being part of a close-knit, cohesive team. 

After a promotion or a lateral move, many were required to ""hang on"" to duties of their old role for an unreasonable amount of time. When this happened, employees started their new role at a disadvantage because they couldn't focus on getting quickly up to speed in the new. 

Culture of meetings... meetings... and more meetings... in my leadership role, I was booked in so many meetings that I couldn't decline, that many days I was unable to start my ""hands on work"" until after 4 PM. Many of the meetings were ""project status check-ins"" rather than reserved only for true collaboration and decision making. This made work-life balance virtually impossible.
Advice to Management
Value EQ as highly as IQ. Value mature, experienced talent as well as the twenty-something new B-school grads. Unfortunately witnessed high-performing folks being ""aged-out"", causing huge brain-drain just to reduce salary expenses. 

If BOD and exec leadership are going to dictate the forecasts in the end anyway, then consider how much more value teams could create rather than being required to spend 2-3 months on building bottom-up numbers and going through the alignment process for the next year, just to have that input over-ridden. 

Such a wonderful company overall - give the same amazing care and respect to your talent as you give to your consumers. Apply innovation methodology to employee retention and core business issues, not just new products and services.

Fri Aug 11 2017, Sourcing Specialist,"Benton Harbor, MI",Former Employee ,Former Procurement Specialist,9,"Great location for 4 months in the summer! Corporate Facilities are new and modern with lots of windows. The pay is above average if you are in a management position and the 401k match is pretty decent. Great discounts on products. Great corporate experience to put on a resume if you can hang in there long enough, lots of early career professionals in leadership roles.
","Whirlpool is really a pretty unethical company. The community they reside in Benton Harbor, MI is in shambles, despite their work with the local United Way Foundation (which equates to an executive dog and pony show golf tournament where sponsors pay big dollars to participate) they could be putting much more money back into the community and they aren't, it's sad really. The work culture itself is very high pressure, it's expected that you be available practically 24 hours a day, without the tools to even do so. Many of the managers are international recruits which have no clue about United States employment regulations which in turn leads to harassment, discrimination, and all sorts of other unethical practices to save money which go unchecked. You will be micro managed here even to the point of not being able to go to the bathroom without being called out and asked where you were. I later ran into lots of people in the community that had been long time employees +25 years and then had been laid off from Whirlpool during one of their cycles left with no where else to really go and little chance of being able to find comparable work without having to move. 

There is no training whatsoever, it is expected that you know everything after about 30 days on the job and there and in my experience there was absolutely no flexibility in work schedule, they will want you to sit right at your desk all day long so that you are available. 

Their performance rating system forces at least someone in your group to receive a bad review regardless of their performance. It doesn't foster a good working environment, but rather pits everyone against each other.

Sat Jun 24 2017,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Ok place to work,2,"- Salary seems to be above market, which makes sense. You gotta offer something to have someone move to such a tiny town.

- Summers are nice. It's awesome you can take summer hours and go to the lake. Although, I would not take this for granted because some business units within Whirlpool don't follow summer hours.

- You will get good experience working here and if you're liked by management, they will treat you well, accommodate to your needs and give you opportunities to grow.

- Most of the people I have interacted with were friendly and willing to help. Like most other companies, some had their own personal agenda.
","- Small town. Not the best place to live unless you're looking to start a family and even then it's questionable. This makes it very hard to attract outside talent, especially young talent. 

- Their HR policies literally contradict with their values. They're all about ""one whirlpool"" and acting as a team, yet performance reviews are done using a forced distribution system where people are pitted against one another.

- Senior Leadership actions don't align with their words. They say one thing but do another.

- Be prepared to be doing the work of multiple people. Leadership is a big fan of attrition. 

- In the span of 3 years, I've had 6 bosses. That kind echoes all the cons I've listed. It's hard for Whirlpool to retain talent and it's also because org changes are made without any reason. 

- Whirlpool has some ridiculous processes that just add complexity for no reason. It makes driving change that much harder. Their project management process makes zero sense and their PMIS to support it is even worse.

Mon Jun 05 2017, Senior Manager,"Benton Harbor, MI",Former Employee ,Senior Manager,9,"- Some of the facilities are state of the art
- The company still has a good name on the market so adding it to you resume is not so bad
","- Being repetitive to what many said before, but this is really important: Leaders do not do what they say! 
- When you enter the company you are bombarded by all this information on how the company works with the highest ethical standards, its values, their focus on people development, the infamous CEO motto "" there is no right way to do the wrong thing"", etc. It is really impressive. You cannot avoid thinking you came to the right place! Keep your eyes and ears open, however, and after some time you will learn that most of those things are theoretical or just plain propaganda. Things are way different on the day to day. 
- It is a large corporation located in a tiny town. As a result of that, who you are friends with outside of work dictates your chances of succeeding in the company. Be friends with the right people and you can get away with just about anything
- Politics, which is a normal game in any company in the world, has reached surreal levels in the company. Being well connected and playing politics right replace being minimally competent or actually delivering minimum tangible results. In fact it is impressive the number of people around that don't do much other than showing up and opinionating without adding any value. To be fair the company tries to break this cycle by bringing people from different places, but they are smart individuals that learn fast ""how things work around here"" and happily join the game
- Are you a self started, highly motivated individual that wants to make a difference with your work? Shame on you! That is not what the company wants from you. What is expected is that you follow orders without questioning. In fact there are days you could as well leave your brain at home. Try to do anything different and you will upset a lot of people and end up being punished for challenging the status quo. No kidding, people can be punished for taking the right initiative, because didn't ask permission to do what he or she was hired to do in the first place.
- Words don't have the same meaning at Whirlpool as you have learned outside. ""Straight talk"", just to give example, actually means ""keep your head down and do as you are told to"". Again, keep your eyes and ears open and you will learn fast enough. Repeating to exhaustion the flavor of the month buzzwords is, however, a great way to play politics so leaders will do just that even though it does not mean anything or means just the opposite of what they practice
- The company is incredibly bureaucratic and so process driven that you spend more time dealing with the processes requirements than doing your actual work
- Reorganizations are frequent and change significantly how things are done, accountabilities, teams' composition, etc. generating a long, confusing and improductive transition period. When things are starting to work minimally well, but still with lots of room for improvement it is time to reorganize again and start all over. Reorganizations fail to address the main issue, though. Excessive bureucracy and improductive people, for example, typically remain in place. Talented people, on the other hand, frequently get frustrated and leave. Turn over in the company is high. 
- The company has a non compete agreement as a condition for employment. The agreement, introduced a few years back, was sold to employees as ""a standard practice in the industry"" to ""protect the high investment the company made in preparing its employees"" (wonder what they are talking about) and prevents you from working at any competitor for one year, if you decide to leave. It turns out none of the competitors have such ""standard practice in the industry"". This fact alone speaks volumes on how much you should trust the leaders in this company
- Having a non compete agreement puts you in the hands of your supervisor and they know it. They will strongly push you to resign in case they don't like you (regardless of the value you might be adding) knowing you will not be able to join the competition shortly. It happens frequently.

","Many corporate HR policies, under the guise of being more ""fair"" and ""caring"", are rapidly undermining morale across broad swaths of the company. You can't keep cutting staff to the bone indefinitely, while adding non-value-add tasks that ultimately are only used to gather data on people to use to thin the herd the next time around (every few years). Also, the company is extremely liberal in diversity and other things, such that, if you are not LGBT, or Indian, or whatever, you better keep your mouth shut about what you might believe, as there's no room for non-conformers.

","The corporate culture at Whirlpool is poisonous. Let me translate some of their leadership model:
Own it: Anything that goes wrong, even if it is caused by changes management required or insufficient resources is YOUR fault.
One Whirlpool: You are going to get hosed in favor of other favored people and projects, but don't you dare complain about it
Lead with speed: Regardless of the fact that we are not going to give you sufficient resources and an unrealistic time table, we expect you to work 70-80 hours a week to get it done (as long as you are salied, because we will not pay overtime)

Whirlpool is a very ""clique"" environment, it is very difficult to come in from the outside and break into the groups that came up through Whirlpool from the start.

Their leadership model is a joke if you are a manger. I went to several classes on leadership and coaching, and had to fight back the laughter. It applies below the manager level when convenient, but directors and above feel no need to follow it.

The perception is that more often than not - women find themselves required to ""prove"" themselves prior to a promotion/pay raise while men can get this based on potential prior to proving themselves. 
After you've been there for a period of time, you'll notice you'll stop hearing what you're doing well and the focus will be more on your faults or weaknesses - and how you need to be well rounded in every facet. Depending on your career ambitions, this most likely isn't the best route. The key would be to play on your strengths and minimize your weaknesses - the opposite of what they'll want you to do. Because of this, you'll find your ""own glass ceiling"" within 3 years. 
Bonuses rarely are 100%. Expect your base only. 
Work life balance is terrible if you want to be successful. Within the finance function - it was very hard to find 'working families'. Almost everyone above Manager level had only one working spouse if they had kids.
Advice to Management
Keep up the leadership programs - they're great for people to start. Gender Equality is significantly lacking in certain functions. Don't choose favorites - but stick to what you preach - performance.

","1. Unbelievable politics and hidden agendas among upper management.
2. Recent major restructure within GPO (Global Product Organization) was blatant age discrimination with very large % of those laid off in the 'over 50-highly compensated-long career employees'. Ridiculous attempt to justify the lay offs with systemic low ratings given to targeted employees over a 2 year period. Many of those 105 people laid off have compared notes and now understand the coordinated approach to this restructure and downsizing.
3. Project plans are formalized and accepted but when project is delayed for good reasons, schedule absolutely rules. Bad decisions made to move forward with production with no regard for customer perception or experience. Only goal is to sell the product. This is why competitors are beating Whirlpool. 
4. No coordinated strategic approach to product innovation and if an approach is attempted, no accountability for results.
5. Management and HR can not be trusted - beware! What you are told by either is likely in-line with hidden plans and agendas and certainly not with your best interests in mind.

- Employee rating system drives unhealthy competition between employees, causing employees to be invested in making sure only their rating at the end of the year is good.
