But old school hard nosed people who feel they have been passed over or never get that shot they are looking for (possibly while Humana was evolving over the years) can be the biggest obstacle to your success. Old Timers are often disgruntled huge obstacles here and seem to go unchecked. This opinion is not being stated based on just one experience. It is a bit of a potluck you never know what your going to get stuck with cause a little bit of everything is in there and sometimes you can get dealt a bad hand.

Former Employee - Senior Actuarial Analyst 
Neutral Outlook
Approves of CEO
I worked at Humana full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
I worked for Humana for over 3 years, initially starting as an actuarial intern then progressing through the titles via the Actuarial Development Program. During that time I would say the main selling points were as follows: the culture, work life balance, the Actuarial Study Program, and Rotational Program. The actuarial leadership team makes a very hard attempt to not only expose you to a variety of areas, but also ensure that you have the opportunity to properly network amongst your peers at a variety of different leadership levels. Compared to the study programs I have seen, theirs is very rich and has incredibly fair guidelines. I am very thankful that I came across this company very early on in my career - for it kicked off my career as an actuary.
Cons
Rotational Program - yes this is a PRO as well as a CON. First of all participation in the program is required (aka non-optional), so if you are in a role that you love and you are selected by leadership to rotate, you have to do so. Secondly, while the purpose of the rotational program is to expose you to a variety of areas, that doesn't always seem to be what happens. Not only is the program extremely political amongst leadership - but some departments will keep strong talent to themselves and rotate that talent internally as opposed to opening up those positions to everyone in the company. And you have very little say about where you end up. So your best bet is to network yourself like crazy with leadership and the rotational committee to ensure you are given a decent posting. 

Non-Competitive Salaries - This is a very common problem in many insurance companies. Unless you are a ""favorite"" it does not pay to be loyal and become a ""lifer."" I have seen employees leave for a much higher salary, do a year at a competitor where they passed no exams, then return to Humana at that heightened salary. Personally I'd rather they simply offer more competitive salaries than make their talent quit and return to attain competitive pay. 

Lack of Ability to Permanently Work From Home (Pre COVID 19)- While some departments are flexible in allowing team members to work from home after an initial trial period of working in the office, not all are open to this arrangement - which in turn limits not only the opportunities available to you, but it also makes it easier to depart the company once your accreditations are complete. In this day and age, it is very easy to find a company that will support you as fully remote associate so if anything this restriction is hurting the company more than helping it.

Inability to Get Promoted Without ASA Credentials - Again this is something I have seen in several insurance companies however over the past decade or so it has been a policy that has evolved in other companies but not yet Humana. The truth of the matter is if you do not attain your ASA, then regardless of the quality of your work you cannot be promoted or be compensated accordingly. It is an unfortunate rule that has been enforced for years that shows no indication of changing. Your skillset is still highly valued, but until those accreditations are attained at a minimum, you will not payed or promoted accordingly.
Advice to Management
While the Actuarial Development Program is great in terms of study support, certain components such as compensation, ability to work from home, and opportunities for actuaries who struggle with exams to enter an non-traditional role need to be reconsidered.

","Humana is a very hard environment. I worked there full time for nearly 16 years before being laid off despite yearly reviews stating my job performance was full or exceptional. The company itself is poorly run, but your job satisfaction depends a lot on your immediate Supervisor or Manager. Over the years, I worked for several exceptional leaders and many who were lazy or just unqualified, but were in their role because they were personal friends with upper management. The company regularly tells you how lucky you are to work there while providing subpar employee health insurance, infrequent raises despite job performance, constant management changes, and constant changes to directives and initiatives. They think nothing of laying off long term employees of 10, 15, 20+ years if they can outsource your job or hire someone off the street with no experience for less money. In my experience, the company seems to care very little about the employees.

Mon Sep 21 2020, Inside Sales Agent,"Phoenix, AZ",Former Employee ,Only if you handle stress well and want to sell health insurance,0,"Mostly friendly coworkers, potential for good pay with base+unlimited comm, gift cards for achievers, lots of training and educational resources, covers cost for state licensing, paid VTO/PTO, and a gift card rewards program for maintaining your health/financial life outside of work.
","Bad management with inconsistencies in training materials and job aids that are outdated, not consolidated, long winded, and sometimes difficult to find while interacting with customers. There is also pressure to work unrealistic amounts of over time for up to 3 months at a time even with 6 call centers and 150+ employees at each. Hard to get PTO approved even in the off season with unscheduled black outs and training. Then there's the skilling system that throws new hires under the bus before they can thrive and keeps them there unless you can successfully convert cold calls and leads. Its a constant struggle to find balance between meeting sales quotas while genuinely caring for the needs and well being of your customers. There is a lot of favoritism and unless you can meet and continue to exceed sales goals regardless of the bucket you've found yourself in management pretty much writes you off as someone who well be leaving soon if you're not the type of employee to be terminated for cause.
Advice to Management
Upper management should consider middle management and floor supervisors more carefully or since it is a public traded company perhaps even upper management should be re-evaluated. Within the last few months of my employment there a floor supervisor resigned/was fired, both our associate directors resigned from what I've heard a conflict of interest, the quality assurance manager was terminated for an undisclosed reason, and an employee took his life on-site.

Nice buildings to work in and they have a great gym with qualified staff. Cafeterias are nice but expensive. They prefer to hire from within so you have plenty of opportunities to move around.
","VERY trigger happy when it comes to letting people go. I watched half of my team be decimated in 6 months. Saw other teams be wiped out completely. High turnover rates and no job security. They claim they encourage employees to ""speak up"" if you see any problems, but you will be penalized if you do so without offering an immediate solution. Very petty with office politics.

Wed Jun 10 2020, Administrative Coordinator,"Jacksonville, FL",Former Employee ,"Good opportunity, but improvements to be made",2,"Good opportunity overall. Decent pay. Work at Home. Benefits - Insurance, 401k 6% match, decent PTO (23 days a year), Volunteer time off (8 hours/yr), my immediate supervisor really cared for employees, team members in my experience were wonderful, CEO/upper management- I can tell they do care about the company
","Department restructures are common. There is no room for advancement in my specific position. Workload is pretty heavy most of the time and can be quite stressful lots of the time - it’s common to be doing the work of more than one person and when coworkers are out on PTO, there is even more additional work. In my experience, you work much harder and there is much more of an expectation in an at home job such as this one, then in an office setting. There had been a significant growth in my department over the years but did not hired any additional staff to accommodate. They do monitor your productivity via DPA software, it shows any idle time and which activities you are spending your time. If you do your job, this is no big deal. But there is a slight micromanage. They really are proud of the Humana values and they do a decent job of reflecting most of them in my opinion. But there are some that I believe, and my team/department would agree, there is a disconnect on. An example- There is a 30 min wellness break each week that Humana promotes to its employees. However in the several years I was there- no one has been able to take advantage of it in my team/department. It had been “in the works” by immediate management for years. Large disconnect in upper management’s understanding on what we do on the day to day. “Pioneering simplicity” is supported and advocated by immediate supervisors but then gets combatted by upper management. Which in my observations leads to some frequent frustrations with members and facilities. This is a very defeating feeing for my department/team to frequently be advocates for change, simplicity and best practices, only to be redirected by upper management who are not familiar with what you do on a day to day. My job role turned out to be completely different than the posted job I applied, interviewed and believed I was being hired to do.

","Time off only during off peak season which can last 3-5 months. Terrible ""error"" merit system (you make a mistake and it stays on file 6 months-this should be shorter). The health insurance is the worst I've ever had in my life. I pay only a single digit percent toward 401k, next deduction is my health insurance, family, only high deductible plans available, after deductions, last year I averaged only SIXTY PERCENT of my take-home pay. An average of 40 percent went to taxes, insurance and my tiny 401k contribution. To top it off, I STILL had thousands of dollars in medical bills to pay. Company contributes SOME toward the HSA HOWEVER you have to jump though ENDLESS hoops using a ridiculous, non-functional and completely not IT supported app to track your physical activity and biometrics and there's A LOT they simply won't give you credit for. If the app messes up and doesn't credit you points for activities, they just shrug and say welp, sorry. You never can recover the lost points. Back to the job, the call center aspect is probably a slightly better atmosphere than many call centers and my department has few restrictions on call metrics so that helps with the stress level.

You get to pick your own schedule after the standard 9-5 training is completed. They’ll cover the cost of your licensing, if you aren’t already licensed, during training. Amazing benefits that start from day 1. Pay and benefits are all that I miss from this company.
","Dress code — why is there a “business”-level dress code? No customers are allowed in the building, no one sees you. Management clearly played favorites with this rule.

Training — training was all over the place. No consistent trainers. One manager trains you for a few days, then another, another, another, etc. The training classes themselves are reminiscent of a high school classroom. The people they then pair you with after training is over are usually quite awful. For the most part, they’re unwilling to help you, other than berating you for not doing the job as well as them, or they’re bitter that they were asked to help someone and now they themselves are losing sales, so they’re not exactly helpful.

Management — while there were a couple of truly, honestly great managers that I enjoyed working with and being around...most were just awful people. You can tell they were miserable and stretched thin, but it’s not an excuse to berate others or literally yell and insult people. Never a good way to set an example. 

Technology — computer systems consistently down and not working. Can’t make money if phones and/or computers aren’t working. Still expected to somehow make the company money, though.

Overall, the mental stress isn’t worth the pay.
Advice to Management
When managers are miserable, it makes everyone else miserable. Learn some people skills and maybe talk to yourselves the way you talk to your sales agents, so you can see what it’s like to constantly be talked to like a child.

They need better leadership skills on this team, from building a more positive collaborative environment and the leaders need to not be micromanagers. 
They think that they are building a team that accepts ""accountability"" but rather it's just an excuse to yell at the associates for the mistakes rather than working more closely alongside them to help them grow. You create a very negative culture from that bc the associates are really close to one another so they talk. 
They're super traditional so you report in at 9AM (no later than that) and you follow the rules (including business casual dress code). 
They also don't recognize that this is an area that they're severely lacking in so they refuse to focus on this to improve it.

","Humana hires lots of nurses and when the market turns down, it fires a lot of nurses. This cycle repeats AT LEAST once a year. The criteria for the continual reductions in force are completely opaque and seemingly arbitrary. Management uses double-speak to placate the folks who were spared the mass lay-offs and don't include the feedback of direct-facing nurses in any meaningful way to try to meet the needs of the customer and the $$-hungry board. While Humana makes a big show about how much it supposedly cares about its employees, it's a company that regards its employees as highly expendable resources. This is literally a job that will have you constantly worrying about when you will be laid off...because eventually...you will.

","There is no benefit to working hard. Promotions are not based on performance. Mass hiring and mass layoffs are a yearly occurrence. Organizational structure is in constant flux resulting in a workforce who barely knows who they report to. 

Fired on 7 year anniversary. This happened literally 30 minutes after a department meeting where it as announced that 40 new associates in Puerto Rico will be hired on. Termination reasons were true at surface level, but dont tell the full story. 

Fired for: 
-Not responding to an email within 24 hours. Which email? one of the 15 sent daily of which it is unclear whether or not a response is required?

-Missed production this month. First time in 7 years missing production. Production was only missed because I was working right from a work list provided by management. In fact, this was the first month I said to heck with my own way or doing things and worked strictly from the list they provided. 

-Idle time too high. I do agree idle time is high, but no matter how consistently work is getting done idle time is always over their expectation. The idle time counter is ill understood by management and is micromanagement at its finest. How can idle time be 3 hours a day, yet production goals are far exceeded? Hours worked are more important than work done. 

-Case out of compliance. An aged case was found nearing the compliance deadline. Email was sent to management about said case. Management said they would take care of it. This was all documented via email. Case was not taken care of by management. The case eventually aged out of compliance and resulted in a write up. 

After 7 years of service and never missing a performance bonus or a day of work, there was no acknowledgement of the good. Only mention of the final month where new systems are creating chaos within the department and mistakes were being made.
Advice to Management
-Cut it with the reports and the reports of reports. Cut it with the EXTREME micromanagement. If the work is getting done and is satisfactory, then do not hound associates with emails and report requests. 
-Drop it with the idle time metric. Its a joke. If you hire the right workers and train them appropriately, then the only metrics that should matter are production and quality. 
-Do not create opportunities to write associates up just so you can fire them without a compensation package. 
-Do not release new software that is not ready for service and expect associates to maintain performance. 
-Your workforce is going to diminish in quality and reliability as you continue to micromanage, squeeze pennies and drive your top associates to work for the other team.

Caps and limits were placed on participation in career development unless directly related to current role. Learning new tools not related to direct role and moving into other departments was pretty much non-existent by the time lay-offs occurred in the wellness segment. 

As above, 80% of our section were laid off. Layoffs seemed to happen more frequently within the last 3 years. 

Overall organization does not prioritize preventive health of it's members or employees despite marketing ""rewards"" for healthy improvements. Wellness programs and wellness employees are frequently offered to members as a catch-all in place of actual medical coverage.
Advice to Management
Remove restriction to participate in career development outside of direct role. It's not really possible to move into another area due to needing experience in those tools, yet you can't get the experience with those tools if you aren't working in that area already. Huge Catch-22. 

Invest in actual preventive care, not just the marketing of it. Most members are sent to the wellness programs with referral heavy priority, but who have no actual coverage for the medical help they actually needed (or medication). 

Support employees with proper benefit coverage and salary, prevent burned-out associates with a realistic work-life balance. Employees participating in wellness programs were often joining due to being over-worked with required overtime, over-stressed, and underpaid with little to no support.

","Sometimes feeling frustrated with so many frequent changes in work flow or switching departments/managers/work group.
Sometimes difficult to see that we are unable to offer real help to some clients and feeling helpless...ie a client with one below knee amputation tried to obtain a motorized wheelchair was denied because doctor did not document the need well or even state the leg amputation in the request to have it approved by Humana. When I got this client who had given up trying to appeal the denial, after several talks I convinced the client to go to another doctor appointment to be re-evaluated then try to appeal whole process and I would help on my end. Client did this, I tried coordinating on my end with appeals department and reaching out to the medical equipment company too. It took lots of time+coordination with multiple people. I definitely noticed that many times it was as if the ""right hand didnt know what left hand was doing"" so it was an overall frustrating time for me as the employee and surely for the clients when things did not go how they should. This is probably not the case for every department especially since not every client has this experience or needs this much help but when someone really needs the help it is sad to see that things do not go as it appears it should go. That is life I guess....so hey proceed with caution and just do your very best with the hand you are dealt!

","Humana isn’t a meritocracy. It’s a political place, filled with minefields you have to navigate successfully to get decent raises, good assignments and promotions. People have long memories. P*^% someone important off, and your career will stagnate. Also, your experience will vary depending on where within the organization you work—and with whom. If you get a great manager, you’ll likely have a great experience. Get a poor manager, and your work life will reflect that. You may also end up working insane hours with little financial reward if you’re an exempt employee. Money tends to collect at the top of the hierarchy. Everyone else gets the leftovers, and they’re sparse.
Advice to Management
Give your everyday associates a real stake in Humana. Allow us to either buy shares of common stock at a deep discount or do what you do for management—give people shares that vest within three years. Do that in addition to giving bonuses. Let us share in the company’s profitability. Reward people based on what they do, not how they look or who they know. Figure out how to get more ethnic diversity at the director and higher levels.

The pay is not bad for a sales position (hourly base + commission) especially when looking at working within the insurance industry which tends to be commission only. Overall the environment was relatively laid back, and the managers weren't psycho tyrants as one may find at other sales driven businesses. I was happy during my time there and incredibly thankful that they gave me an opportunity, particularly when the job market was doing poorly and still recovering from the recession.
","As a telesales agent, the downside is the type of work you'll be doing during ROY (Rest of the year) outside of the busy Annual Enrollment Period. During this time you'll likely be cold-calling trying to sell Supplemental Medicare plans (which at the time I worked there, wasn't ver competitive). The plus side is everybody sucked at this so the standards were not terribly high as far as converting cold calls into anything. It was essentially to keep you busy up to the next enrollment period. However, If you do well during the enrollment period or work certain hours you may be put on inbound during ROY and not be doomed to cold-calling. Overall, the cold calling wasn't that bad, again, because expectations weren't terribly high (at least when I was working there)

Told this was a foundation then will build on with mentor. 2 days with mentor, which included listening to 2 calls, told to click here, click there ,No your doing it wrong. NOPE,NOPE is a word I learned well. Day 3 with mentor calls being critqued by QA REALLY. First two call I made still learning and in orientation. Talk about a kick in the face. Lots of pressure to perform with little training. Figure it out. Hours and Hours of OT each day. Documentation is a nightmare. Nursing Care Plans handwritting out, like nursing school on EVERY diagnosis person has had over past year whether its an issue or not. Called areas of focus, can end up with 10-15 to have to manually type out a long care plan on each even if not an issue!!! Mandatory Overtime. AS SOON AS I FIND ANOTHER JOB I AM GONE!!!!!! On a good note the first trainer was so sweet, too bad they don't follow her lead by being real and supportive. My Coach (manager) was very nice, tried to encourage me.

Advice to Management
My advice to anyone wanting to work at Humana: It could be worth your time if you are desperate to get out of whatever you are currently doing, but don’t stick around too long. Learn what you need to and then MOVE ON. 

Here’s why:

I know deep in my heart that a business like the one Humana is currently running (2019) won’t last. It’s very outdated. I just couldn’t ever in my lifetime NOT give raises to people for an entire year or two when I’m cashing in millions upon millions of dollars of stocks for myself. I just couldn’t do it like the current CEO (Bruce Broussard) and the tons of others that do it. My heart and brain thinks different. While I always got raises and was never laid off, my heart broke for those it happened to year after year after year. I was always told by leadership “well, that’s just how business is” and that is INCORRECT. Thankfully, after reading about very successful companies like Costco who give employees raises no matter what, I understand there are some big businesses in the world that think like me. You CAN figure out ways to give raises every year. YES YOU CAN. 

I left Humana being thankful for some marketing tricks I learned as well as how NOT to run a business and how NOT to treat people as a future leader myself. All three skills were worth my short time there.

I left Humana being thankful for some marketing tricks I learned as well as how NOT to run a business and how NOT to treat people as a future leader myself. All three skills were worth my short time there.

I worked at Humana full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Humana invests in their employees. They really value and encourage health and wellness, along with work/life balance.
Cons
The company was laying off at the time I left, which caused insecurity. There were too many changes all at once- salaried employees changed to hourly, reduced mileage reimbursement, increased required territory coverage. I lost my manager and most of my team, and I was then transferred to another state's manager/team.

","You are forced to work mandatory overtime. Sometimes 5 days a week 2hrs mandatory per day Mon-Fri plus an additional 8hrs on Saturday. A total of 18 mandatory hrs per week overtime. You are told what time you have to come in on Saturdays, no exceptions. Overtime is usually short notice and you are penalized if you can’t work the OT. Management is horrible. You’re treated like you can easily be replaced. Rachel and Deon are the best Frontline leaders in call center. There is no room for growth. If you voice your concerns you suffer retaliation by management(FLL).You can only go to the restroom on your scheduled breaks. It’s almost impossible to get your quarterly bonus. Raises are low and at your FLL’s discretion. Advancement to other departments is at your FLL’s discretion. Some associates don’t get opportunities because of FLL retaliation. It’s a lot of work with no respect. The scoring for REACH was created to hinder you from getting your quarterly bonus. Depending on your FLL you might not get your points based on FLL retaliation. Some of the FLL’s are on a power trip. Some of the TL’s would make better FLL’s. It’s Hard to request time. You get occurrences even if you’re in the ER with a doctor’s note or have to go to court. You have to request off 2 weeks in advance, and it has to be approved no excuse. And it’s is still impossible to get days off. You’re expected to come to work sick with the flu. High turnover rate.

Thu Aug 23 2018, Customer Service Representative,"Louisville, KY",Current Employee ,WORK AT HOME,6,"The pro to working for Humana is that the minimum wage for their company, at least in my state is $15/hr. The raises have been cut considerably but they're still better than a lot of other companies in my area. (Louisville, KY)
The real pro is working from home. It's almost worth the cons, would be great for people who like to work alone or not have to drive.
","Poor leadership. There seems to be too many people that are in charge but no one knows who to reach out to if theres an issue they cant assist with. Theres a lot of communication problems between leadership.

The break system is pretty bad. I've had my 1st break and lunch only 20 minutes apart. 

While WAH is amazing there are of course issues that follow. Namely, the group chats are not always helpful. It's sometimes difficult to get answers you need that you cant find yourself and once someone does finally reply they usually ask you multiple times if you've tried other means to find the answer. Which makes for long hold times and upset clients. 

The biggest complaint, I think for me, is the disregard for the workers time. Planning ahead for vacations or out of town trips is a nightmare. They wont approve your time in advance. I've been told there is no way to send time sensitive requests higher up, no one to email. If you plan a vacation months ahead and notify them several months in advance they wont give you info until the first of the month you have your vacation, if not up to the week of. For a company with this many employees youd think there would be a policy in place to ensure that employees are rewarded for being diligent but that's not the case. Leadership acts as though there is an entity far beyond their reach that you should just hope and pray to that they approve your request so you dont get told the vacation is not approved and lose out on nonrefundable suites, airfair, tickets, etc. 

Other cons include their systems, it seems like there is a lot of unfinished ideas to improve call rep handle times and this has lead to different information being located in 8 systems and you're told constantly to stop using that, use this and then a week later stop that, do this. Makes it difficult to be efficient. 

Chance for growth is pretty bleak.

","Management is completely disconnected from associates. 
I worked a few times where I didn't get breaks and/or lunches. Which is illegal. 
Absolutely no consideration for associates work/life balance. I worked part time and would NEVER consider working full-time as there is mandatory overtime almost every week which extends to Saturday sometimes. 
Benefits are almost laughable, they should be embarrassed considering they are an insurance company. 
After I resigned, I never heard from my boss again. No exit interview, no wrap up, didn't even get escorted out to drop my badge off. 
Watch your check carefully, I was shorted almost $100.00 from my last check with no explanation and no way to access anything online.
