Fri Jun 21 2013, Program Manager,"Mountain View, CA",Former Employee ,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable",2968,"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).
","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(
Advice to Management
1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management. 

2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done; what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed? 

3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment.

Sat May 10 2014, Software Engineer III,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects",1032,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.
","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.

-) The growth (you willl get invaluable development feedback from 360 degree reviews, that, if you are able to internalize and incorporate the feedback, will propel your career forward)
-) Variety. So many groups in one place, that when you're ready for your next career exploration, it will be easy and smooth. Google wants to be the last place you'll ever work.
-) Scale. If you want to have lots of users, in some cases billions, Google is a lot of fun and you are helping many people who use your product directly or indirectly. 
-) Free food and stocked ""micro-kitchens"" with snacks. And, the shuttles (okay, in 2020-21 this isn't a factor, but it will be when we all go back.)
Help the environment and make friends with neighbors, while riding a climate controlled bus with leather seats and friendly bus drivers, to work & back. If you can read in cars, you also will probably be able to get all your email done on the way to and from work, and the day is just about getting real work done.
","It is a large company, with over 100,000 employees, so there are often many people involved in any given project. You will need to be patient to work with stakeholders. Most teams have minimal politics so this goes smoothly. Things take longer than in a startup, but on the other hand, the scale of users, products, infrastructure is much greater.

You don’t have to know Google Ads to start the role and they train you in the product very well. By a year in the role you’ll be in the 95% percentile of Google ads experts and you’ll have the opportunity to explore other roles at Google if you please. If you do well your pay goes through yearly refreshes and It can make a huge difference. You get to bring your whole self to work and that’s really cool.
","If you are joining the role from another company It is very vague if you will come into the role as an L2 (hourly) or L3 and that can make a big difference in compensation. People with 2-3 years of experience can make the same as a college grad and that can be frustrating. While pay has the potential to go up if you perform well, promotions can feel slow due to only 2 cycles a year which can limit you from going to roles that require certain levels. You will be challenged and need to have discipline, but it’s not a cutthroat environment in the slightest everyone helps everyone.

In non-covid times the offices are well equipped, all the snacks, food, gyms, massage rooms, nap pods. It's the stuff of much satire. It's very nice.

The compensation is really good. Collaboration across teams can be great, although it does depend on product area. The culture in the company and much of the scandal that comes out is born out of transparency and freedom. Freedom to express yourself many employers stomp down on and sometimes.... it's too much but usually it's quite freeing.
","The promotion process at google is well intentioned but poor, IMO. It is honestly probably the single biggest reason google is known for abandoning products. We develop things for promotions because that's what gets them. Maintaining and improving or spending the energy to rebuild and transfer data doesnt get you a promotion.

You need to land something, but you also need to excel for over a year this dissuades people pushing to do something to try and get a promotion which is good but also disincentivizing. The whole thing is political, you need to land grab at times to get work other teams might be doing so they can't do it.... again so you can get promoted. If you land in the right place at the right time it is easy to move up, rising tides raise all ships. A bad manager, a bad product idea, can sink you even if you are doing good work.

","There does not seem to be a lot of true transparency. There are always emails from senior leads explaining things but comes off very politically advised. Internally mobility does not seem like what it use to be. It has been very difficult for people to advance their careers. Work life balance, especially during the pandemic has not been great.
Advice to Management
I would advise, holding employees accountable who are not meeting the expectations or standards. Many dependable employees are burning out because they have had to pick up the work of others not performing. I believe it is finding a balance of addressing performance and mental health.

Alumni from other parts of Alphabet come speak all the time, so internal transfers are pretty transparent. It's Google, so benefits are top of the top. Free gourmet food that changes every day (with some popular staples), free dessert, free barista-made coffee, free snacks. And that's just the food, not to mention free gym, free rock climbing walls, free Ayco (Goldman Sachs) financial advice, free massages, etc. Plus, the people are super quirky, getting to know any one of them is so fascinating. There's always something that sticks out, like ""oh! that's their special quirk"". I remember my first day meeting people that came to Google from producing Emmy award-winning shows, are related to people that founded a literal sport, or have been to all continents. Google is full of incredibly smart people with interesting stories to tell.
","There are a crazy amount of benefits that its hard to keep track of. The main ones are listed and obvious but some more niche ones, or office-specific perks (like the free Lime scooters for some locations) are harder to find unless you spot the email. Maybe its more of a west coast office thing, but people are very easy going. I kind of wish it were a bit more competitive and people would flex more. I'm proud of the work people are doing but they gotta speak up!

One-sided conversations, mixed messages and wordy documents are problems.

The frequency and depth of the review process may vary by company based on company size and goals of the evaluations.

This quarterly performance review example has sections for both achievements and areas of improvement. It also has a section for core values, as this must be a key performance indicator at this company. Different companies will have different measuring sticks for success.


To conduct an effective performance review, it’s important to deliver a positive and solution-focused message. This will be less discouraging to the employee.

This performance review example shows how you can offer constructive feedback, while also praising the employee’s efforts. The majority of the sections focus on the employees’ achievements and strengths.

 

It should come at no surprise that our leadership team spends a considerable amount of tim each quarter conducting performance review.

Make it clear at the beginning of a new hire’s employment how and when employees will be evaluated. This should be part of your onboarding process and is especially important if you’re managing a remote team.
Allow employees to prepare for their review by completing a self-assessment prior to their appraisal, then allow the employee to walk their manager through the reasoning behind their self-assessment.
Deliver a positive and solution-focused message (whenever possible), this will result in a less discouraging message.

impossible to get promoted now that there are so many people and the requirements at job levels are arbitrary
Googlers who've been there forever and been promoted have clearly been promoted past their level of competence
Arbitrary leveling during hiring usually brings people in at the wrong level
Advice to Management
the google culture is not helping you, it's hurting and should change to be team focused, not individual performer
nobody does anything to help the team or the customer, just themselves during promotion. 
Promo cycles are a huge wasted effort. You need to make it way more efficient.
