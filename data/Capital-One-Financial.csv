","From the shared tech side of house- If you want a tech heavy, forward leaning programming job this ain't it chief. This is an ""argue with the tech lead about why unit tests are important"" type of job. If you try to improve the quality of programming, the populist hordes will scorn you. Adding tests and implementing design patterns takes too long, silly! You Build It You Own It culture translates internally to software developers that ship things without giving it any testing other than a quick, manual happy path. I never saw a solution get off the ground here. I consistently saw products being created that didn't meet the needs of our users, but did meet the political needs of certain managers. Inevitably, one crew of management would be fired or reorganized and another team would shepherd the product to its next phase. Be prepared to come in one day and have all your work cancelled or reorged away from you.
Advice to Management
You need high quality tech people making the tech decisions and leading the feature teams. All too often the ""tech leads"" are just tenured employees that are in line for a promotion. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the code they were producing was well done and battle tested, but floundering and metric massaging is more common. What I've seen inside disheartens me as a tech employee, and horrifies me as a capital one customer.

","The job itself is MENTALLY EXHAUSTING. Having to try to collect money from people struggling especially during a pandemic is heartbreaking. I get tired of telling people that we can’t do much for them. Capital one made very minimal effort to assist in this pandemic even though I’m sure they benefitted from corporate bailouts. The only help they provided was not charging late fees IF a person calls every month to tell them they’ve been affected by COVID. If they don’t mention COVID they get no help. And if they forget to call one month we’ll charge them late fees and can’t waive them. Also we keep charging interest every month so someone who owes 300 dollars ends up deferring because of the pandemic and losing their jobs and by the time they get a new job they owe 500 dollars. And I’ve seen it on large scales too where people go THOUSANDS of dollars over their credit limit from interest alone. And they will NOT give any offers to lower ANYONES interest rate. No matter what. So it’s very hard to work for a company that treats its employees great and their customers terribly. If you have a conscience you wouldn’t be able to take this job for long

Culture tries to be employee-centered and practice good ethics. Compensation is good but not great.
","San Francisco location is really noisy: high ceilings and wide open spaces make it an echo chamber. There are small rooms along the edge where employees may sequester themselves, but those rooms are always full. Decentralized management and week Scrum Masters means results in lots of bullying in the scrum. The company decided all software developers are engineers, so QA engineers are expected to become full-stack developers. But there is no plan or support that allows the transition, other then spending 20 hours/week outside of work to attend community college or take courses through Lynda.com . Traditional developers are balking at doing real QA, so quality suffers. Women are encouraged to participate in numerous conferences and conventions for women in tech, while the men stay at the office an work. As a result, the guys gain more experience and deliver more output in the same period. In the bigger picture, more new hires that are men are moving on to higher paying jobs. the company emphasis on diversity is at the expense of productivity. High achievers are not rewarded in the first few years out of college. ""Diverse"" groups with little background in software development recieve a small amount of training and made into Scrum Masters, and many look like deer in the headlights.

My favorite way to explain this is when I tried to find someone to invite to a work function when my partner couldn't make it with me. As I was listing people off in my head, every single one of them was a co-worker that would already be there. I did end up bringing a co-worker that might otherwise not have come, but still...it was another co-worker. 

After over 10 years, 3 departments, and countless positions, I'm still friends with many of my former co-workers. I enjoyed going to work to see my friends and work with them.

I had one boss that fought tooth and nail to get me a worthy raise due to my hard work and the fact that I was grossly underpaid for what I did and my ""title"" within the company (and I really don't care about titles).

Depending on your location - great snacks and paid or subsidized gym membership. They really do care about employee health.
","Stack-ranking for promotions and raises. The higher everyone is ranked, the worse off everyone is because ""Very Strong"" becomes the new norm and lowers everyone to ""Strong."" 
Gaining licenses and certs rarely counts for anything other than prestige and additional responsibility and opportunity, but definitely not guaranteed promotions or raises.
Long-term employment means no salary adjustment. The only way to get paid what you are worth is to leave and come back (and yes, I know people who did this and made a lot more money, mainly on the tech side of things).

There is a huge variation in performance review and promotion process across teams. Team's mentality largely depends on the management, but it's rare to find a good manager.

There is no clear definition on the ownership and rewarding process.

C1 DS is well sought after, at least in the financial industry. There appears to be a relatively high turnover rate in talents and good managers. 
For a large team of 60-70 people, the annual turnover rate can be 30-50%. Little knowledge or experience can be passed on to the junior people. For problems like this, a responsible manager would seek for employees' feedback and honest opinions. Instead, they filled many management team with Indian managers who have no other choices but to stick around due to VISA reasons. Guess what, those managers don't have employees' welfare in their interest and don't have deep understanding in tech problems. It just makes the situation worse.
Advice to Management
Make the performance review and rewarding process more transparent. Give employees a proper channel to provide feedback and voice their needs. Having managers yell at their employees about anonymous survey results is definitely not a good one.

","The management structure is very dated. Essentially all engineering teams are run by a Product Owner. The product owners sit in meetings and groom backlogs; they're not capable of contributing to meaningfully to technical discussions. Some have a technical background, but within a few months they're completely out of date on any given stack, and are functionally unable to manage an engineering team. At that point there's a real problem- software decision-making is entirely driven by a non-technical staff. This of course is a perverse incentive- instead of an engineer driving technical decisions, designing software and innovating, the engineers have to effectively beg product owners for tasking, (""please let me solve this issue the right way""). Any incentive an engineer had to excel in their trade will quickly be exhausted by this poor organizational structure.

My position is a M-F position and all major holidays off and there are time where overtime is available.
","The wrong people in the right position! Capital One or at least the site that i'm in has a trend of hiring people in management that have no previous experience in fraud or does not have the aptitude for fraud. This is an issue if you yourself have fraud experience or are a seasoned veteran, management does not like to be corrected or challenged, if they say 2+2=8 and you don't go with that then you're going to have a hard time. It's all about PERCEPTION with these people, once you go against the grain they will retaliate against you no matter how good of a performer you are and the HR or associate relations route will not help you and they will side with management automatically. My current manager is a complete ding bat and does not like to be corrected and has no experience nor the aptitude for the work, trying to have a conversation or explain things to a person like this is like trying to ice skate uphill on a sunny day. The rating system for promotions and raises are trash and it may not reflect the work you've actually done.
Advice to Management
Get some people that have experience and the aptitude for the work that is done in TMO card fraud operations, stop with the ""It's all about perception"" crap.....no it's not. Stop with the workplace retaliation just because someone calls you out on your crap and stop playing favorites with people and then pawning them off as being so good at their job just because they don't question anything.

it's more cost effective and builds loyalty when you promote internally. focus on your younger employees and their development and base employment and growth strategy on the HR data you have. attrition rate is high! this is partially because people become frustrated and go elsewhere and partially because historically associates can leave, and then come back a year or two later and skip 3 levels. associates should not be waiting 5 years for promotions when they can go elsewhere, particularly in New York market.

You won't because this is a legacy bank with a legacy management and performance structure. In other words, only white American males get into management or praised for their accomplishments, and the few minorities or people of color that do get into management have to toe the line in praising and promoting white American males. How can you have a global multiracial presence with a company that only represents white males?

• Benefits are great
• Relaxed Dress Code on Campus Office
• Work From Home opportunities (Pre-COVID). 
• Tuition Reimbursement without having to stay at the company for a certain period of time.
• 401-K match is up to 5%
• PTO and company holidays are extravagant 
• Company mimics everything Google is doing, so they’re trying to get there. Not quite the Google environment. Maybe one day if they keep following.
","• Terrible Diversity and Inclusion
• The little diversity the company has is at the bottom of the hierarchy: Document pusher, call center, production-based jobs, customer service, security, etc. 
• Terrible all performance review 
• Promotion s are based on politics
• Lack of educated and skilled managers and supervisors 
• Strong, strong office politics
• Anyone can learn the job, the job posting qualifications asks for things that management don’t have - degrees and certifications
• Title seekers: Associate, Sr. Associate, Principal Associate - Title don’t matter, salary does. A promotion from one position to the next is approximately 5-10% raise, which isn’t a lot at all. That pay range for an associate starts at 53K and Sr associate starts at 60K - 10% is not a lot over the course of a year.
Advice to Management
Learn how to follow before becoming a leader. The title manager doesn’t make one a manager. The management team should know how to do the job that they are managing. In addition, management needs to humble themselves. This isn’t your company. You are a W2 worker; not a 1099. Let that sink in.

","Tech TA isn't treated well at all. Many broken systems and bad management. Everything revolves around an old school brown nose, popularity contest type of culture. A lot of create your own value by making up pointless meetings and ""omg that's amazing"" type of responses to managements every word. Metrics are ""rank and yank"" bell-curve style not based on actual numbers. Scheduling is bad, and you will become a sourcer not a true inhouse recruiter here.
Advice to Management
The new agency style is bad. Stop awarding kiss up's and grow on peoples talents by putting them in a position to succeed, not just giving the loudest voice in the room a chance. Remove the glass ceiling you have on promotion based on popularity. If this was not COVID I believe a lot of people would leave.

Mon Sep 28 2020, Business Analysis,,Former Employee ,W/L balance dropped post-COVID,7,"I worked at Capital One for a number of years and loved my experience while I was there. If you worked hard and was motivated you could get promoted (or at least get a 5+% salary adjustment in non-promotion years). Bonuses were generous compared to other companies in the region. I went to the gym every day, took advantage of personal training and free career coaching, would often frequent the #freefood slack channel rooms to score free lunches, etc. It was a great experience aside from the standard petty office politics.
","The culture has gone down the drain post-COVID, especially with regards to work life balance, based on what my partner (still at Capital One) says. I asked my partner to take one day off of work to come with me to close on a house and he refused because taking a non-Friday off would be a red flag in his group. I then asked if he could take the Friday off to help move and he said that might also be a red flag. He also made it clear that based on the way his team functions, he's not planning to take more than 1 week of paternity leave next year because he doesn't want his team to use that against him in perf. I'm going to be honest, I don't even recognize this company anymore.

","The downside is management is awful. My manager has been good thankfully, but they run as a whole like every manager is your manager and I don’t agree with that. We get an incentive plan based on metrics which encourages cheating and nothing being done about it. Favoritism is key. They say promoting every 9 months is easy and it’s not. Of course your PTO comes down to metrics, the better you are, the more likely you are to get what you want.

I remain deeply impressed by the visionary leadership of Richard Fairbanks and his legendary annual strategy sessions. These are phenomenal. There is a drive and push to be clear and transparent in how Capital One communicates with its customers and with themselves. I have never seen this so evident at any other company before. My personal struggle with Capital One was due to multiple re-organizations happening every 3-6 months while I was dealing with severe elder care issues. It made it very difficult to demonstrate effective growth in my ever-changing teams and different scope while I was often out of the office for personal reasons. I am grateful that they stuck by me for as long as they did and they gave such incredible work life balance to let me be present with my parent in their time of need. However, it was clear that if I wasn't seeking to be promoted rather than stay in level for a while or lean back - to deal with a temporary child or elder care issue - that I needed to move on. It also became clear that if I wasn't in product management or have loads of bank experience that I needed to move on.

Mon Jun 08 2020, Product Management Manager,"Richmond, VA",Current Employee ,"Exceptional Benefits, Very Matrixed Org",4,"In most cases, some interesting work - most of the org really does try to 'Change Banking for Good'. Both the Richmond and McLean (the new one, M2) are amazing places to work with countless amenities, think kombucha on tap, medical centers, gym, collegiate-like campus with bikes to ride from bldg to bldg for your meetings. Shuttle buses are available between the campuses so when you do need to get to Richmond for a meeting, just hop on the shuttle in the morning and catch it in the afternoon to get back. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. Even in comparison to large tech firms (Apple, Google, etc.) Capital One offers similar or in most scenarios, more benefits. Work life balance is pretty great depending on your team, general start time is 9am and employees are encouraged to take the time they need to tend to family business. Hours and wfh can be flexible, but again depends on the team. Adoption assistance is up to $35k and they offer fertility benefits with up to 3 IVF rounds with meds included (no PGT testing unless you meet specific conditions, you need to utilize all embryos before doing a second IVF round, and all FETs are covered until the last round of IVF in which case they will only cover 1 more FET).
","Not necessarily a con, but need to be aware of the environment - it is a very matrixed organization. So most teams don't have full ownership over what they are building and will need to collaborate very heavily with multiple other teams because another product owner will have accountability over the vertical while you own the horizontal. This causes projects to take much longer than they might otherwise. This also means that if your Sr. Dir. isn't very strong, you likely won't be able to your projects to move forward if discussions have to move up the chain. The YE rating system is cut-throat. You need to prep and stay prepped all year. Make sure you are socializing your work to every single person you can. It will come down to stack ranking with a required 5-15% needing to be rated lower than 'meets expectations'. If you keep upping your game every year, you'll be fine but that may mean taking on external public speaking engagements, leading projects that will have massive business impact that can be 100% accounted to you alone (you'll get docked if someone else can share credit, which is in a matrix is hard to not share credit). I've seen people with $100MM in project value get average ratings so know that you aren't coming here to go with the flow....if you do, you won't last more than a year.

We actually have too many product managers, IMO. It feels like you can find 10+ product managers who all claim to own the same exact functionality and are then shocked to learn about each other's existence.

Performance ranking “calibrations” are painful processes and pit teammates against one another. 

Middle management either micro manages or is entirely disengaged. No in between.

The public persona of the company (culture) is not consistent across the organization.

No rhyme or reason to leveling or layoffs.

You’ve got some great talent on staff and you could benefit from actually listening to the long time bankers - some know a thing or two about what you’re trying to do. Sometimes reimagining Banking can be detrimental to your clients.

","I chose Capital One as the HR reps who visited my school touted it as a really healthy, progressive environment that differentiated itself from the old school finance way. I was a part of the rotational program so I got to experience several parts of the bank. 

The most major issue I experienced was sexual harassment. My first week on one of my rotations, there was a work happy hour and a senior male commented that I “was going to be his second wife.” Then, in the office, another senior male made a sexually charged comment. I told my manager about it and a sexual harassment case was filed but there was no real resolution other than he had to stay away from me. For the rest of the rotation, he bad mouthed me (even to the interns that were there for the summer). I heard quite a few racist and sexist remarks that he either announced publicly or someone else would tell me how uncomfortable they were by something he said to them as well. Yet, nothing was done. After I left, I received a request to pay back some of my compensation for leaving early. I called HR to see if we could come to some sort of agreement as I had left early to get out of a toxic work environment but they “had no record of the sexual harassment case.” Ultimately I ended up just paying it in full so I could move on and not have to worry about fighting with Capital One anymore. Overall, I was disappointed by how they handled this incident.

Also, they market Capital One as a place motivated people come to build something great. Most of the people I encountered were people who came from big banks who were now ready to take it easy in a less intense environment. It didn’t really feel like a place to start your career and learn from the best. 

Last thing, performance reviews are very subjective and not transparent. If you don’t have a manager who has your back, you’ll struggle to feel fully valued. I tried to communicate with my manager early on and was constantly told that my work product was timely and of great quality and that I would likely receive the highest ranking, though it wasn’t set in stone. At the end of the rotation, I suddenly got a lower ranking because “I asked too many questions when I should be trying to problem solve on my own” when my male counterpart (who several times turned in projects late and spent most of his time on linkedin looking for other jobs or facebook) got a higher ranking than me. All the other feedback was the same as throughout the rotation but I was downgraded for that reason (even though it was never communicated to me when I asked). Looking back, it just seems like a weird process to me as I ask more questions than ever in my new job (and my manager has commented on it) yet I still get the highest rating because of my timely, solid work product. 

I now work at one of those “old school” financial institutions and it’s a much more meritocratic and supportive environment than either of my teams at Capital One (plus to be blunt, the pay is better). Looking back, I learned a good lesson and found my way but I think I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I just started off in a big bank.
