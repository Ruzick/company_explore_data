","No room for advancement, not very diverse, not inclusive. You definitely have to ""drink the Koolaid"" and be popular to get anywhere in this company. They treat employees as numbers, not people. They only care about the bottom line. Massive COVID-19 layoff when the company stock was still performing well. They chose people at random to layoff rather than getting input from direct managers on who would be OK to cut. Micromanaging like crazy on some teams. Most management does not think you're working if they can't see you.
Advice to Management
Start treating your employees like human beings rather than numbers. Get with the century and technology and allow fully remote workers - it's cheaper for the company not to pay for giant buildings. Change your slogan - 5 years out does not represent the way you run your business.

Raises have not happen for a few years now, always promises but nothing. Upsetting when you see the huge bonuses senior leadership gets even during covid. With the company doing well, even in covid, you'd expect something and a job well done.

How is this place not drowning in lawsuits or maybe it is. Absurd. Mr. Mike Long is disconnected from reality on what goes on in his company.

Management’s response from the beginning has essentially been reactive, requiring remote work only at the very last second when it was mandated by the Governor. It shows that they do not really care about employees’ well being. Profit > people.

In the handful of years during my employment, not once did we have a fire drill during working hours. Think about that for a second.

Poor healthcare benefits with deduction upto $200 per pay check for family. Management culture run by perception and not by actual deliverables of employee on their roles and responsibilities. For a fortune 150 company, its a shame that they do have a development program attracting young talents plus any leadership development programs for developing future leaders of organisation within the org. Perhaps one reason would be is that at one point, arrow decided not to invest on education of employees after recession. 2009 Long term employees of Arrow who have spent 20/30/40 years haven't seen another fortune 110 company nor ever worked for a fortune 110 company and average of 3.0 rating in glass door usually comes from them because of their stability and in other words ignorance.

","As an experienced professional, I thought I knew the right questions for vetting a prospective employer, but clearly I missed the mark on this one. While most employers try to paint themselves in a positive light, it is only in retrospect that I understand just how severe and numerous the misrepresentations were at Arrow – from the recruiting process onward. Opacity seems to be the modus operandi and questionable business practices are so engrained in the culture, they have become normalized. Either the chief decision makers are woefully out of touch with the true culture of their Company or they simply don’t care. I tend to think it is the latter. 
To assist in the decision-making process for anyone thinking about accepting a position with Arrow Electronics, I’ve highlighted the main areas of frustration based on my experience. But in short, read and listen to the reviews – it is as bad as people indicate. The reviews aren’t just written by a few “bad apples” that are upset – there are numerous, deeply-rooted, systemic issues at Arrow that you should seriously consider before deciding to work here.

Misrepresentation #1: “Arrow is a Tech Company – we’re like Google” – Firstly, Arrow Electronics is not a Tech Company – their customers and vendors are Tech Companies, but Arrow is a supply chain manager. They ship electronic widgets from Point A to Point B – plain and simple. There is a small segment of their business that adds value to these electronic widgets but by and large the innovation is coming from the businesses Arrow contracts with, NOT Arrow. Publicly however, you may have been intrigued by the “5-Years Out” video distributed by HR or maybe you saw that commercial for the solar suitcase or the race car – nothing in those publications is representative of the day-to-day – merely marketing gimmicks. If you join Arrow thinking you’ll be part of this “innovation” or the general attitude that comes with innovative tech companies, you will be sorely mistaken. Which brings me to my next point…
In contrast, Google IS a Tech Company and their culture mirrors that. They’ve built a work environment that is flexible, empowers their employees to think outside the box, encourages them to think proactively and trusts them to pursue excellence in their respective fields. You will find NONE of these traits at Arrow. It is a stodgy, rigid, 1950s hierarchical organization that rewards blind adherence to orders from executives, lacks any sense of flexibility or openness to new ideas and one that actively discourages and retaliates against any who dare to buck the status quo. They rule with fear and control – threatening to take your job, smear your name, or sabotage your career. 
If you need just one example, take COVID-19. Google is flexible and caring enough to allow employees that can work from home to do so until at least the end of 2020. Arrow, on the other hand, tried to mandate a return to the office, while still under a shelter-in-place order. They’ve even gone so far as to disallow exceptions due to child care challenges or vulnerable individuals in the household. I’m sure vulnerable individuals will be mandated next.

Misrepresentation #2: “Diversity and Inclusion is Our Number One Priority” – Denver, Colorado is not exactly a diverse place to begin with but coupled with a complete and utter lack of concern for actually making a workplace diverse or inclusive, this statement is just laughable. For a Company that ranks this as their NUMBER ONE priority, you would think they might observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day or at least post some inspirational message on their social media about his contributions to diversity and equality. Nope. Or maybe recognize Autism Awareness Month? Cesar Chavez Day? Asian Pacific American Heritage Month? Pride Month? Nope, nope, nope and…..nope. Being diverse and inclusive encompasses a lot of territory, but apparently, Arrow has decided the better option is to just reject all forms or diversity and inclusivity.
And this is of course excluding the plethora of recent events (post-May 2020) which Arrow could have used to strengthen their stance on diversity and inclusion but instead they have chosen to remain silent. Deafening silence. Observing Juneteenth? Not Arrow. 
We get it – Arrow Electronics is a good ol’ boys club and you want to keep it that way. Just don’t slap some trendy buzz phrase out there that diversity and inclusion is a top priority because CLEARLY it isn’t.

Misrepresentation #3: “Ethics and Honesty are Core Values” – In my opinion, profit at any cost and haphazardness would be more accurate descriptors of Arrow’s “core values”. We take compliance training classes like every other place, but it’s window dressing. Without getting into specifics, the substantive actions of people in positions of authority, managers and above, blatantly demonstrate that their actions are not even remotely guided by ethical behavior or honesty. Their actions are guided by profit. And while some might argue that is true for most of Corporate America, I would ask you to stop and consider, when the last time someone at your job or in your career asked you to do something that was glaringly wrong? Something that made you morally uncomfortable and could result in serious consequences if these actions were to be made public? 
Of the many times that I’ve confronted my supervisor about this, I’m always given the same corporate puppetry lines that have been highly edited, filtered and polished so as to remain meaningless and opaque. Transparency and candor are foreign concepts at Arrow. To further compound this issue, is a perpetual desire to act before thinking plans through, which creates an endless series of confusion, ambiguity and an overall lack of personal accountability for pretty much every aspect of the business.

Listen to your employees, and stop the fear of retaliatory consequences. 

How about not requiring employees to come in to the office just to have warm bodies there, when most all have proven to be extremely efficient at working remote. Rumor has it that the major reason for forcing folks back to the office is simply because you’re concerned about having empty real estate. How about renting out office space that is currently needed, or does that go against the “Five Years Out” mantra?

Arrow really needs to re-think their whole work/life balance policies, times are changing, and you should want to outshine your competitors, but guess that isn’t what’s most important to management. Just continue to tick off the employees, hoping maybe they’ll continue to quit, and you can fill the positions with contractors. What a joke. Arrow has proven they have little regard for the resentment that a lot of the employees are harboring right now. 

If I’ve learned anything over the last couple of years, it’s that Arrow has, as someone else stated in previous reviews, become a company where excellent employees come to have their souls crushed.

","""Arrow Electronics Again Tops Industry Ranking in FORTUNE’s World’s Most Admired Companies List 2020""

Who are they surveying with this list, because it is certainly NOT anybody that works at Arrow.


For a company that moved its headquarters to Colorado in 2011 one would think the executive team would have addressed the massive increase in the cost of living in the state in the last nine years. That is not the case with Arrow. The corporate offices are in one of the most expensive states to live, and while executives are able to live here easily, regular employees are living paycheck to paycheck and working multiple jobs just to keep a roof over their head. Questions regarding this directly to the CFO have been met with uncomfortable laughter and the direction to go to HR. What may have been considered ""competitive"" pay 15 years ago is now entry level for this industry, even in the most rural parts of the country; yet is still being utilized company-wide. Calls and emails praising the company and employees for ""record profits year over year"" and massive seven-figure bonuses to the CEO and top executive team are mirrored with no raises and the thought of a bonus laughable to everyone below. 

But hey, you can wear jeans for an extra day next week, great work.

Even a standard cost of living raise is non-existent. While rent prices can so much as double year over year, salary remains stagnant. If you are one of the few who finds an internal promotion that somehow isn't a ""lateral"" movement in salary, the most you can expect to see is a 5% increase on average. Wage negotiation does not exist and is considered an insult to the hiring managers, you are offered what you are offered, take it or leave it.

If you live in the Denver Metro area you are guaranteed to have seen the Arrow logo somewhere. The money spent on advertising and marketing to establish brand recognition is astonishing, yet brand recognition does nothing if nobody knows what the company does. They are advertising a useless, unexplainable brand at the zoo, baseball and football games, Indy cars, etc. The common person does not shop at Arrow. The common person, if intrigued by the brand somewhere, will google the company and realize it means nothing to them, close their browser and move on with their life. The company is so focused on putting its name on everything that it fails to understand ""Five Years Out"" is a useless attempt at a buzz phrase that not even the executives can explain in ten words or less, much less non-employees even understand the meaning behind it.

Employees are expected to take mandatory ethics courses quarterly, oftentimes the courses themselves are amusing as you run through the examples of ethics violations and try to find one that you haven't been asked to do, or witnessed personally. Arrow may preach ethics standards, but they certainly do not practice it internally. ""So-and-so said this needs to be done, get it done"" usually with ""so-and-so"" being a VP or higher, we are expected to comply. Any questions are first met with assurance that it's ok because it came from VP so and so, that it will ""be correct on the back-end"", followed then by hostility. Managers and above have been known to retaliate against defiance, some even with records in HR stating employees feel retaliated against, but they remain employed as of the time I left. The fear of retaliation is so strong that many employees, in my experience, would rather proceed with questionable behavior than raise an issue among their direct management or within HR itself. HR is a resource to protect the company, not the employees. What used to be dedicated HR personnel is now a generic inbox. In my time I had no less than a dozen different HR contacts assigned to myself and my group, until the turnaround became so great a generic HRconnect email was created.


Not everything used to be like this. This used to be a fun company to work for, I used to be proud to say I worked for Arrow, one of Colorado's largest employers. Halloween used to be a very big deal, where the entire night before and day of was dedicated to groups decorating (oftentimes extremely elaborate - the pirate ship?) entire sections of the building to the point where it is unrecognizable as an office. Employees were heavily encouraged to bring their families and children through the buildings in the early afternoon to see the decorations and trick-or-treat through the cubicles and offices. It was something that everyone looked forward to. The last few years have been either ""No decorations"" or the day before ""you can decorate if you like"". No elaborate displays, very few children coming through, it has lost the magic and nobody at the top seems concerned to bring it back. Every year each department would have a large holiday party (think typical corporate event: Hotel, food, drinks, raffles... a fun holiday party where spouses were more than welcome). The only ones that are held anymore and strictly for executives, if any department wishes to do something it now comes from the pockets of the directors and middle management, nothing Arrow sponsored for the lesser employees exists. I don't know what is worse, being a more recent employee and never having experience the ""fun"" side of Arrow, or having experienced that and watching it devolve into a soulless corporate office over the last few years.

Arrow used to hold an extremely competitive benefits package. I guess it still does if you're an executive ($6,000,015 in equity awarded to the CEO last year). We had sabbaticals. We had stock provided to us after a year. We were part of the company. These were taken away without an explanation. Even the tenured employees weren't grandfathered in to the sabbatical program. Healthcare used to be decent, expensive but provided adequate coverage. Then around 2014 they switched to ""high deductible"" plans across the board. Now nobody I know of goes to the doctor unless they absolutely must. Nobody can afford to pay the monthly dues, on top of thousands of dollars for their deductible, just for their insurance to finally start chipping in. It's cheaper for Arrow though, bonus.



*********COVID-19 RESPONSE***********

I have seen a lot of reviews showing up after Arrow decided to show how much their employees matter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are true. All of them. Given the choice, the CEO would have kept the offices open and at full capacity throughout this entire crisis. Luckily, 100% of the employees at the corporate offices have the capability to work remote, so when the state ordered offices to be temporarily shut down, Arrow had to comply. However production did not miss a beat, because of the aforementioned ability of remote working.

However.

As soon as the state order was to be lifted, emails were sent out saying employees are to return to work the day the order is lifted. Arrow Electronics is headquartered in Arapahoe County. Arapahoe County pushed the closure out another week, from May 11th to May 18th. Arrow was then self-declared an ""essential business"" (???) and therefore should not be held to the standards of the lockdown...even though, as stated before, all employees had been working remote the prior month and a half. The date of reopening Arrow was pushed out another week, most likely due to an order from the health department, and further measures were to be taken to ensure ""employee safety and corporate compliance"". May 18th, expected to have 50% of employees returned to the office, unless you had a medical or caretaking exception. On June 1st, those exceptions expired and any further exceptions became more strict. If you had a child with no school or summer care due to COVID-19 closures, that was no longer a reason for you not to be in the office. If you lived with people who were high risk, that was no longer a reason to work remote. Unless you had a signed doctor's note, on a specific form derived from Arrow, you had no excuse and must return to the office. Working remote was no longer to be an option every week; in compliance with the minimum state orders, the return was to be 50% of the time...every other week. Badges were to be scanned and monitored to ensure everyone had returned to the office. Everyone, that is, except for the executive team. Their top level floor is off limits to regular employees so nobody knows for sure if they have been in or not. Should probably monitor their badges too.

Arrow's competitor, Avnet? Their employees are continuing to work remotely through the rest of the year. Mouser? Working remote for the rest of the year. Digikey? Remote for the rest of the year.

Avnet cares about their employees and their community. Mouser cares about their employees and their community. Digikey cares about their employees and their community.

Arrow? A decade ago I would have said yes. A year ago I would have been able to trick myself into believing they do. This year? It's clear they do not.

As much as Arrow cares about their image, this would have been a prime opportunity to garner free publicity and good faith with the community and state as a whole. News stations eat it up when a large company treats its employees like humans. Flexibility during this crisis would have made a mention and interview on 9news. Now your employees are ticked and feel betrayed. You might not care if we quit, that's one less mediocre benefits package you have to pay, but we will carry this animosity with us for life.

All they care about is moving up for themselves - they have been there for years, there is no strategy EVER! You never see or hear from executives EVER! They fund projects by putting out fires, each day you don't know which project gets money for the short-term and then pull it right back when some other executive screams louder. Hideous example of leadership. Layoffs constantly because they have no idea what their bottom line is!! seriously, ask Finance. And don't let me go on about their IT infrastructure - it's a mess. it's 20 years behind and patched up. No real data anywhere. It's all a big fasad and will come crashing down, which will ultimately crash the entire company. If I could give less than a 1 I would! Ignore the good reviews, they are fake!

","Arrow has decided to classify themselves as an ""essential business"" and are forcing their employees to return to the office although we have full capability to work from home. This is completely irresponsible and goes against governor Polis' orders to maximize telecommuting whereever possible. Also, the so called ""temp checks"" being performed before you enter the building are completely bogus and inaccurate. The way Arrow has handled this situation is extremely dissapointing especially when you see how other large companies are adapting to protect the health of their employees.

Advice to Management
Arrow planned to open last week, however they were quickly shut down by the State Department because it was an unsafe environment - not because of the uproar that they heard from employees who were scared to go in. Despite orders by our governor that masks are required when you cannot guarantee employees remain 6 feet apart, Arrow is not requiring this. Arrow cannot guarantee that we remain 6 feet apart. We have many shared spaces like bathrooms, kitchens, elevators, stairwells, etc that are much smaller than a 6x6 space. Arrow now plans to open its offices on Monday, May 11th. I will wear a mask for the safety of my peers, but there is no requirement for them to do the same for me. As I'm writing, our Governor is holding a press conference and just stated, ""There are no substitutions for people doing the right thing, wearing masks ... the more people that do the right thing, the sooner we can relax restrictions and the fewer people will die."" Colorado Gov Polis. Apparently, Arrow is above the law.

Arrow doesn't care about the health and safety of its employees, or who dies. They're more concerned that their employees sit at their desks and dial into the same virtual meetings that they would dial into from home. My friends and peers in the Colorado area are not facing this with their employers. Instead, they leave it to the employee to determine what is or isn't safe for them. I am applying at many of these companies and I'd assume my peers are as well. I will leave Arrow as soon as I have another job, if they don't lay me off first. Don't get me started on the layoffs. 

Shame on you, Arrow. Shame on you.

Put a ticket in is all we hear. You spend way to much on advertising..race cars..and supporting other foundations. Then when qtr looks bad, you lay off people to get the books out of the red.

","The culture at Arrow Digital is about as toxic as it gets. If you're into whispering and gossiping, this is the place for you! Onsite benefits like workout facilities are pretty useless for some teams because other teammates are noticing if you're not at your desk and reporting the ""unexcused absence"" up the chain. This is encouraged by management. 

Arrow Digital Management is spinning its wheels, providing no strategic direction to the team, resulting in 3 rounds of layoffs during my short time with the digital organization. Their poor handling of their business is rewarded with bonuses and continued employment, while the people working long hours (without the possibility of a bonus) are watching their friends and co-workers leave without even being allowed to grab their coats on their way out. Arrow Digital understands at-will employment and eliminates jobs on the reg, providing a cushiony 3 day window for families to find new health insurance. 

I don't know much about Mike Long, but I would provide two thumbs down to the Chief Digital Officer & President, Matt Anderson. He built the site well from scratch, but hasn't been able to run the business successfully since. His leadership is defined by hiding in his office (across a major street from his team) and then screaming at individuals, often half his age, during meetings.

","This was a fun place to work a few years ago but after some bad hires and worse managerial moves, it has become a very toxic place to be. Sound technical decisions have been replaced by massive egos and mistake after mistake.

Instead, people are either being let go during a mass layoff or leaving on their own in search of a better culture where their experience and skills matter.

Tue Jun 25 2019, Annuity Specialist,"Centennial, CO",Former Employee ,My Experience at Arrow,9,"Arrow offers a reasonable wage and raise structure. The benefits were also good.
","Management did not care about their employees. My team was constantly under staffed and overwhelmed. This in turn led to more turnover on my team, which of course led to more stress being placed on the rest of us. There were several times that my team asked upper management to let us bring on more people, but we were routinely rejected. At best they would let us bring on one person, instead of the two or three the we needed. Ultimately, my entire team turned over twice in the year that I was at Arrow. That's nearly 20 people that came and left. Additionally, there was no formal training for my position. We were mainly left to rely on veteran members of the team for guidance. This led to excessive frustration between our clients and us, as they expected a standard of service that new, unexperienced, members of the team were unable to provide. Finally, since leaving Arrow, they have withheld my final paycheck for almost a month now. It has been nearly impossible to get a straight answer from anyone regarding why this has been happening, and the points of contact that they provided me with have largely ignored me.
Advice to Management

 *It is so big it is hard to find the right people to talk to.
 *IT is outsourced to India, if you have a problem you have to call India before 
 getting actual help.
 *You are just a number in a crowd. Upper management has no idea who you are 
 or what you do... nor do they really care.
-In sales they do everything they possibly can to avoid paying you your 
 Commission.
 *There is a 60/40 split for on target earnings. you have to hit 60% of your 
 assigned quota to even be paid out. 
 *No one can tell you how this quota is calculated.
 *It is almost always a struggle to get paid the correct amount, you have 
 to fight for it.
 *As mentioned above, finding the right person to help you get paid is difficult 
-When I was in inside sales I had an incredible manager but our team was 
 understaffed so there was no work life balance. There were no funds for the 
 team to hire anyone else so there was no end in sight and no support for an 
 awesome manager.

","Wow, I don’t know where to start, so here goes. I worked Big 4 before I came to Arrow. I was told to ignore all of the negative postings & any other rumors that disparaged Arrow. Guess what, those awful rumors & stories were right. In fact they were spot on. If you are still an employee at Arrow, you will know exactly what I’m talking about. 5 years out, the biggest joke ever!!!!! What does that even mean??? No one knows. I worked with some (& the key word is some) people who are decent. The rest of you, not so much. How will you find out you are working for a bad company? Two words, month-end. Guess what, Arrow has hard deadlines, if you have to stay at work until 2 am, to close the month, guess what, you are staying at work until 2 am. Are you a parent, do you have other responsibilities like you have 2 of the worlds greatest dogs, you love like family? Doesn’t matter & don’t even think about checking on them on coming back. I put up with this for 2 years. The longest 2 years of my life. Vacation??? Ha yeah, try long-weekends. This is a company that rumors spread like wildfire. Sad. The constant threat of firings & lay-offs is like nothing else I have every experienced. This is also a company that loves to rely on temps. Nothing against temps, but the temps are held over the full-time employees as a threat. “You screw up, we have plenty of people that will gladly take your job”. FYI - most of the temps, never get converted to full-time status. Are you like me & you are thinking about coming over from Big 4, regional or local CPA firms? Don’t!!!!!! Don’t even think about it. You will thank me later. In fact run like heck & don’t look back. So many great companies would love & be lucky to have someone like you, but not this dumpster fire. I can go on and on. Read the negative reviews. They are all spot on. Who wrote the positive reviews? Seriously, do you even work for the company or are you in HR or marketing & were told to write them? Shame on you. Working at Arrow took a couple of years off my life. I’m convinced of that. Ask yourself this, why does Arrow have some of the lowest ratings on Glassdoor & some of the most dreadful reviews of any company? It’s because it’s an awful place to work.
Advice to Management
I find this question to be hysterical. I mean upper management loves to use cliches & key business words I’ve only ever heard while getting my MBA. Talk is cheap. Get rid of the bad employees instead of promoting them. When half a Department quits in one year, ask yourself why. Do a real employee survey & exit interviews. Read these negative reviews on Glassdoor & you will notice a consistency in the postings. If you truly want Arrow to be a great company, you can do it. Constant employee turnover is a real cost, relying on endless temp employees & using them as a threat, is a real cost. It’s not to late to save a once great company & it all starts at the top.

","Company is in constant change with no clear direction from management from the C-Suite down. The motto should be updated to ""One Quarter Out,"" but I think that's the clear understanding of most of the employees left. This used to be an amazing company that truly understood the value of it's employees and how to engage and promote employee satisfaction, but no more. Now it's very clear that executives and management here view employees as a highly disposable number.

-Bi-annual and quarterly layoffs 
-Layoffs aren't generally structure to target low-performers, just high-cost employees, so a lot of knowledge gets lost leading to high employee stress, more employee turnover, and poor performance when it comes to meeting customer expectations.
-People constantly leaving due to shear frustration
-Poor morale among employees, with many stressed and extremely overworked covering positions that are rarely intended to be back-filled.
-Poor middle-management
-Overworked senior management
-Absent executive management
-Constant workload issues leading to no life balance
-If you do have work/life balance, know that you'll probably be laid off and your position will be off-shored to a team in India. 
-HR team is useless
-Little upward mobility, with some lateral movement available.
-Promotion isn't generally based on merit, but more on who you know and how much you suck up.
-Don't expect a pay raise or annual increase
-Do expect constant re-orgs with less and less direction each time
-Working in sales, sometimes your commission check is right but more often than not it's way off in either direction. Sometimes they fix it though.

The list goes on and on but I think you get the picture.
Advice to Management
I think the Board should really look at where this company wants, clearly and openly define that direction for the workforce to align with, and to invest in resources (including management) to help get us there. If you ask us to jump for the moon but give us a management team that ties us to the ground, it doesn't work well for either party involved.

On-Site café (Pro depending on the day and menu...)

Arrow is a Fortune brand; it's good resume fodder.

Pays slightly higher than average for Denver. Good thing too, otherwise they'd never have new hires.
","Oh the things to say about Arrow, where to begin? Let's start with the basics: Arrow is not the company it was even five years ago. There are some things you can expect to see if you join this organization:

• An ingrained backwards-thinking middle management.
o Many of the managers in this company were hired as a result of mergers and acquisitions. They are ill-suited for managing in some cases, and ill-fit for managing organizations >200 employees in far more.

o Expect attitudes of “this is how we do it at Arrow” and “you can’t fight city hall” from this special group of individuals.


o CYA is the name of the game. Many of these managers want to keep their heads down as falling in line is occasionally rewarded, and risk-taking in any fashion is strictly punished. 

o HR consistently takes management’s side in any disputes. It’s part of the culture.


o If your manager doesn’t support a recommendation or idea you have, it dies on the table. You’ll then be called into a room and told your manager wanted that idea dead, because THEY feel the company has different needs. Even if they've chosen to take no action for years.

o Is your manager specialized in say Operations or Finance? Have they been successful in that role in the past? Expect their next step of advancement to be a complete change in discipline, and when they fail, it will be their employees’ fault. Managers frequently are unsuitable for roles they are placed in, which are “loosely related” to positions they’ve been successful in in the past.


o There is NO accountability. At least not in the traditional sense. If you upset your manager for any reason, no matter how unrelated to the job, you’ll be disciplined. But if IT doesn’t fix your issue for weeks at a time, your co-worker doesn’t feel like towing the company line, or someone’s favorite is involved (pretty much anyone in IT really), no action will be taken.

o Pray that your manager isn’t one of the many passive-aggressive types that have banded together to protect each other and hire more of their ilk. They are plentiful and problematic.


• A homogenous, fear-driven, defeated and uncreative IT team.

o Are you eager to show your innovative chops in an IT organization? Advance within a company to higher echelons of management? Help the business by providing world-class IT support and flexible, intelligent solutions? 

o Well, unless you’re male, middle-aged and East Indian, this is the WRONG company for you, because that makes up the majority of our IT. 


o Due to the above, female employees may experience exceptional challenges in our IT organization. On paper Arrow is diverse, in practice, …no. I’ve watched said Indian males (three times now) place their hand in front of women’s faces to say “stop”. HR action taken? Well, none of those women are still with Arrow now.

o If hired, expect to work long hours, while falsifying how long projects actually take (because projects have to come in “on budget”, even if the numbers used are pure fiction).


o You can also expect to work with a number of contractors. Arrow is on a perpetual hiring freeze (unannounced to most) in order to drive Operative Expense reporting on the P&L lower, to please K-Street.

o Expect to hear how we “don’t have resources” frequently. We don’t have them, but we sure as hell won’t hire them either!


o There are problems in direction and vision within IT leadership. What is said by senior-most leadership is not supported or followed throughout the entire organization. Act on the complaints you've received.

o Lessons learned at the end of the project: “1. We’ll look at the lessons learned next time.” Rinse, repeat. IT doesn’t learn from its mistakes, it commonly keeps coming up with new ways to make more.

o Changes will be made in the production system, either untested or not fully tested. In Arrow, IT pushing code ""on-time"" is more important than actually fixing the problem correctly. 

o Note on the above, it isn't the testing team's fault as development ignores testers when code fails test.

o Information is intentionally hidden from the business. How many hours will something take, when can it be started, how often is something happening, when will an issue be completely fixed? If there’s data, accountability can be created, so IT leaves all but senior executives in the dark.

o Did I mention IT works on what it wants, when it wants, and if the business tells it to do something differently, they refuse? The business works for IT, IT does NOT work for the business. Why? It's been stated it’s because IT knows better than the business does what the business needs.


• Disconnected and delusional senior management.

o On a recent web broadcast, the senior management team decided to explain a round of layoffs that took out many multi-decade employees as “We made a mistake. These are people we didn’t have jobs for and shouldn’t have filled positions. It was our error and we needed to do this to take responsibility for it.” Funny, the VP’s that made the decision are still employed, but a large number of line employees aren’t. Sounds like the employees, not the executives took responsibility for VP’s screw-ups to me.

o Expect on said web broadcasts to hear an hour-long string of buzz works and no real meat of what is actually being done in the organization. “Internet of Things”, “synergistic”, “solutions-based”, “five years out”…

o Everything is five years out, especially any budget being allocated to fix existing problems. Arrow is constantly moving forward, always without fixing and cleaning up after projects and initiatives it just finished or long ago implemented but never properly stood up. 


• And if you’re working in the business unit…
o Expect to frequently have systems go down or break, and to then spend days, weeks, months or years waiting on IT to get around to fixing it.

o Reporting? Use Excel, we’re “Five Years Out”, because that’s how long it takes before anyone in IT will even look at it. This is a running joke throughout the organization.

o New building in Centennial, several electric car docks outside, organization revenue was ~$24B last I checked; but we “don’t have the resources”.

o Only executive pet projects get approved or worked on, get used to it.


o IT to TELL you what the fix to a problem is, even if you know the customer/partner better than they do. IT gives you the fix IT wants to give, not what Arrow needs. 

o Only certain personally-preferred vendors and products are selected by IT. If your recommendation isn’t on that list, suddenly everything else is “too expensive”. Mind you, that never has to be backed up with research. It’ll just be called disqualified due to expense and you’ll be shouted down if you ask again.


• Some other things:
o During 2016-2017, the Employee Handbook was updated to remove all references to severance packages. No announcements were made of this change.

o During 2018, all employees are expected to go into the HR system and electronically acknowledge having read the Employee Handbook; multiple announcements were made regarding this change.


o Character assassination of employees who don’t drink the kool aid is a daily occurrence, eventually resulting in resignations or terminations. Just keep reminding yourself you were hired for your “previous experience and insights”. Arrow wants a variety of feedback, so long as it agrees with the agenda; and it had better!

o Little accountability at the lowest sales levels. If they don’t do their jobs, either managers or operational staff have to do it for them. Since there’s no accountability, the cycle of not doing their jobs continues on.


o IT systems go offline during work hours. Why? Because IT doesn’t want to work late of course…

o Expect security updates which only let you delay for 30 minutes to be pushed to your machine under the same logic.


o Need access to some program or secured folder? Access requests take days or weeks. Employees are not a priority, unless they’re Director or above.

o In 2018 Arrow announced a ""payroll shift""; which amounted to stealing a full week of pay from every employee in the company, drastically increasing Arrow's cash flow at its employees' expense. Underhanded, unethically and while I suspect not necessarily illegal, it should be.
Advice to Management
Start holding your senior and middle-management accountable. The company is stagnant because too many senior executives have been in their positions and the company as a whole for far too long. Change starts from the top down, and while Arrow constantly preaches about innovation, you have stalwart status-quo executives holding the reins. 

Stop retaining burned or disgruntled talent from mergers and acquisitions. You have power-hungry middle-managers who are bent out of shape they used to be executives and now aren't. So they spend their waking hours taking it out on productive employees.

Stop retaining burned or disgruntled talent from mergers and acquisitions. You have power-hungry middle-managers who are bent out of shape they used to be executives and now aren't. So they spend their waking hours taking it out on productive employees.

Short-term sales revenue approach by Senior Management.

Senior Management does not understand the significant value of Outside Sales, Inside Sales, and Marketing working together as one sales team. 
 
This is reflected by an individual sale approach vs. a focused and strategic long-term client account strategy to grow the business. 

The result of a lack of a focused go-to-market strategy and silo's leads to a lack of productivity for sales into both existing clients and new business development.

You have to re-inventing the wheel every time you need a customer reference, responding to a request for proposal etc. Which is a requirement for most large companies (multiple bids).

There is also a need to develop corporate relationships with Business Consulting Firms and large System Integrators like IBM Global Solutions, E&Y, Accenture, etc. as partners to grow market share in Fortune 500 /1000 accounts. They are already in major accounts helping to solve problems and develop corporate strategies.

Pay is good but the health benefits are terrible for how much the employee pays
Advice to Management
They don't take advice. Here are my comments. They have lay-offs almost quarterly. What they seem to like to do is hire a ton of people without defining their roles and then just lay off the people they actually never needed to hire. This is especially horrible for people who have left a steady job or relocated to work for Arrow. Had I known that the lay-offs were so frequent, I would have never taken the job. I saw the reviews here and asked about it during my interview but it was explained to me that the digital group is totally independent, they have tons of funding, they have a lot of work that needs to be done, and they are so cool and hip. 

If you define “hip” as having a ping pong table and a scooter in the office, then this is the place for you… for up to a year until they do lay-offs. It’s disheartening to see that even after this last round of lay-offs, they are still hiring for the same groups. They are either hiring the wrong people or they just don’t understand the value of a human. After working with some of the very talented people there, I believe it is the latter. I watched a lot of talented people be laid off when they could have either been moved into another position or just had better leadership. 

Women are treated like their ideas don’t matter. They are expected to behave in a demure manner so as not to hurt any of the fragile egos in the digital product and IT teams. They hired an e-commerce team with no e-commerce experience. Ego is so much a part of the culture, people get sensitive if they think you might be more knowledgeable. And then suddenly, you’re the problem for knowing what you’re doing and trying to do your job. 

I would say don’t even take the interview. They do pay well but it’s not a secure place to work. I can’t comment on the CEO but I will comment on the leadership for the digital group. They are spineless. They do not back up their own employees. They hire their buddies, both within the company and as vendors. The people who manage the vendors have no vote in the vendor selection so if their buddy happens to suck (and many do), you will end up looking like the problem as there is no loyalty.

People who, after decades of amazing service, were told OVER THE PHONE when their last day of employment would be. 
People who held on even though raises weren't happening and budgets were far beyond grasp. Someone pointed out that their ""5 Years Out"" program wasn't to achieve better in 5 years...it was a countdown to how many years left before you got laid off. I'm talking to you, current employees - management fails to listen, and everyone is replaceable. Get out and find an employer that will treat you (and all of it's employees) better.

If you choose to accept an applications engineering position at Arrow use it as a stepping-stone with the goal of learning the industry, and then move into a supplier FAE role where your talent and expertise will be greatly appreciated and rewarded.
","Arrow is financial institution focused on sales numbers, not a engineering or design-driven establishment. It is all about sales and numbers and Wall Street, not engineering. They are 90% rules-based driven by metrics and as such reward mediocrity and conformance far more than innovation, competence, or performance and expertise in engineering. Negative reinforcement is the only incentive. It's a corporate culture from the top down based on bullying. If you are into sales you will be far better off than engineering, and will be regarded well better than applications engineers. My experience is they don't foster any career growth, there are few pay increases such that you won't even keep up with the cost of living. And as an applications engineer they will run you hot with the needle always pegged in the red and fail to recognize your accomplishments.
Advice to Management
Higher margins are what you are after with respect to engineering. So embrace what your engineers do for you. Let them engineer and design and promote sales through knowledge and technology. Keep FAEs out of admin, number tracking, and pure sales roles. Technology doubles at a rate of something less than every two years today. FAEs don't have time to be your handy-man or your clean-up crew like was the case many years ago. Your cheese has been moved. Evolve before you slip any farther behind. FAEs are there to get pre-sales print position, stay up with technology, stay up with products and new products, support customers and their designs by removing technical obstacles and pulling opportunities through the funnel to revenue while participating in the sales process from a technical perspective. Nothing more. That's how your suppliers use FAEs and if you are to succeed, you better get busy catching up and following suit. Every market will be different, so local empowerment is mandatory. And that means local management must be competent, motivated, have vision and ownership, coach, mentor, and support. What works in San Jose will not work in Wisconsin. Support, foster, recognize your FAEs skills and contributions at a corporate level and reward them, or resign yourselves to losing the talent you need most of all in lieu of a mediocre under-performing employee. Anyone in management from executive staff to the field that has been at Arrow more than five years needs to be re-trained or replaced. What you did five years ago won't work today. Your good stories and telling suppliers and employees alike what they want to hear, in spite of all your propaganda, is unsustainable and inappropriate in today's market. Either decide to make-good on all your engineering commitments and resource for it, or get your lack-luster website up-to-speed, resign yourself to declining margins, and prepare for E-commerce.

","Execs continue to talk out of both sides of their mouths, and continue to choose to be disconnected from the business. Talking about how great we are doing in ""town hall"" meetings, then how bad we suck day-to-day. Talking about retaining and investing in our good people, then those good people are rewarded with no raise and more work. THEN on the flip side, the low-performers (who would be fired in any other company for constantly under performing) are rewarded with more work taken OFF their plate because they can't handle it! And they talk in these Town Halls about Talent Management when deep down their goal is natural attrition....and it's working because all of your High Performers are leaving.

Then they sign these $100-$200M deals bringing new suppliers on to do business with Arrow (and scream at us that we have to win with these guys; high visibility on this new supplier), yet they won't allow managers/directors to hire any extra head count to help manage these new lines.

The employee reviews are a complete waste of everyone's time. Raises are based on how the company does YoY, and not individual performance. You do an excellent job, congrats, you get a 3% raise. You do not meet expectations in your review, congratulations, you get a 3% raise. If you put in your notice, that's when they all of a sudden have 15%-20% to offer you.

- cool start-up feel and comes with perks
- free snacks and drinks
- open warehouse seating 
- collaboration and teamwork encouraged
- good benefits
","Worked for the Arrow Digital/Ecommerce:
- poor management - direct manager had too much time to constantly micromanage, make poor managing decisions, provided very poor direction and could not simply answer questions, also believe that manager lacked the knowledge and skills to be in a leadership position so I'm pretty disappointed in Arrow for giving him a manager role - at least provide some training for new managers. 
- It seemed like the cool start up and relaxed environment was provided to only selective group of people whereas, my group's culture was more of a dictatorship brought on from my direct manager who was highly condescending, disrespectful, on a power trip, and extremely inflexible. all of this goes against their ""cool hip"" ""startup"" ""laid back"" culture. Direct manager used to ask me what type of appointments I had so he could tell me which type of PTO time I could use and I thought that was very invasive and would straight tell me to not even go to my appointments unless they were ""extremely"" important. If they weren't important, I wouldn't have bothered asking.
Advice to Management
If you're trying to make this whole Arrow Digital/Ecommerce large and actually trying to retain employees and keep them happy, please make sure the people you are choosing managers who have the knowledge and skillset to be in a leadership position. I cannot tell you how many times my entire team was so fed up with our direct manager's passive aggressive emails, remarks, lack of ability to provide any direction whatsoever, and lack of understanding towards situations. He insinuated that I was faking sick, lying, and threatened to terminate me. His constant poor attitude was adding to my stress levels and negatively impacting my ability to be productive. He has zero accountability and chooses favorites and seems like is bad at accepting a diverse workforce. So seems like he keeps hiring people that are recommended by the one or two employees he decides are his favorites.

If your lucky enough to get one of these managers they usually realize there are better opportunities elsewhere. They offer generous PTO but you'll never find time to take vacation.
","The managers at this company have a mindset that they've paid their dues and they are going to kick back. They make themselves look good on the work of their teams. While staff is working late you can find management taking off nice and early. Total double standard in terms of expectations. Expect your typical top heavy corporate culture here. Employees are miserable, unappreciated, underpaid, and overworked. Most people I have seen start at Arrow make it about 6 months. I have seen countless turnovers that result in consolidation of workload. This company believes a department already stretched thin can take two employees and turn the workload into one (but don't expect that consolidation to touch the manager level). Its not unheard of to work 8-9pm for extended periods of time. If you are reading this, take my advice and look elsewhere. You'll regret taking a job in either department. Arrow will promise you the world and probably even preach a ""work-life"" balance, it does not exist in the accounting or finance departments.

","Arrow is not a very rewarding company to work for. Specifically they have this corporate culture that doing your job, and doing it well, is not to be rewarded. If you do 100% of your job, that is considered average, and only people that are doing 150-200% are considered to be above average employees. They have no interest in taking an active role in perpetuating your career and expect the employee to be wholly responsible for pushing themselves forward. This seems like a minor complaint, but without guidance, mentorship, or any kind of positive reinforcement, this company really makes you feel like there is no way to move forward. Additionally; not giving employees a clear path to advance not only discourages them from working hard, but makes it nearly impossible to know or find out how to move forward.
Advice to Management
I know from working in other corporations that neglecting employees is a losing strategy.

Many coworkers I respected had worked under far worse circumstances for less. The jobs are easy to learn and if a person makes numbers, other supposedly important criteria seem quite relaxed.
","Massive turnover, clear management agenda to make jobs cookie-cutter with minimal education or training, drive to automate and cut down workforce--and yet a common reason for eliminating employees is mistakes in elaborate and changing processes while demanding and only rewarding high number output. Nor are employees who excel at that while performing with low error rates singled out for praise or advancement either. In general there are low opportunities for advancement, with arbitrary management that mandates a culture of ""professionalism"" that heavily emphasizes not questioning them, and a very long lag time between identification of major process problems and their eventual solution. They adopted the motto ""Five Years Out"" to complement themselves on their vision and forward-looking, proactive vision, but on the shot floor it seemed more of a statement of how long it would be before problems would be addressed. Everything driven by reaction rather than proactivity. Basically a dead end job and pays accordingly, with experienced and pro-active workforce driven out by low pay and low opportunities for improvement. Shows all the negatives of the legacy companies absorbed early in the decade which were understandable in such small companies, while driving out the committed talent that made those small firms viable and attractive purchases. Nor does top-down management distinguish itself by preparing for process changes they dictate in any way. This is left up to plant management and workers on site. This despite proud boasts by Arrow representatives upon acquisition of these legacy small companies that the large resources and deep pockets of a Fortune 500 company would mean better solutions to operational issues. In fact the supposed infrastructural resources of Arrow might show in a shiny workfloor and buffed walkways for visitors, but never in the machinery, hardware or software, we had to work with. If processes did improve it was from shop floor initiatives that never credited the workers who did them. Proactive vision was never in sight.
Advice to Management
If you lived up to your hype it would be an awesome workplace. Arrow Electronics has the deep pockets workforce to address your problems and you said so to legacy workforces drawn in when you absorbed their companies, but a high investment in proactive, thoughtful process design has never been evident in nearly 4 years I worked under your banner. Nor was diligence and excellence I observed in coworkers rewarded; instead these outstanding workers mostly left to find alternate employment before I did. I left a few behind I care about, but they would probably do best for themselves to get out in time. Only you managers can change this, and it requires courage and honesty on your part.

","Arrow electronics is a disorganize company that feels like a mass conglomeration of several companies that were never uniformly connected. Working here for years you can see the disorganization from middle management downward, individual roles are undefined and at other companies most roles here would be split between individuals instead at Arrow workloads are unattainable. Middle-management is under-qualified in most circumstances. Promotion that occurs from within is not based on performance or education but rather how long someone can survive in the previous role or colleagues made at management level to further promotion.

They have a wonderful line-card (suppliers) and a very strong product and services offering. Given their position in the industry and product offerings, they can appeal to a very large target customer base. When a solid sales team is in place, they can move mountains. Many of the former leaders of this company were the best of the best. They groomed a culture that lasted decades.
","There are virtually little to no traces left of this legacy culture. Most of the employees are either new and disgruntled or more tenured and disgruntled.

Mon Mar 21 2016, Production Technician,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,"Good for a temporary job, bad if you want a career here",10,"This review is based on experience from the OCS/ECS Integration Department in the Phoenix, AZ facility.

* The only way to get fired is to fail to clock-in ON TIME three times. Very difficult to do if you are a punctual person.
* They have 4 different shifts, but sometimes will try to accommodate you with a schedule that you need, but this is for rare cases only.
* Diverse workforce
","* Very poor pay, very few raises if any (Integration Department) As an example, in 5 years doing virtually every job function on the production floor on both sides (OCS and ECS) as well as the warehouse, as well as troubleshooting, I have gotten a whopping $1.50 cent raise since first starting. BTW this isn't even based on performance, everyone gets a similar raise as a whole.
* They claim raises are based on performance, but that's BS.
* They don't hire/promote from within if you are in a lower position (Integration, Warehouse, etc.) I have tried numerous times to apply to different departments/positions, but never even get an interview, and when I follow up, they say they never got my application/resume.
* They don't hire competent workers, and ignore those who actually are and are trying to move up.
* The environment in the OCS department feels like high school and the workers feed into it by acting like teenagers. There seems to be low self-esteem problems.
* Very little communication between pretty much everyone. When there is communication happening, it is very difficult to interpret because they seem to lack basic grammar skills.
* No advancement opportunities if you already work there.
* Management never follows through with what they say and constantly change their minds about virtually everything.
* No tuition reimbursement, again they couldn't care less if you attend college or have certifications. But they are now requiring employees get A+ certified (which I have been since first starting) or they ""demote you."" Getting certified does not result in a raise. (I have many certifications, plus college education, and I am the lowest ""tier"" of their technician positions. I ask why and never receive an answer. Perfect example of management never following through.
* Most integration employees don't even know the basics of computer hardware and have 0 problem solving and critical thinking ability. AND are some of the laziest people I have ever seen, with the exception of a few people I can count on one hand.

Managers speak like politician's. You are expected to know how the manager would handle an account, when management changes their mind daily.

Income smoothing is a normal process. 

Management thrives on double talk and playing the hero to the GMs. They will tell you to delay shipping, knowing that Everything will ship at 5 and if sales calls they will ship the product. The lack of ability to hold a customer accountable has gone far that i have sales reps stating to hold a customer and we ship.

You can have a long and stable career. Coming in you can even get almost market compensation and a benefits package. Once you're in, As a software engineer, I found that if you have no ambition to grow within your field, and don't mind working about four to seven years behind the times, you will be fine and have a long career on cruise control.
","Pay is always below market - unless you're a new hire. Then they don't pay above market, they try to sell you on stability. It's a fear tactic. And honestly, there is no stability. If you kiss up to the right people, the right way, there is some stability. But make no mistake. Arrow does not profit from innovation. They profit from cost cutting. And you are nothing more than a line item on a budget. They would rather hold on to their (as I once heard a manager say) ""Indentured Servants from India"" who they VASTLY underpay and overwork, holding their work visas over their heads, than hold on to you. Even if you show you are highly skilled and prove your work ethic. They'll compliment you. But you will not be rewarded with market value compensation. Your new-hire offer will be the best your compensation does versus market value your entire tenure at Arrow.

As a developer, do not hope to introduce modern ideas anytime soon. Even external customer tools and web technology stacks are decided in favor of ""one platform"" which actually complicates what should be simple and keeps their talent working in technology and methodologies that are years behind. Do not expect to leave Arrow with a lot of market-valuable skills. Expect to find a transitional job where you can get back up to date first. Even contracting positions using the web technology stacks that ECS IT uses pays at about 75% of what the market bears for current web technology rates per hour. A great indicator: In 2010 the corporate standard browser was IE7. Until Microsoft officially ended support for IE7, Arrow refused to change until forced. IE8 was still the corporate standard browser in 2014!!!!! Until 2012, as a WEB developer, I was forbidden to install Firefox or Chrome on my computer without special permission and management from IT helpdesk.

Working in ECS IT is an absolutely morale-killing, career-damaging, innovation-vacuum. Management is in the business of keeping people in line and low-cost. The most talented people I was around were very unhappy but afraid that the economy made job-hopping out of something ""secure"" undoable (this is part of design - a lot of Arrow's message at company townhall meetings is one of Arrow keeping the world employed during tough times). Or they were talented people from India whose work visas held them to Arrow.

Wed Dec 09 2015,N/A,"Englewood, CO","Accountant in Englewood, CO",I have never been as unhappy working for a company as I have been here,15,"Pay is usually above average
Large company so many departments and many places to work
The do cool things
","They hire the worst of the worst for managers. I mean terrible. I have never seen so many unethical things in my career. No one reports it because retatilation is a thing here. A big thing. I've been here for 1.5 years and seen 3 people fired, 2 of which I thought were pretty good employees. No one was ever allowed to leave my department, we were all very miserable adn could not transfer out due to our manager not signing off on us applying to other departments. What sort of system is that??! I was told, word for word, ""If I didn't like you, I'd make up some story and you'd be out the door"". Good encouragement. Never once heard much encouragement, no word meant you were doing ok. Other groups seemed just as unhappy, though I know mine was particularly bad. We were told often we'd all be getting bad reviews, but it really meant nothing b/c when I got a stellar review I did not see any raise or bonus. 

Taking this job made my stress level go through the roof. There was never a good day. My co-workers would talk to me about how this job has made them drink more, be depressed and how they feared for their job often. The work environment was hostile and down right unethical. During close periods we would be in trouble if we took a lunch, as it was expected you did not take any breaks at all during that period. 

I asked for a vacation a year in advance with time off I had saved, and was told no b/c I was never allowed to be absent for more than 2 weeks at a time, even if I had the days (using floating holidays and pto days). That was unacceptable to me b/c I work to live not live to work. It was a year in advance. This should not have been an issue. 

I won't even get into the unethical things I was asked to do as an accountant in my group.
I used to think if I could just get into another group it'd be better, but from what I heard it was just as bad elsewhere. Not to mention, there was no way my manager would ever let me apply outside of my group.

I give a 2 on career opportunities because I was never able to utilize the many opportunities b/c my manager would also say something like, oh you won't like that job, or oh, we still need you so no I can't approve that right now.
Advice to Management
Do something about the hostile environment and HR infractions. Please please implement a review policy for the managers, though I suppose that may not be useful as most of us are afraid of retaliation. I witnessed a manager discussing other people's reviews to myself, (confidential), threats, and other things like it. I even saw a review (from the employee) that was rated low because they did not attend happy hours, which is illegal as ever.

Care for you employees. Bonuses are almost offered everywhere, not having them discourages employees. No raises is also a big no no when the company is still in growth year after year. We would get excited about new benefits supposedly being added, just to see them get cut before they even got a chance to be good (cafeteria, gym, sabbatical leave, more than 2 weeks of vacation can be accrued,etc).

HR is a legal business here, they only serve to control the cattle exactly how management wants them to act and were to focus. If you have a concern about anything do not ever take it to HR, you will get fired if it even remotely smells like negativity.

Fri Jul 24 2015,N/A,"Denver, CO","Technology Product Specialist in Denver, CO",Bring the jobs back home from India!,7,"My commute was short as Arrow was close to home.
","We had a company CEO prior to Mike Long who outsourced lots of jobs to India to a company called ""Infosys"". People in India make a fraction of what workers in the U.S. make and probably don't have health insurance so this saved Arrow lots of money. Therefore, the CEO and the board members got to stuff even more millions of dollars in their pockets as if they weren't making enough money already. This practice is extremely selfish considering the amount of money they make and the fact that all those employees had to find new jobs in a very sluggish economy. To add insult to injury we had to train our Indian replacements! They did give us a bonus for doing so, but that was a pittance compared to what this company was saving. If I were ever faced with that decision again I would get up and walk out. Why should we make it easy for these guys to destroy more jobs in the U.S.?

Our pay plan was changed just about every year to benefit the company. We were paid salary plus commission based on inventory turns and sales or ""turns and earns"". When sales fell off our commission was based heavier on sales thus netting less of an income. They were always messing with our commission portion with no explanation as to why, but everyone knew why.

There were very few women in management and the few who were chosen were less than desirable. It seemed as if the managers had little training in how to deal with people effectively.

Thu Jul 16 2015, Account Manager,,Former Employee ,What happened to this company?,3,"Financially stable company. They are trying to be future oriented, however they are going about it poorly. 3 weeks of vacation to start and moving to 4 weeks is nice.

Medical was good, now fair and if you have family coverage you are better off finding it elsewhere. Tuition assistance, was there now gone. Competition still has it as well as profit sharing.
","Layers on layers of management, ever changing direction. PEMCO oh wait let's get rid of all of those people. Oh we need more feet on the street lets hire a bunch of ADR's. Nope to expensive they have to go as well. Oh wait we need more upper management. Management is the one group they won't get rid of.

Pay and commission plans, no raises after promised in town hall meetings but Arrow buys 2 more companies. Upper management gets raises and more stock options, but the sales people get nothing. If you bring the company $20 million in sales shouldn't you get a commission check? Maybe, but only if you grew your sales 20% year over year when you have 95% share in your accounts.

I forgot, Arrow Electronics is a distributor, there should be stock. Nope orders canceled everyday because you won't stock inventory or it gets sent to another customer because you don't hold parts to lead time.
Advice to Management
Think outside of your own pocket books and look at your employees. Remember without them bringing in the sales you wouldn't have a job. Pay people what they are worth, remember you aren't the only place in town. You see your employees leave for the competition but how often do you get people from them. If you do how long do they stay? You do surveys but nothing seems to come from them, you talk about human resources in notes here. Mine didn't know anything about benefits in the US because she worked in Canada...that's smart! HR doesn't seem to care about the employees either. The good ones have left for better opportunities.

-When close comes around you will not see managers lending a hand but rather gossiping in one of their cubes
-No training, and its your fault you didn't ask for it
-Managers gossip about employees and are not shy about doing so, they'll also talk about employees to their ""favorites""
-Managers seem to have unlimited vacation, even during close. Oddly enough its the end of the world and their job when a staff misses a close day (1 week every month)
-Rule out vacations for 1 week every month and 2 weeks every quarter end! Thats 16 weeks a year you do not DARE miss a day or you better believe you're going to have problems
-You will work late nights closes are generally 10PM and beyond, 1 AM + nights are certainly not unheard of and you must be there before 8AM the next day
-Job was similar to public accounting hours without the perks or career advancement
-Benefits are worthless... Count out retirement because there is a 5 year vesting period and you will not last that long the longest I saw was 3 years (trust me I know how much liability was released every year)
-Do not expect lunches, dinners, or anything extra to be provided by the company. Let me be clear there are no cool perks about working here

","The company is inflexible and pays a low standardized wage to all non-degreed employees. Its benefits are prohibitively expensive and they show no regard for exceptional employees nor make any attempt to retain them where they do not meet a minimum criteria for term of current employment. Management does acknowledge performance and achievement verbally, but is out of touch with the employee needs at the ground level and often makes promises it does not keep or fails to document what it has offered to an employee in the course of his/her employment thus causing a lot of its own problems in supporting and communicating the companies needs to them.

Sat Dec 13 2014, Technician,"Reno, NV",Current Employee ,Stay away,4,,"stently pays their bills. Reliable paycheck so far. Free plastic dining utensils (flatware) and coffee. Decent on-site security for theft prevention. Stand-up video games and web-surfing machines in the break room. We celebrate big achievements with on-site barbecues. Management choices seem to indicate they want to be better.
Cons
Most management (lower, middle, upper) are completely out of touch. A broken organizational chart and a bad living wage begin this review by a leadership professional. A stagnant culture and disrespectful-to-rude interpersonal relations between most management and other employees makes this a scary workplace: culture shock! A lack of leadership among managers has created a lot of disgruntled and unmotivated employees. This is number one of the two most hostile work environments I have experienced in my thirty years in the work force (twelve in the military); when an employee has to run off-site (during a shift) to get away from an unprofessional manager, then leadership is at an extreme low. Little investment in basic support: in three years at this Reno site, the corporation refuses to purchase basic tools, like brooms, to complete the work - employees do not dare ask for more advanced tools (screwdrivers.) Most employees repeat they are simply holding on until the close announcement. Atmosphere looks and feels like a prison or cattle yard with a metal turnstile employee entrance. Worst training ever experienced - I cannot answer myself when I ask how the training could be worse. Although, in fairness, I believe I have a very high standard for training (US Army); most companies fall short on my bar, but this is the nightmare, here. Senior leaders support and even encourage the bad behavior and choices despite suggestions: they know there are problems and want to be better, but do not know how.
Advice to Management
Invest in tools if you expect them to be used (even basic tools like brooms.) Bridge the gap between business management and managing employees; more specifically, get either some managers that have verifiable training and experience in Leadership Management or invest in Leadership Management training for the current managers. Most MBAs have a lengthy bad history from the perspective of Leadership Management: MBAs tend to focus on numbers and managing products / machines, but the MBA manager, and everyone below her/him, will consistently run into problems when trying to 'manage' people with the MBA-learned controls (impossible.) Leadership Management training comes from either extremely experienced managers or specific leader courses from the military. Think about it this way: any of our military branches could be considered a company where the company's product is people and the military company knows best how to 'manage' (lead) the product. I would also suggest: support our nation's military by hiring a trained and proven leader!

Maybe a good place to get your foot in the door in this industry --- but a cheap company with lack of focus on running it like a real company/corporation. At first it seems nice but then you start to experience the issues mentioned in the cons.
","Cheap company: You will not get rich at Arrow. No raise in three years. I knew of at least three people who left the company in order to get a raise (one after 10 years, another 3 years). Only select few get a raise. 
Management : Some good some bad.. Buddy system and lack of training. My mgr was new and was terrible at listening, never took his team's side, and totally missed the boat ... when I was changed to another manager, he was great. The company also is not ran like a typical corporation. They have no support, no administrative support -- managers have a lot on them. Some try to help you and support you, but it's not good overall.
Training: Tthere is no central training or person -- and just poorl training all around. I was trained by another new employee who had been there 2 weeks! When I moved to a new area -- I had to lean on my co-workers to learn my new job. They were busy and didn't really have the time, but that is just the way it's done there. This goes for management as well. Really lacking! 
Commission Structure: They changed it ... If you meet your quota (which is all relative to your mgr and accounts - not really based on how hard you work).... by quarters. If you meet it and get paid the first month, and again in the second month - but fail to meet it at end of qtr (3rd month) -- you have to pay it all back to the company. Yikes! A veteran employee ended up having to do this -- and he said in all the years he had been there they had never had it set up this way.
HR: Lack of HR presence --- do not support or push advancement. No jobs are posted internally, and moved up if you know the right person. Closely involved with upper mgr, managers --- not so not going to be on your side.
Advice to Management
Pay your people. You have hired good, talented people -- really this is the one shining spot about Arrow -- but you don't pay them... and keep wanting them to do more and take more away. Restructure -- corporate policies and central training/person at each location. Focus on solutions versus blaming .... and when an issue arises internally in the office -- managers should not assume but welcome all sides to the table to discuss and resolve.

And they life to refer to the utter chaos as a fast pace environment... I will not recommend this company to anyone I care about because there is nothing called work-life balance in Arrow...

Having said that, if your main concern is a paycheck, Arrow's compensation and benefits are surprisingly good for a company with declining margins. If you live in south Denver, the location is great. I'd also have to say that first line management is fairly strong and employee oriented. Its upper management that is disconnected.

If you're looking to finish out a working career with decent pay - Arrow may work for you. If you're a young person looking for a career - look else where.

The focus is always on the business statistics that control our stock valuation and cash-flow. In combination with Arrow’s compensation methodologies (ex. 70/30 base/incentive split salary) the individual employee is able to, with just a modicum of business acumen, directly affect their compensation and performance appraisals.
 This culture also, perhaps counter-intuitively, allows for certain freedoms an individual may not experience in another industry or even a direct competitor. One small example: As long as an employee is meeting and exceeding the business goals set for them their superior will, on average, allow a great deal of leeway regarding work times, punctuality, appointments and etcetera.
","Arrow’s focus on business statistics can also be the corporation’s biggest con as well. Hard numbers don’t, usually, reward the ‘innovator’ employee.

Ironically, those are the types of employees that will help Arrow reach the goal of clear market leader most quickly and efficiently.

","Ask any Arrow management type and they always harp on the fact that their strength is ""their people"". Yet, these are the same people they treat with flagrant disregard. ""Their people"" are overworked and underappreciated. Arrow has forgotten the rules of providing good customer service (which strangely enough was the driving force to some of their acquisitions). As a result, partners have noticed and are starting to leave in bunches. Guess what – that will be one more excuse for Arrow to downsize. Mike Long may eventually turn the company around (though I don’t know the man from the stapler that used to sit on my desk) but until they show signs of removing their heads from the sand I would not recommend anyone start a career there.
Advice to Management
Wake up - try and right the ship while you still have some good experienced folks to assist. Otherwise your talent will find positions elsewhere and Arrow will be left with the temps and short timers that they have come to rely on for their day to day work. Customers can tell who knows their stuff and who does not - trying to fool them with inexperienced workers is a recipe for disaster.

Also – you might want to try rethinking your customer service model. Sinking 150 million into a failed SAP project and then ramming it down everyone’s throat is a sure sign that management is out of touch with their workers and their customers.

Overall it has done an excellent job cutting operating expenses and establishing practices to minimize loss and RIFs during the recession. The division I work for is financially profitable although sales are down year to year. 

Culture is not a ""work overtime or else"" --a 9 hour day is accepted and practiced. Pay is competitive. Older and youthful employees are valued. Somewhat diverse, but almost no cultural diversity. The office I work in is a fairly laid back place to work, with a New England aggression/superiority overlay. It's a cliquish but not malicious group. Management is pretty honest, earnest, and means well.
","(Preface -- much personal dissatisfaction comes more from the dissonance between my personal goals/ values and current job, rather than Arrow itself). 

Extremely difficult to develop or advance. If you are okay with staying in place, Arrow is a good, stable place to work. Personal Development plans are pure pro forma. Arrow University is a joke. Online development tools are not explained or used well. Management measures performance metrics by how your peers perceive you, so ERP is a bit of a popularity contest. If you're capable but not popular you get low marks. 

How well you do in a customer satisfaction crisis counts, which often means that customers must become dissatisfied before your performance can be appreciated. Sor the bar ends up staying fairly low. Other than that there are no formal performance monitoring metrics. Tuition assistance and sabbaticals have been suspended. 

The division I work for was originally high touch. It has flattened out and dumbed down over the years. Sales emphasis is low, order accuracy and service levels are high. Lots of focus around workarounds to existing processes that don't work so well, so there are lots of complex trees branching out from somewhat dysfunctional processes. Teams work around processes or execute real time customer product/inventory inquiries. You feed the job in the limited capacity it requires, the job doesn't feed you nor does it require any creative energy. For a right brainer, It can be an energy drain with few moments of inspiration. 

Not a lot of strategic or visionary thinking/planning at the staff/group level. When it happens at management level it doesn't get communicated very well if at all. Communication from the top down and laterally has been and continues to be broken with a lot of lip service given to fixing it. Tasks are repetitive. I hear the frustration all around me and it can bleed out to customers.
Advice to Management
When you say that staff is the strongest resource and do nothing to help us maintain our strength and passion, it's just lip service. Say it and commit to feeding that resource. People need to be passionate about something other than a good salary to bring them to work every day. Passion, determiniation and excitement rather than frustration and no can do is what customers like. 

Make divisions less silo'd. Establish some P&L measurement connection between different groups that both face the customer. Regarding Bill Mitchell approval below, as of May 1st, 2009 he is no longer CEO. Mike Long took over the position. Mitchell did an excellent job, one exception being Lean 6 Sigma - it wasn't a strong imprint (weak rollout) - as a result the natives who were supposed to be converted are still practicing the Voodoo.

There is no real structure in the way of career advancement (From what I've seen, if you're a minority you have very, very little chance of moving up), and management simply doesn't care about the work/life balance (Overtime is not simply suggested, it's required - especially at quarter/year end). A good percentage of management are unqualified for the positions they hold, and some of them have less education than the people they are manage. The best employees eventually get tired of this and end up going to other companies (including our competitors). And because of the downturn, we've recently lost a lot of people, which makes it that much harder for everyone around the office to do their job.

Thu Jun 04 2020,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,create your own story,0,"I read employer reviews and was sceptical at first but it has been one of the most developmental experiences in my career. Take the ratings with a pinch of salt. Your Arrow experience will depend on many things - your manager, your role, the challenges that come with both and opportunities to make the most of it.
","It's a place that will challenge you lots and outside of your comfort zone. Be ready to be uncomfortable and be daring. Own what you do and how you do it and it will work out ok.
Advice to Management
Communicate more and better. Problem solve. Stay focused on priorities, if you try to do everything at the same time, you focus on nothing

Thu Mar 26 2020,Anonymous,Sydney,Current Employee ,"Awesome company to work for, great people and place to gain a solid experience.",0,"You can learn a lot about the entire industry in pretty short time.
There is no micromanagement, the moment you pick up the knowledge you are free to execute on your ideas and responsibilities, supported by colleges, senior reps/managers if needed. People are supportive, hard working and fun in the same time which makes you want to be a part of the team. If you are keen to grow and learn more they will support you. People who perform well are really appreciated. Flexibility on working from home here and there when needed.
","Workload is sometimes a bit heavy but that probably applies everywhere these days.

Wed Apr 15 2020, Support Job Profile,Pune,Former Employee ,Good for those who want to retire in same company. Safe Job. Good pay (Best in industry),3,"1. Good handsome salary, yearly bonus and much more.
2. Safe job, no one will lay you off ever.
3.If you are fortunate enough to get good reporting manager then life is perfect here.
","1. No carrier advancement at all. No growth in terms of knowledge & promotions. Nothing new to learn here, no new training's given. Here people many work at same designations & do same tasks daily literally 6 years or may be even more. But happy because they get handsome salary & safe job.
2.Unfortunately if your reporting manager is not good then you have to slog like slaves because anyways here performance dosent matter you are given chances to improve but company will never lay you off until you resign.
So your manager is god. 
3.Have experienced - Reporting manager was making his reportees feel and make sure there is no ""NO"" word in your dictionary. if person says NO to voluntary/not compulsory work on Weekly offs he will not pay you yearly bonus for sure & lowest rating he could give (irrespective of your hard work). Its only because managers ""ego"" was hurted. 
4.Have experienced - Unfortunately the same reporting manager will say NO to you to go home from work even though you get urgent medical emergency call from your family and when your family really needs you. It happened once in my tenure where in i always had clean leave record & good work record.
5.If clarification asked to your HR spoke regarding HR policies, they will not reply to you directly but in turn will check with your manager and the clarification/policies are directed by manager and not HR.
