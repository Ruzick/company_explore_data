Create and enforce a clear and specific anti-bullying policy, and offer related training programs at all levels. Take complaints about workplace bullying seriously, even when they fall outside the narrow definition of harassment or discrimination.

The company undermines its own values by enabling conduct that creates a toxic work environment. By ignoring this issue, the company robs itself of the great work employees can contribute in an environment where they feel valued and respected, and robs employees of their mental and physical wellbeing. There is a wealth of information available on this topic, which I hope Dollar Tree will consider and incorporate into their efforts to ""invest in their people.""

","Low costs of running the store(1 manager, 1 crew member only per shift) meant we were constantly understaffed and unable to get anything on the shelves. Which means that store managers end up overworked and underpaid for the efforts they put in everyday.
Advice to Management
Low costs aren't even important if there are not any store managers willing to come in. Isnt it better to keep the managers you have happy, rather than continuously train new ones because you are unwilling to allow more hours for the stores that need that extra person to help stock shelves? Stress is a serious health issue as well as depression due to the pandemic and the work on top of it, store managers should be recognized for what they have had to do with the last year!

Actually compensate for hours worked in excess of 48 hours a week since we're required to fill every position whenever there's a 'call off' and other staff cannot 
Provide training hours in the weekly budget so that store managers can have group meetings with staff for education and informational purposes
Listen to managers when we convey we're being overloaded with certain merchandise and lacking in others
Revamp distribution center system - modernize methods to reduce employee injury and improve speed of products to floor. Ex: use pallet methods; deliver only when stores are closed; move to 100% off hour stocking; penalize drivers and companies for late, delayed, lost deliveries.
Stop filtering everything through district managers - regional staff should visit stores monthly to meet with staff -not just once a year for critical inspections - more presence.

","From my personal experience, they were against
me because I had acrylic nails and this one manager who seemed to have a problem with me since day one came to the conclusion that my nails were slowing me down even though I kept
trying to tell them It’s not the nails, it’s me being new to the register and not knowing how to count money faster. The managers then told me to go shorter with the nails, which I did. They still had a problem with them. If they truly had a problem with my nails, which they clearly saw the day they interviewed me, they could’ve said something right then and there or could not have hired me. But they still hired me and blamed everything I did on my nails which made no sense and made me uncomfortable. They wasted my time. I just constantly felt like I was being interrogated at work although I tried my hardest and it was my first job as a cashier.

Mon Dec 28 2020, Assistant Manager,,Current Employee ,"Pay issues, corporate lack of interest",0,"Hours are guaranteed for full time staff or management. 
Cashiers are probably some of the best people I've ever met, some staff members are delightful and beyond patient and smart.
Great way to build up customer experience with the flow of people and issues they present on a daily basis, you learn to handle even the most difficult situations with ease. 
Great way to find good things for cheap, most products are in and out of the door in a day because of the deals they get for them. Full sized products and all.
","I literally have worked fourteen days in a row without a day off and other staff continue to taunt you if you complain about needing a day off to get rest. No one will pick up hours to cover other shifts and if you're management, you're pretty much stuck doing everything. 
Two out of four managers actually do their job, and I have to do the job of three just to keep up and get actual panic attacks from the fear of having no staff, no time, and too much to do. 
Because of the amount of people not doing their job, it falls back on two of us and the atmosphere becomes absolutely toxic. At any point you get complaints and lectures for not completing the job in time and not finishing others. 
Corporate's response to anything is to get district managers to yell at their staff for outdated equipment, short staffing, and lack of sales. 
The pay alone is a joke. Cashiers aren't even paid a livable wage and management staff are paid almost five dollars more and threatened to lose their job/pay if they tell staff. 
Yearly reviews are conducted and used more as a joke than anything. I got a 5/5 and my coworker got 2/5 and we got the same raise. Which was fifteen cents. 
Recently discovered everyone is getting bonuses while I haven't received any in the two years I've worked there. 
There is a woman on staff who frequently verbally abuses customers and staff regularly to the point of complaints from customers and staff including people quitting and corporate's response was to say that she was too old and it would become an age thing due to her being into retirement age. 
And lastly, their covid response is a joke.

","Poor training. Management team overworked. They expect you to be available at all times everyday. As a manager, you are in charge of not just doing your own tasks but the tasks of regular employees as well because they are always understaffed. Store managers worked around 60 hours a week and were still expected to answer the phone and come when needed. The trucks were inconsistent and communication was weak, causing workload to triple for consecutive weeks. Upper management did not care about employees and would constantly threaten to fire if demands were not met. Stores were extremely busy and we were supposed to somehow manage with only 1 to 2 employees on staff at all times.

Overall, I feel as if this company can improve on a lot. I think it is important to start by taking care of your store management and listen to concerns and suggestions. It is impossible to expect for a store to be fully recovered the next day when you are closing with a single employee, therefore hiring more employees per store would be extremely beneficial.

","In general, prepare to ALWAYS be grossly understaffed and overworked. The hiring department is beyond incompetent as both the store managers and lower managers continue to show that they are unaware of how to do their jobs properly. The lack of security in the store and outside of the store is abysmal as customers and employees are free to constantly steal merchandise and cash from the store. The equipment outdated and has either been broken for months/years or is on the verge of breaking. The location I worked at had 6 cash registers. Out of the 6, only 3 worked and out of those 3, only 2 worked more than 50% of the time. The company does NOT care about the lower level employees & offers little to no benefits. The hours are scarce and fought over. Depending on the location, the pay can be the most egregious part in all of this. You'll start off at a wage which is usually minimum or only slightly above and raises don't occur too often.

The work is strenuous, but the tasks are routinely done. You ALWAYS work with a manager, so do not fear to ask for assistance. If you want an additional stream of income at minimum wage, this is an ideal part time position.
","When the store is low on employees, prepare yourself for last-minute call-ins, more responsibilities, and longer shifts. A customer representative has multiple roles, and it is rotational (not by choice but by the store's needs). You are a cashier, a janitor, a stocker, and a trainer for new employees. It is a fast pace work environment, and you WILL make mistakes (which is okay). Sometimes, you have to work the cash register by yourself, while your other coworkers are preoccupied with other tasks (even during busy days). Every coworker is not team-oriented, and every manager is not either. The atmosphere is not professional, but it is profitable.

Tue Oct 27 2020, Merchandise Manager,,Current Employee ,Not worth it,0,"- They like to promote from the inside got promoted from cashier to ops manager to merch manager
- If you're a cashier its an easy job that can pay alright if you can get the hours
","- Company has gone downhill a lot in the recent years. Feels like every year is worse than the last. 
- There is a serious disconnect between the stores and corporate. 
- The amount of freight they send you on a weekly basis is absurd and no this isn't just cause its the holiday season. It could be April and the freight you'd get in would be ridiculous for a weekly shipment. 
- OSHA loves this company for all their constant violations which the company ignores the actual problem which is their awful corporate management and freight practices. 
- Healthcare plan is not great, wouldn't even call it good. Had someone who worked in the medical field look at it and they were shocked at how poor it actually was. 
- Be ready to have no hours to get anything done and the company constantly adding more to be done without giving you the hours or help to get it done
- District Managers can be completely useless and offer no support to stores and will often ignore stores. 
- The pay is awful. For being a full time worker and the expectations the company has and to be making $2 more than a cashier is shameful and defeating. 
- Constant stress and defeating feeling because of the weekly freight that you never make progress on. You have no time to get anything done, as a manager you're solely responsible for getting stuff packed out as our store doesn't have just stockers but you also have to manage the front and be the backup cashier which happens A LOT because the stores are so busy which leads you to not being able to get anything out.
- Company expectations are completely misaligned with reality. They expect loads of people to apply and push dumb memos saying you could have 80 applications a day and you'd be lucky if you get 1 a week among other dumb stuff they try and shove on us. 
- Bonus's can be near impossible to achieve because you have no hours to stock the shelves so you have no product on the shelves to sell.
- Doesn't like to spend money on payroll. This is one of the biggest things to me they want to make money(obviously) and they over send on everything yet they give stores no hours to put it out so its money sitting in the back. Then you over send freight again so you get backed up to a staggering amount. If they actually gave stores support to get the stuff out everyone wins. Company makes more money, the employees make more since its based on the volume of the store, your managers are happy to make more and to have the help and stockroom cleaned out. The cost of giving someone hours and the freight they'd get out way over exceeds how much it would cost to employ them.
- Company doesn't like to do anything about people not pulling their own weight. They would rather you work around someone then actually get rid of them and help get someone new in.

If they limit the DC deliveries to just twice a month it’ll give your stores more time to put out the stock.

Specific stores and/or employees are negitivly pointed out to the entire district and/or region. You are told to fix something, but given little to no advice on how to do so. Recently they took advantage of Florida State law as being a ""right to work"" state, or more properly a right to fire state. I was hired as a full-time assistant store manager given incorrect information about the process of promotion. During this crisis they have decided two things: 1, internal promotions have been suspended while they have implemented a massive external hiring campaign giving management positions to external hires, 2, related to the first in the state of Florida they have demoted every single full-time ""ASM"" assistant to part time while hiring other to fulfill the required work to be done.

","This job is not a job you should look into applying for. There is never NO HOURS and the management is not trying to give anyone any hours. They always take the hours for themselves. The schedules are no made 3 weeks in advance like all other jobs. The schedules are made weekly and when you do get one, they always revise it and deduct hours from the stockers. The only time this company does care about their employee's is when their freight truck ccomes but as soon as that truck is unloaded, they tell you immediately to clock out. and give you at least one day during the week to stock which is like 4 hours 5 the max. If you have a family, car expenses, rent, or any form of responsibilities, Dollar tree is not a good CAREER Choice. Its filled with false hopes, promises and its designed to keep you broke!

There's also hours available for cashiers and assistant managers during the day. They will work around your schedule to get you your hours. Great starter position or addition to add to the side of your regular job. Currently, they have more need for workers than they used to. If you keep busy stocking, cleaning up the store, filling the balloon coral, putting things away in their correct places, being kind to customers, you will be an asset they will want to hold onto.
","On your feet all day long. Very routine, can get boring. Tend to want to buy something each day you work there, unless you're very good about not spending your money. They don't seem to give pay raises very soon unless you move up to management.
Advice to Management
To get more employees and keep the employees you like around, you should give more incentive to stay, like regular pay raises for good performance, since inflation is only going up for everyone. Also, realize you have too few workers, so don't expect more than what can be done in a shift or at least try to understand that not everything can get done. Focus on what is getting done instead of what's not. Employees are working hard (maybe not all) but some are and try to appreciate those who are trying hard and getting things done.

Expected to work longer than scheduled and not be asked about it.
You will get in trouble/wrote up for not clocking out on time and expected to work off the clock because you have other stuff to do but not given time to do it.
Advice to Management
Stop trying to make cashiers work off the clock or get wrote up because the employee can not count the til, re-shop, clean bathrooms, sweep, and take the trash out because the company is to cheap to hire more workers. $7.25 is a joke wage and you know it. The company overworks the managers/assistant managers again because the company is to lazy and cheap to hire more workers. Stop writing people up for not being able to do what they need to do because there is no one to cover the registers. You get what you pay for. The higher ups are extremely rude and dismissive. I was there for a year (only because I liked my manager) and ,along with the others, we were treated very poorly by them. The company needs more hours for the employees to make the stores look acceptable. They all look terrible at the moment around here. I understand everything is a dollar but treating employees badly isn't in your best interest. You may want to look at some of your district and regional managers, they are not giving the stores enough hours. Unfortunately it shows in all the stores. ( They are trashed).

","Poor leadership and lack of training.
Advice to Management
The success of any organization are the employees doing the daily tasks. In this case, the cashiers, sales associates, the stockroom clerks, just to name a few. When those workers are treated poorly, the organization suffers.

Lack of Leadership Skills
Lack of leadership leads to high attrition. The leadership at the Ritchie Station Marketplace, Capitol Heights, Maryland location should attend customer service training. It is unacceptable to communicate to the staff and customers in the way they do. Leaders are held to a different standard. Respect is earned. Get to know your employees. You will be surprised what you can learn! 

Lack of Training
Lack of training sets the staff up for failure. A new employee should not be left to “figure things out” on their own. A new employee should be assigned someone to train them prior to having them function a cash register. Not operate a register on their first day on the job, by themselves. The organization has set the employee up for failure; as well as the organization. Holding an employee accountable should something go wrong becomes difficult to justify when multiple employees can log on to any register. When an employee counts and signs for a drawer at the start of their shift, no other employee should have access to that register. Counting the drawers regularly throughout one’s shift should occur. Not just at the end of the shift. 

Store Appearance
The name “Dollar Tree” speaks for itself. The appearance of the store should not reflect its name. Customers should not have to move boxes out of their way to find items. The volume of products sold by Dollar Tree stores will generate many customers. Consider having employees who stock and clean the store after closing; an overnight shift. There are many people who would consider working those types of shifts. 

Corporate Visits
What’s the benefit of having a corporate staff visit a location, stand in line to purchase items, them report to the manager if the visit was not pleasant? In stores such as Dollar Tree, there are long lines and customers complaining. Honestly, corporate already know what the issues are. Corporate visits should include meeting and speaking with the staff. Not just critique them in a poor manner. Managers are not the only employees of the organization.

An organization such as Dollar Tree may not be a permanent career for many people. It is an organization that offers employment to many in need of a job; young, middle aged and those who have already had a career. People will always remember the way they are treated. The experience with this organization is one that has left a lasting impression; not in a good way.

Sun Sep 29 2019, Store Associate,,Current Employee ,It's a job,12,"Reliable company to work for. Dollar Tree is doing well as a company and currently opening a lot of new stores. 
Bi-weekly paychecks 
If you're full time you get offered insurance which you have good options from the provider. Not just one plan or price range but different options to consider. 
Store Management doesn't have to take time to forecast sales. 
Everything is $1 so price checks are super easy! 
Almost every section is the store is a flow and not planogrammed so stocking is somewhat easier. 
You get emails so many days before your next truck with what's coming in item by item broken down by department and a sheet of how many cases for each department is coming in and how many hours it should take to process each department if you're meeting the cases per hour. 
401K with 4% company match (I think all associates qualify for this after so many months with the company).
Flexible schedule for non-management associates
There's a company rule that a manager cannot work alone. Has to be at least one other associate. I know of similar retailers that do not have that rule. 
Room for advancement. I've seen regular associate become an assistant manager and assistant managers become store managers. Sometimes store managers become district managers and district managers to the next level.
","It's obvious the company doesn't trust it's associates. If you're buying something the day you are work (on your break or if you're ""shopping on the clock"" (which isn't technically allowed) a manager is supposed to ring you up and you are supposed to do an employee sale. If that isn't bad enough, technically each item is supposed to be rung individually. 
THE PAY!!! Typically non-management associates are paid whatever their state's minimum wage is plus a little (ten cents) but if you're in a bad area you might make a little more. When hired the store manager can try to get you more but you might have a Regional HR Person who doesn't budge over a certain amount. 
There is a lot expected of each associate (cashiers are supposed to put stuff together, stockers have to meet case counts, etc). You could get a job somewhere else making more money and less physical labor. Plus they give you one 15 cents raise a year (20 cents if you're an ASM) once a year and act they're paying a lot. 
No control over your warehouse truck. They allow you to order some things but not much. If there's something you see it will let you order and you want to cut back the amount the company is trying to send you cannot cut it back. 

In addition to no control over your trucks you often get more of what you don't need (bleach) and not enough of what you actually need and often times you don't get enough of a replenished item to pack up your shelves. 
Not enough help or not enough really good employees because the pay sucks. However many hours the store gets that's for anything that is done on the clock from cashiering to assistant managers. Each employee has computer training that is required when they're hired. The amount of time it takes to complete is based on their position. Managers have at least two hours worth while cashiers have at least close to an hour. It's important and not terribly corny but you get no payroll just for training. Same goes for truck. If you have a slow driver and it takes four hours to unload that's four hours times the amount of hourly associates less you have elsewhere to stock. 
Ideally the company only wants hourly associates (except for management) working 15 hours a week. If a stocker was helping unload the 4 hour long truck that only give them 11 hours left then subtract the required ten minute breaks for each 4 - 5 hour shift that leaves 10 1/2 hours of stocking. With the pay rate of the company you don't get many stockers who can meet the case counts and help make a noticeable difference in the stock room in 10 1/2 hours of stocking. 
In addition, the trucks are unloaded piece by piece which takes a while to unload plus not every store has a dock or ability to put down a dock plate. 
Cheapskate security measures for high theft items. Granted everything is dollar or less but associates and managers see the same things stolen each week. 
Inventory management is a joke. It's pretty common to either have a mispick/mislabeled items or items sent to the wrong store. You're lucky if it was for your store. I was in a store and on two different occasions had merchandise for three or four different stores in addition to what I was supposed to receive. Truck drivers can't take anything back so you get stuck with it. 
Here's where inventory really becomes a joke: frozen/dairy is the only thing you can change a balance without going through the process of what's called a cycle count. Everything else you have to request a cycle count, put the numbers in to the computer when the count comes down then a few days later the balance changes. Even then it doesn't seem to do any good. 
If you didn't get your mislabeled/mispicked items to the shelf or balance changed before inventory the inventory crew will scan the carton labels when counting the stock room so the bad balance will stay. 
No real incentive for non-management associates to stay. They don't get offered insurance and don't get vacation time. Unless they really like working there or have a certain schedule they don't want to give up they wouldn't be losing much of anything if they left even after quite a few years in. 
No word processor in the stores. The company doesn't like hand written signs but they don't give you even the most basic included with Windows word processor. 
Find or create a program so associates can view their schedule online. You've made other things available online now add schedules to it. 
Sometimes hard to get certain supplies you need or the right amount you need. 
The pegs for the peg boards and slat walls aren't strong enough to hold the gift bags and table cloths in the party section. If you load too many on a peg or a customer pulls too hard the peg back breaks. Sometimes it breaks a piece of the wall. Then you have to pick up the product and get a new peg. 
Not enough company wide communication on certain things. If a popular product like cat litter is out of stock in certain D.C.'s or not going to be carried you need to communicate to the stores so they can tell a customer when asked. 
Snack Zone is a huge con. From the customer's perspective it's a cool idea and great variety. From the associate perspective, it's a big pain to maintain and there are no extra hours for it after your first few weeks of having it. 
Registers and software seems out of date. 
Cashiers are limited to what they can do. I know of grocery store cashiers that can do more on their numbers that in Dollar Tree only managers can do. 
Markdowns are a joke. Mark through the barcode and use a price gun to price the front after reducing it in the machine. Just get a markdown program on the machine, a printer and labels for each store and allow each marked down item to scan at a reduced price so the inventory on the item stays more accurate.
Advice to Management
First and foremost: bump up the pay!! I'm not saying $15/hour but even fast food restaurants pay more. You act like you're the Taj Mahal of discount retail stores but your pay sucks. Even store and assistant managers aren't properly paid for the headache they deal with. Stop opening up new stores and pay your employees fairly and pay them for their experience. Also, increase the amount of a raise you give and give it twice a year. The pay is so little and raises are low too how do you thing associates feel. Minimum wage = mostly minimum wage work ethics. People get hired and don't come to do their paperwork or get hired, do the paperwork then never show up or show up a few times then quit without notice. 
It's nice that you don't expect a store manager to sit down and order their whole truck but allow for adjustments. Allow for the stores to cut back on things they don't need a ton of like Ramen Noodles. 
If you put a Snack Zone in a store you need additional hours every week for it to be properly maintained not just in the beginning. 
Send the supplies stores and their DM order and don't make it so they have to reorder week after week until they finally get it. 
Add in hours for unloading the trucks and training and somehow don't make it count towards the entire store payroll or cut the trucks back and lessen computer training without giving up the lessons it teaches in the training. 
Get the stores a word processor and/or a sign making program so there won't be tacky hand written notes in a store. 
Improve the inventory system. If you can make it so a frozen food balance can be changed almost any time then you can make the rest of the store the same way. 
Have more trust in your associates. Not everyone is going to steal from you. Most people are pretty honest and just want to be fairly compensated.

","There are a lot of cons. 

The amount of freight that comes into the store is on a completely different level than you have ever experienced guaranteed. They will tell you its a lot stocking, but you will underestimate how much that is. It's completely common for boxes to be everywhere. Thousands of boxes piled on top of eachother in box mountains. Boxes on uboats on the sales floor. Seriously. Walk into a couple dollar trees nearby before you make a decision to get an idea of what I am talking about. 

Dollar tree orders automatically based on what they buy, upcoming ads and such. It's normal to receive thousands of an item you cannot even merchandise yet but have to find a spot to put it in. 

Dollar tree believes in having 4x the amount of product as sales for each item. For example. If you sell 30-50 snickers bars a week, you will receive 200 snickers bars nearly everyday. You have to find a place to merchandise these extra bars. 

Dollar tree burns through people faster than any company I've ever seen. It's normal to hire someone for a position, and get a day out of them before you hiring another person for the same position. 

Its very difficult to manage a dollar tree store. You're expected to have your freight completely out but its nearly impossible even at fully staffed. Combined with the walmart level of people that come through the door, you will end up being a cashier most of the day. 

6 and 7 work days are expected by your supervisors if your store isn't perfect. Sunday is the only day you're generally allowed to take off but thats not a given. 

Shifts are 7am to 5pm 5 days a week and 12 to close time once a week. It's very normal to work passed 5pm. 

Since dollar trees burn through people, you will most likely take over a store that is months behind across multiple Categories and be expected to right the ship pretty much immediately. The freight never stops. So what ends up happening is the store manager works 7 days a week till they burnout and quit and the process repeats itself. 

The company pushes having a clean sales floor thats recovered/zoned, freight put out, and no long lines with good customer service, but pays most employees minimum wage and gives just enough hours to cover 1 cashier from open to close.
Advice to Management
With 40-50% profit margins on each store and the very real possibility of increasing sales by having process actually completed there is no reason why labor hours aren't much more than they are. Doubled even. 

This would be the equivalent of a walmart running on a 10 people. 

Freight and recovery can only happen if you have employees that arent turning over and hours to give them to finish these tasks. These 2 things will lead to much more sales which more than pays for the increased labor.

Fri Oct 11 2019, Store Manager,"Denver, CO",Current Employee ,Not for everyone...,2,"Fast Paced retail... there is very little idle time! The store is fun and is a great niche business in today's volatile retail industry. As Store Manager you are truly running the show each day. There is a monthly bonus program allowing for increases to your paycheck (and your ASM's) if your store reaches revenue goals - - 3 levels of bonus each month (threshold, target and max).
","Work/Life balance is not good... expect to work 60 hours per week in order to succeed at your job (minimum requirement is 45 per week).
6 days per week are required during the holiday season... typical for retail management.
Benefits for salaried store managers is HORRENDOUS... a salaried store manager receives ZERO sick days per year (I had surgery recently and did not have any PTO days remaining (as the company only gave me 3 whopping days for the year) and since the company provides ZERO sick days I had to go back to work 2 days after surgery to the dismay of my doctor - - I have never in my years of working in management seen a company that did not offer any sick time... until Dollar Tree.
The company also offers ZERO paid holidays for its salaried store managers... we are ""allowed"" to take Christmas off (as we are closed) but need to take it off as one of our normal days off for the week... other than that NO PAID HOLIDAYS.
I was hired at the start of the 4th quarter last year so was given a lousy 3 days of PTO to use during FY2019 - February '19 through January '20. I will get a whopping 1 week of vacation time this next year - - - horrible horrible work/life balance.
The other BIG con has to do with FREIGHT and logistics... the distribution centers are horribly inconsistent with freight deliveries and the delivery window can change multiple times each week... this makes it extremely difficult to manage labor at the store level not to mention the fact that employee morale erodes as you continually change work schedules to coincide with changing truck deliveries.
Advice to Management

Take more pride in pleasing the customers, keep the stores in better/cleaner condition. Better call center-they put you on hold for eternity, and never end up answering the phone at all. Re-invest some of the 300 billion a year profit into serving the customer better.

Mon Sep 02 2019, Store Manager,,Current Employee ,The worst company I have ever worked for.,4,"Easy to get promoted because nobody wants to work here.
","Low pay for all. Assistant Manager's pay is embarassing. Store Managers don't make enough. Associates make minimum wage and don't get regular raises.
Low PTO. I've had one week off as a Store Manager in a year.
Minimum 48 hour work week for Store Managers, you'll usually work 60+. There are days I've worked 5 AM to 10 PM. I have worked 90 hour weeks.
Skeleton crew. As a Store Manager, you'll cashier and stock for 90% of your day because you only have enough hours to have one cashier. Customers get angry all day because there are not enough cashiers and the shelves are empty. Nothing we can do because corporate doesn't give enough hours. Even if they gave enough hours, there aren't enough people willing to work for this company because of the terrible pay and working conditions. 
Run-down stores. My store has no A/C, registers that break daily, only one working store phone, dial-up internet speeds, disgusting old bathrooms that are falling apart, a disgusting ""break area"" that consists of one table and two chairs, which we use to store boxes on because they overfill our backroom with products.
The backroom is OVERFILLED with stock due to a weekly truck, not enough stockers and no hours to stock, and no way to ever catch up on anything. It is extremely stressful and kills morale. The company doesn't care because a store has to be at $25 per square foot. If you work in a large store, you will never have a manageable backroom. 
The company piles on more paperwork, new rules, more work, more expectations weekly, with absolutely zero support.

There are so many more cons but I can't possibly list them all. DON'T WORK HERE!!!
