Schedules are very flexible generally 8-5 and maybe an 11-8 to work dinner. 
Can always continue to grow into a supervisor role etc.
Fun if you like to be in a busy environment.
","Working more than 45 hours a week as salaried due to issues at store. 
Checking up on store after work hours constantly. 
Job gets very redundant
Training is usually lackluster so you're better off teaching yourself.
