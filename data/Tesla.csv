Thu Apr 27 2017, White Collar Worker In Service (Headquarters),"Fremont, CA",Current Employee ,"A unique company, but it’s hard to last more than a couple of years here.",825,"Completely casual dress code

Flexibility to work from home when needed

Always interesting to work at the factory

If you look at the SEC filings, you can see that the top people are basically compensated the same as the other employees, which is a pleasant surprise.

Many “beautiful people” here (male and female). Lots of eye candy.

A lot of people complain about the pay, but they paid me more than my last company, where I had the same title

LGBT friendly

The product is cool, and really fun to drive

If you’re in the right department, you might be able to drive a Tesla somewhat regularly. If not, there is an ongoing contest where you can be randomly selected to take one home for a couple of nights

The company is still growing

There is room to move geographically within Service, since Tesla owns the Service Centers

Lots of “car guy” coworkers to keep conversations interesting

Benefits actually got better and cheaper every year from 2012-2015, and stayed similar after that. I guess this was due to the company growing and getting better group rates. Regardless, not many people can say that.

You’ll frequently come to work that day expecting to work on a certain project and end up on something totally different. This can be good and bad.

Starting hours are typically flexible, which is a really nice perk. Nobody is making sure you’re in your seat at a certain time.

Most employees are surprisingly responsive and friendly.

Very heavy email-based communication, and it mostly works quite well.

You get good at doing the best you can with the resources you have, rather than doing the best possible job. This isn’t necessarily a complaint, since it’s a valuable skill to have, but you should consider if you’re going to be okay in that kind of environment before applying.
","Rare to be recognized, let alone thanked, for going above and beyond to accomplish something out of the ordinary. Once you've ""done the impossible"", it's just assumed that you can and will do it again and again from now on. 

Literally hundreds of people in one room, desks on top of each other, as many as possible in every little space. Companies claim that they’re being “modern” and “progressive” by not having offices and cubicles, but they’re just being cheap. Look at pictures of offices from the 1950’s. You’ll see the same hundreds of desks in a room.

Yearly raises are typically less than the cost of living

Work/life balance is mediocre at best

Smallish yearly bonuses in the form of golden handcuffs. RSUs that vest over 4 years, so you’ll wait a long time to benefit from them

Those who were hired before mid-2013 made a lot of money off stock options, but many of those people are leaving now that all of their options are used up. 

Revolving door. It’s hard to last more than a couple of years here. 

It’s always seemingly a few steps away from massive failure

Very few processes in place, so work is done extremely inefficiently

Very common to compose an email and see “This is no longer a valid Tesla address”

The entire Service organization shares one budget. I am scrimping to save $50 on software while a barely-related manager wastes literally tens of thousands of dollars a week on cool toys, and it all comes from the same place.

Everything’s urgent, and people try to name-drop that Elon’s watching this very project so I need to stop everything for them. Luckily those of us who have been around for a while see right through that charade.

Technically, no 401(k) match, though if you’re careful with the health benefits you choose, you can end up with some leftover that can be diverted into the 401(k).

Middle managers are very hit-and-miss. Many were promoted because a manager was needed and they were the only one who knew anything about the department. Much room for improvement here.

Minimal leadership training. No real employee development opportunities. The results are just as bad as you’d expect.

Massive inter-departmental struggles. Most of my problems can be traced to one power-hungry manager of a sister department. It only takes one person to ruin the work lives of many people. 

There are more meetings than I expected from this kind of company. Elon sent a great email about how wasteful meetings are, but people have fallen into old bad habits.

Completely ineffective HR department

Every department is grossly understaffed, just barely above the point of collapse. Nearly everyone has to work harder than they would if they were doing the same job at another company.

Anything that they can do in house, they’ll do, rather than outsourcing to a supplier. There are people who spend their whole careers deciding “make vs. buy”… no need for them here, it seems. This is corporate arrogance, and it reduces quality, wastes human resources, and slows time to market in many cases. A positive side effect is that more products are made here in California than would be if they were outsourced.

Inadequate parking

Note to hiring managers at other companies: Watch out if someone from Tesla has “Project Manager” on their title. Many of these people are just general office workers with no skills beyond harassing people via email.
Advice to Management
I was debating whether I approve of the CEO or not. 

On the one hand, he occasionally sends these excellent emails about business philosophy and avoiding siloing, wasteful meetings, and that managers are there to support their employees, not the other way around. 10/10 on that! When he leads an all-hands meeting, he usually has interesting things to say, especially if you can get him free-form thinking out loud during a Q&A session.

On the other hand, he is a relentless micro-manager and singlehandedly derails production, reduces product quality, makes hundreds of people have to work much harder, and causes massive waste because he wants to see every little detail and change those details at literally the last minute. It’s grossly inefficient and is ruining the company bit by bit. 

My advice to management: The company would work much better if Elon was only an idea man, locked up safely in a room somewhere, with his hands completely off of operations.

- I have been able to grow a global team and work with very smart, driven colleagues
- The sense of mission and drive is strong on most days
- The stock has done amazingly over the past 2 years.
","- Very disorganized processes and decision-making process. 
- There is a middle-management level developing that is composed of yes-men more concerned about perception than reality. This saps motivation and sense of mission
- Stock options are great but are actually distracting once you hit a certain valuation (yes, this is a first-world problem). People become less hungry and motivated, and other less-nice behaviors emerge.
Advice to Management
- Keep hiring people that know what they are doing and listen to them. 
- Streamline decision-making and budgeting, Elon should not need to approve spending.
-Do more skip-level 1:1s and cultivate your bench more.

","It was absolute chaos. They hired a bunch of us in Energy but then later fired so many people who have been with the company for so long. They switched jobs and job descriptions without any consent or prior notification to the people in those positions. I was hired to be their energy consultant but ended up standing in showrooms selling cars. I did not want that. They cut salaries. They sacked many people. I ended up quitting in about 9 months but it wasn't very pleasant. The only thing which kept me going was the people I worked with.

You should look at promoting from within instead of hiring from outside to have existing employees train them which creates a bitter environment. Specially when you have employees with years of experience and management neglects to tell them a position is available locally.

Considering I got fired because of Marijuana (I wasn't even high, I got drug tested because someone that doesn't like me said I was high.) I would say to do a tolerance level for most accurate info on Marijuana use, however a month after I was fired there was a bill passed to make discrimination against Marijuana illegal, so I guess that's already rectified.

","There are many challenges working at Tesla and to keep seeing the same things being written year after year is a sign. Long hours, flexible for some but not most especially manufacturing, management supervisors leads, yup the same story, they put people in charge who put people they make friends with in charge of other people and not experience in leadership. Those who supervise do not give good hard works the opportunities they should be given while others who just bs their way around the place get promoted and raises. They say “We want you to go home in a better condition than what came in to work. I was hurt my supervisor told others I was lying then the manager was focused on me being in the break room. Because he didn’t know I was on a special project and we were on break. Some people may care but the people I worked directly under did not! Pay is not great because a worker is worthy of his wages, they don’t see us like we’re worthy. Benefits are just okay and I say that because this is non-union work place you have no protection and our benefits should cost us close to nothing like longshoreman. For the automotive industry the pay should be should be a lot higher like Nummi was. The only pro for me was working at Tesla I learned a skill to go somewhere else and I only learned that from the few good people around me. After four years I never was fully vested and when I left they said it wasn’t four years but it was surly. I know everyone needs a job but Tesla is not very professional in manufacturing. There’s a lot of clicks going on with this street attitude and disrespect and racism thrives there on the floor. And watch out for the lift operators and tugs because they have the right away but according to OSHA they do not. Good luck!

","Little internal promotion/ avenues for growth. Disconnect between cooperate and stores. Poor management. Not to say there aren't any stars but many while I was there lacked relevant experience or even knowledge higher up. Loved my coworkers though.
Advice to Management
Not necessarily applicable any longer (not sure what it's like in late 2020) but there needs to be an emphasis on stronger hiring and internal employee growth and development. There are many bright and talented individuals throughout the company yet many including myself felt isolated and unsupported by the company. 

I ultimately left because of poor general management and a lack of performance based rewards (apart from hitting sales quotas) or recognition which could lead to promotion or growth into other areas in the company. 

This issue with a lack of recognition/opportunity, however, is somewhat inherent to the company's structure as my store manager was essentially the highest level employee that would see my work. The store manager unfortunately did not seem to have much of a voice in the company/ hierarchical chain and the impression left was that employees at the store level are tools to make sales and are otherwise overlooked as long as the stores reach their numbers.

Positive Outlook
I worked at Tesla full-time for more than a year
Pros
Paychecks will arrive on time, and the brand name itself is valuable on a resume in some circles.
Cons
The company model is designed to take more from the worker than is agreed to and to abuse the workers physically, financially, and psychologically until they’re drained at work and the families at home. Tesla keeps very few beyond a couple years, and only those that fit a specific mold that need needs to be fit for many reasons, not including things like intelligence or ability.

Advice to Management
Stand up for your employees and let upper management know what is really going on versus what the numbers on the surface show. Demand that employees be given proper 1-on-1 training before being held liable for making decisions for customers. Emphasize the need to maintain a good relationship with customers, not just put them on a back burner once you have their money. Stop doing the bare minimum, give adequate breaks for example, not just what the law forces you to give. Best advice: quit and get a job at a company that values people, not one that exploits people to the max.

Thu Oct 01 2020,Anonymous,"Fremont, CA",Former Employee ,"If you seek long-term career growth, keep looking...",2,"- Insurance benefits (health, life, etc.) and stock compensation are highly competitive compared to other employers.
- Ability to make an impact is what keeps folks here. Everyone is excited for the mission and deeply engaged in Tesla's products.
- Tesla is a very dynamic place to be, where you can add value in a very concentrated amount of time.
- Tesla will give you the opportunity to work on something in which you are not an expert, as Tesla values soft skills vs. hard knowledge.
","- Salary is at or slightly below average. Annual bonuses barely account for inflation. Equity grants are the main form of compensation. 
- Job insecurity is a constant. Over the three years I worked at Tesla, I witnessed about 6 rounds of layoffs. This has a negative impact on morale and everyone always has one foot out the door in preparation of being let go.
- Tesla does not value individual knowledge or expertise. Tesla is the only company I've worked at where it is acceptable to announce on a Wednesday that you are leaving the company and then be gone by Friday. There is no effort to transition knowledge or roles, leaving to inefficiencies and knowledge gaps. 
- High attrition due to constant layoffs creates an unstable environment in which management/senior leadership is constantly changing, strategy is changing and knowledge is lost. 
- Tesla is a VERY demanding company. There is almost an expectation for employees to avoid incurring expenses and therefore employees will often pay for business expenses out of pocket. You will be expected to work long hours and be flexible to do so especially at every end of quarter. Due to this level of demand, Tesla is not a supportive place for parents or those with significant personal demands. 
- Because everyone is overworked, it is difficult to get follow-through from other teams and constant follow-up is required.
- 80% of Tesla's workforce is under 35. While this creates many opportunities for those early in their career, there is often a lack of functional expertise and professional maturity. 
- Elon has final say on everything and will not be challenged by others, including his direct reports, for fear of losing their jobs.
- Due to constant attrition, people managers and leaders are regularly purged. This creates an environment in which employees are rewarded for being average performers for fear of being promoted and then eventually fired. Many people who have remained at Tesla in the long term (i.e. 7-10 years) have done so by flying under the radar and avoiding visibility, creating a perverse incentive for mediocrity. 
- Many departments are male dominated and have a ""bro"" culture, with few women at the Senior Manager level and above. There are few people of color at the Senior Manager level and above. There is a lack of diversity within leadership and a lack of effort to cultivate and retain a diverse pipeline of leadership talent. Diversity is not integrated into the company culture as demonstrated by the radio silence from senior leadership this year (aside from the sole Black executive). 
- Career growth is not well tracked or managed. There was a period of 1.5 years where no formal performance reviews (or salary increases) were conducted. Promotions and compensation are HIGHLY dependent on the manager. It is not uncommon for someone to be underpaid or not receive a promotion for years because a manager is more focused on managing their personal job security vs. advocating for the team.
Advice to Management
- Show employees that you care about them through low-cost or no-cost initiatives. Tesla could get more out of its workforce if it put forth effort into employee engagement and retention.
- Create a culture in which leadership/managers are enabled to advocate for their people.
- Release retention information as well as diversity information. Put effort into creating an inclusive environment across all teams, as well as at the Senior Manager level and above.

","It feels like you're in an abusive relationship . When it's good, it's good - when it's bad, it's really really bad. Very talented people are running scared, working as hard as they can, and hoping that things will get better - but are repeatedly treated horribly. 
It's a culture based on fear and a deep, ingrained undervaluation of its employees. HR is completely incompetent in addressing these issues and adds to the problem with deception and foolish, short-sighted decision making. There's a huge talent drain that no one seems to be concerned about - which in and of itself is highly concerning.

The toxic culture and undervaluing of employees is a major business risk. Bring in experienced senior leaders - particularly in HR - who aren't just egotistical puppets but can actually lead with morals and principles.

If Elon complains about money the higher management cuts employees and demote selected people. The only promotions depend on favorites not the skilled. No room for promotions or moving up. Tesla does not want to give cost of living raises. The current state of the area you have to work two jobs to make it or live in a low income housing.

","I've been working here for a bit over 3 years and overall, I would absolutely not recommend working here if you care about the following things.

The company is very cheap - they'll dish out bare minimum to their employees. Constant downgrade of office buildings to cheaper places, expensive food & snacks (nothing is free at Tesla), super over-flooded parking and solution is waiting in line for valet (thankfully we're now WFH with covid), switch to flexible PTO, no holiday parties, and basically anything to save money. It's the little things, and honestly there's just a constant display of frugality.

More importantly, real talent isn't rewarded. It isn't about completing a task in the most optimal way or designing outstanding/scalable solutions, it's about closing tickets. It doesn't matter if the code has to be redone in a couple years. If you have strong fundamentals, you won't find many truly inspirational engineers or people you can really learn from here - they leave quickly.

Very culturally diverse company and non-judgmental. You get to meet different people from all over the world. They are welcoming to open minded people and listen on how to improve the work flow. You'd get amazing perks to plenty of different places, appliances, clothing and discount on memberships.
","You're constantly overworked and overwhelmed with the work load EVERYDAY. If you aren't a quick learner and up to date with your work, they have no problem letting you go. For a company that's thriving and makes more than expected for their sales, they are sorely cheap when it comes to office supplies or basic essentials for the lunch room. Your manager will be pulled into projects constantly (sometimes for other departments) so they aren't necessarily focused on the team. Most of the time, upper management won't make time to get to know you. The company will take an easy but unfair way of letting people go.

Unprofessional. Unorganized. Unqualified. The management here is the absolute worst with little to no understanding of what it takes to run a warehouse or manage a team but yet they get promoted for being there for so long, coming from target, and taking credit for other people’s ideas and the hourly workers hard work, Oh and for gossiping, arts and crafts, keeping a circle of friends who are allowed to slack off as long as they provide information to get people fired and using fear of getting written out of a job as their only way of maintaining power. Constantly out of supplies to perform your basic job, and threatened and harassed any time you fall under their “expectations” without trying to help you. Little to no training or support except for the leads and the inventory guys who are always running and sweating to try and put out the dumpsterfires that the supervisor ignores as she sits on her desk talking with her friend all day long. The loading area is a death trap waiting to happen with no space to move and still expected to offload full trailers. The hours are brutal and they apparently can call overtime at any time and label it mandatory. HR is almost non existent and if you do happen to get someone to hear you it gets swept under the rug by the very same supervisors. Don’t buy in to the promise of a great car company or growing here,Tesla is great but the Pomona warehouse is an absolute joke. Some advice: stop blaming people who quit for the lies you tell we quit for a reason, and fire the people with no management experience that are collecting salary for doing nothing and hire experienced professionals.

Wed Jun 17 2020, Production Associate,"Sparks, NV",Current Employee ,I LOVE WORKING AT TESLA,0,"This is my dream job seriously what I have been searching for. Awsome helth insurance like the best I have ever had the opportunity to get at little to NO cost to the employee (might as well take the high insurance plan for the price lets just say that) free food in the cafeteria also food you can purchase in the cafeteria cooked right in front of you or thay have a little market you can buy stuff at plus the food trucks come on site at lunch times, lots of perks outside of work from discounts on phone plans to discounts on daycare cost. Honestly this is the most simple job I have ever had for the awsome pay rate they give us. Very comfortable atmosphere at Tesla we are like a big Family truthfully we don't take offense we just work we are all there for the same reason we are definitely a team. We work long hours (12 hour shifts) but its well worth it when we get 3-4 day weekends. Work clothing is provided by Tesla but you can also wear your own personal clothing as long as it is up to code they provide steel toed shoes as well. PTO is easy to obtain you could potentially take a paid day off every month. You can move up in the company very fast as long as you have the drive and put in the effort to do so I have worked for companies that require alot more physical and mental labor for a lot less pay and terrible benefits so I think Ill stay at Tesla as long as they will keep me. Tesla is good to their employees I have found a job that I truly love with Tesla.
","They have a 401 K plan but they don't match you. No smoking on campus so if you smoke cigarettes then quit while at work or plan to hide in your car with the windows rolled up be on the look out for security this could be a fireable offense. Some people should never even be hired but they do give people a chance more then other companies. Long 12 hour shifts so our 4 day work weeks are kind of long you have no othe option unless you are an engineer then you work 5 days a week 8 hours a day. .

Advice to Management
I would say listen to the lifeblood of the energy side, the installers. Many of them feel obligated to risk physical and mental health to complete jobs within the grueling time constraints. Also the hourly rate is so low that they push themselves to obtain time based bonuses. It isn't sustainable for the human body to work at that pace for prolonged stretches of time. Occasionally is fine, but 12 - 14 hours a day five days a week is not safe especially considering we work with electricity and one mistake is all it takes to lose your life on the job or get seriously hurt.

","Constantly finding ways to lay off employees, constantly finding ways to reduce pay for more work, management works to bully you into leaving. You have no support.

Value your employees as people. Without them you do not get your bonus. They will not show their true potential if you do not treat them well. Tesla could be amazing and progressive but that means treating people like they are human and calling for responsibility.

Advice to Management
I've noticed that some departments get a lot more management attention than others at GigaNV. Don't glance over efforts that don't require a wrench when it comes to maintenance. The visibility and efficacy of an individual are not always directly correlated. 

Favouritism is toxicity and I've already witnessed two people in maintenance quit over it (though they kept quiet about it). There are several more who are considering it- it's a common theme among technicians I talk to in some under-appreciated zones. I must admit just hearing about it has already affected my morale considerably. The brain-drain is real here and we really need to focus on keeping talent close to heart.

Intimidation culture
Will treat you less than a human being
Unsafe work environment

Personnel in management are inexperienced children trying to impress their ""equals"" creating a culture of idiocy and immature popularity club. 

If you're a socially ""attractive"" white male in your 20's, you'll be promoted to an undeserving management position inflating your ego to treat people below you like garbage. HR is a joke. Office personnel is just a big fraternity/sorority. What foul thing are you willing to do for Tesla? If you fit in at an egotistical shallow community, Tesla is your place to apply. 

If you're trying to apply for a production associate (or entry level manufacturing positions) be ready to be treated like garbage. Your hard work will only reflect good on others and opportunity to move up depends on how good you look with the rest of the ""team"". Be aware, they will trick you to make you feel like you're in a safe environment and that you matter. During a fire inside the building, the personnel was never evacuated and forced to ""cleaning duty"" while being under a cloud of smoke that was ""irritating but safe for breathing"". BEWARE, it's a glorified sweatshop.

I was able to make more than 6 figures in my first year, that’s including my hourly and commission. I feel like Tesla has really taken cared of me. A lot of nice people willing to help.
","Constant change but not for the better. Meaning you have to adapt immediately or you will sink in low. I made 135k from work and 7k thru stocks in the year of 2019. I am afraid those days are gone. I used to be always number 1 in my office and number 2 nationwide thinking that I actually hit the lottery with this career. Now everyone has the same hourly rate and no more commission, meaning people who were on the bottom that were not actually producing as much as I am are now making the same as you. People who used to sell a lot of used Teslas who were making possibly closed to a quarter million are now just going to make probably barely 6 figures. That is no fun and it affects everyone’s lives. Of course not so much for people who weren’t even close to reaching the monthly goals. I was a superman in sales and now that is all gone.

Thousands of call requests are coming in, they expect you to clear all of them and you will have a lot of angry customers on your response time. It is not fair but it is still better than working for anywhere else. It is still the best career I’ve ever had.

Commissions went from getting paid the next month to no commissions at all but getting bonus from the quarter. Meaning, you start fresh on Jan and finish on March, you won’t get your bonus until the end of May.

Last time I check, Sales people should be compensated based on their results and not the hours they put in.

Management is a joke. They have leaders in place who have never been a recruiter before and when you challenge them or ask for guidance they write you off as a nuisance. If you want to move up or change teams you better be in on the ""inner circle"" otherwise you will never be able to move up. The arrogance and favoritism in this place is astounding. Tesla does not care about their employees. Last year they had two MASSIVE layoffs and only gave severace to those people in places where it was mandatory - like is California. But if you worked in Nevada you got absolutely nothing. I love what Tesla stands for but moving to a new state and getting laid off after less than a year is awful. I would not recommend anyone to work here unfortunately. Especially if you are considering moving for this company.

Advice to Management
The office environment tends to create cliques, and this can cost the company valuable employees. My number one suggestion would be an in depth 360 View of the entire situation and listen to those on the front lines before making a decision to separate an employee. Often a company may lose those who are experienced, protective, and share the overall vision and mission of the company. Never promote individuals from one department to a leadership or judgment role of another department if they do not have experience doing the job of those they are in charge of judging the quality of. Most specifically, I would never promote a person from a documents team, who has never experience the challenges of assisting a customer on the telephone, into a role where they now judge the quality of those on the frontline answering the telephones. If you haven't experienced a specific task, a person really has no experience leading to a role judging the quality of that task. 

 Additionally, Ideas and employees shares with a coworker through personal communication or their personal goals or ideas, Should not become the property of a manager or management to profit from their personal life because they have access to listen to, view, or receive indirectly. Furthermore, ensure in individual is logged out of every application website or tool personally or for business on their company laptop before being separated from the company. 

 Integrity. And sure integrity is Paramount. Investigate situations where it may be lacking.
 Profit sharing, If an employee notices conceives or recognizes a new Avenue for the business that could potentially gain the business billions of dollars, share with that individual fairly for their contribution. 
 They just may happen to have a bridge to close the gap in a company's mission.

The projects I get to work on are right up my alley, challenging, and stretch my ability to allow me to learn on the job. The compensation is adequate for the work put in, and I feel valued every day at work. Team around me is encouraging and kind which creates a pleasant place to go into work each day.
","The only con I can perceive is that Tesla is a high stress, high pace environment. People here work really hard and get things done. I wouldn’t say it is for everyone, but for a lot of people they would fit right in and feel at home.
Advice to Management
From my perspective, management is doing a stellar job at running the company and maintaining a great work environment. Feedback is recieved and given adequately, there is a minimum level of micromanaging, and everyone is respectful and willing to work together to solve issues regardless of hierarchy. It is really encouraging to work under management I can look at as leadership.

I worked at Tesla full-time for more than a year
Pros
great coworkers, amazing direct-leadership, great location and comfortable atmosphere.
Great benefits, too. Company discounts + Lyra (free mental health), even commute reimbursement for Lyft or the bus.

I LOVED my coworkers and I miss going into the office almost every day since I quit -- it felt like I was hanging out with friends all day, we just happened to be doing work-related activities.
Cons
""Higher-Ups"" decisions affected everyone on the ground floor, constant threat of layoffs had everyone stressed out. 
Didn't matter to corporate if you were a top performer, you could easily be let go in attempt to make profit that year.
Poor communication between departments and upper-management.
Were it not for these issues causing frequent anxiety, I would not have left.
Maybe after the company evens out from absorbing SolarCity, things will be better. I'd consider returning, if that were the case.
Advice to Management
The Design team management was top tier, they were transparent with us and trusted us to make the right decisions. They deserve so much more appreciation than they receive.
Anyone above the department directors, however -- you need to show your appreciation for your employees instead of just saying the words we want to hear.
Many of them work really hard only to be met with disappointment -- like when their entire team gets laid off, or the position they've been working towards for months is suddenly removed from the company.
Stop dumping all of the ""dumpster fires"" on the same Customer Care teams over and over and then expecting those teammates to be okay afterwards. Listen to them and create better action plans for both your employees AND your customers.
Most of all -- STOP changing peoples' job descriptions with no warning. You can't just tell a large group of people they now have an entirely different job title with different skill sets, and they either accept it or quit.

Sat Nov 02 2019, Production Associate,"Sparks, NV",Former Employee ,"Great career opportunities, relatively flat management structure",0,"Tesla offers Performance bonuses every 6 months, up to $7000 paid quarterly over 1 year. This is QUITE a substantial bonus on top of $17.50 hourly base pay, and in my opinion is an outstanding way to compensate employees. It encourages employees to give their all, all the time, as an extra $14,000 yearly increases your pay from $17.50 to approximately $25.00 when averaged out.
","You do get paid time off, but only 10 days a year, and these count as your sick days as well. If you don't have enough PTO and get sick, there is a point system in place. 5 points gets you fired, and each missed day is 2 points. Half a point for up to 15 minutes late, 1 point up to 2 hours late. You must be very careful not to use your PTO until you have several days built up, as you will need a cushion in case you get sick.

In a large facility such as the Gigafactory, it is very difficult to keep lines of communication clear and open, and it is VITAL. Low to mid level management does very well considering the difficulty of the task, but there is always room for improvement. Also, I believe the PTO system needs refinement.

","Limited resources, constant backlog on parts and service plus a difficult clientele leads to really hectic workdays. You're dealing with a lot of engineers as customers talking about a car that they're confident they have more knowledge about because they work in the industry or read something on Reddit. It's a lot of emotion involved for a vehicle (understandably so) but emotional intelligence is very critical and you have to be tough-skinned due deal with the rollercoaster of customer expectations vs reality.

Location location location. Poor facility locations tended to be 90% of the root cause of any complications at each service center that I worked at and or visited. Lack of parking due to shared logistics typically with delivery created internal turf wars and poor execution of service practices. I feel there is room for more tiers of job creation within the service center model. Most advisors got deterred to continue with the company knowing the next stop was typically assistant manager which could take years but nothing in between other than tiers of advisor.

Tue Oct 08 2019, SERVICE ADVISOR,"Owings Mills, MD",Former Employee ,Worst 11 months of my life,12,"I went through 5 interviews to get this position. When I received the offer I felt like I made such a big accomplishment and I felt proud to wear the Tesla ""T"". Soon after I started I realized the only perks were the benefits and saying you worked for the company. This job drained me physically and mentally. Stressed me out so bad that I have stress related illnesses... you add it up.

The service managers for reference were jokes. I mean so much of a joke they could get an award for it. First conversation with my manager was him scolding me for not ""looking happy"" enough and rudely reminding me how many people want my position. (or so he thought) Look here if the work environment is terrible, management is terrible and don't get me started on the people who own the Teslas. They are some of the most rude and incompetent humans you will come across. PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE HAPPY. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DONT DO YOUR JOBS AS MANAGERS TO MAINTAIN A GOOD ENVIRONMENT. They would rather stand around and talk about their home improvement projects like anyone cared.

Management is supposed to support and LEAD their team. There would be constant changes on what was covered under warranty and what was not because the company is so DESPERATE for money. management would tell us to enforce a rule and when the customers started to be belligerent they would come up and just give them what they wanted. Whats your purpose? Honestly? To ""work"" from home and be mysteriously busy? Tire rotations went from $87.50 to almost $100. i mean i give it to Tesla they are smart because they know their customer base. The customers are so pressed to flaunt their wealth they will pay these absurd prices so hey I guess if you're into being a lack luster company keep going.

All im saying is if you want to maintain your mental and physical health dont work here. It sounds cool to say you do and the jackets are cool but you can buy the same ones on tesla.com.

They are hiring for a Service Advisor now at Tesla in Owings Mills,MD and if you see this review and actually have a SPINE dont do it. BUT If you are an adult willing to take abuse for some money go right ahead you will fit right in. If you ask all the middle aged men there they will tell you that the only reason they stay is for the benefits. Tesla isn't all its cracked up to be...... unfortunately. I will forever be disappointed.

Fri Oct 18 2019, Production Lead,"Reno, NV",Former Employee ,Huge overturn rate for production workers. TERRIBLE jr leadership.,3,"The company is doing great things. Great health insurance.
","Nobody makes a career here. NOBODY. That goes up and down the chain of command. Huge hire/fire mentality.

Terrible junior leadership. Tesla hired practically anyone for a supervisor position from 2016-2018. 
Now the middle management is composed of 25 yo's that are far too inexperienced to lead/manage 50+ people. I have seen supervisors cuss out workers, have relations with their Associates, come in half a day late multiple consecutive times and don't get a slap on the wrist, all while they make their 70k. 
I've also seen the same supervisors write up Associates for sitting down or checking their phone for ""Tesla Team Messages."" There's a no cell phone policy for production reason, but there's also the contradicting, ""check you're messages b/c I need you over here now!""
Now these ""write ups"" will bar promotions and internal movement for 6-12 months. 
While anecdotal stories very similar to this happen TIME and TIME again.. and the senior leadership wonders why there's such a terrible work culture.

There's many associates with mba's or are veterans, that have led teams far longer than the children that were put in jr management positions, that are trying to get there leg in the door. There's also a great cause with the company that would be motivating, however, its hugely undermined by JR leadership. 

It would be easy to say keep your head down and just do the grind till you can transfer, but when a supervisor writes an entire section up for one individual sitting down on a 12 hour shift.. things get out of hand. 

This company has the worst turn-over rate/work culture that I have ever worked with.
Advice to Management
The idea might rise that you should get your associate managers to talk with the production workers about their concerns. However, from what I've seen, this won't do anything. There's too much favoritism and politics where the AM's will cover for their immediate Jr supervisors. 

Have an unbiased 3rd party team come in and figure out what needs to be done and escalate it from there.

It had a lot of great new ideas to implement to always appear to be ahead of the curve compared to many other companies. I had the flexibility to work from home, though working with teammates in the office was always valuable to help evaluate difficult design situations. I genuinely enjoyed giving customers the best systems I could because it felt like I was helping them in meaningful ways (e.g., alleviating power outages).
","Much of my time was spent debugging issues or discovering workarounds just to actually get work done. At times, there appeared to be a culture of ""gaming the system"" to appear more successful (e.g., taking on more, easier designs as opposed to the difficult ones that could take a day or more to complete) which never really got addressed. The staggered work schedules were bizarre; I got assigned to a project where its training was on my days off, so I had to figure it out on my own; having to communicate to knowledgeable teams was immensely frustrating because our work schedules only aligned a few days of the week. Also, hearing something to the effect of ""We're downsizing to ensure we will never have to do this again"" gets old after the first time.

Please be more proactive in ensuring program issues/bugs get resolved. Multiple emails about workarounds did not contribute to feeling like I worked for a company who strove to be the best.

There was an employee having a panic attack. Their lead smiled and laughed at the matter. This company will continue to not reach fruition if the HR, recruiters and management start being fired and/or start changing how things have been going. This place used to be my dream job. I came in happy to burn every inch of myself into every square inch into this place. Most of senior management dont even have half the drive I had for the giga. You guys really did a great job btw letting the Giga go to crap! For Tesla's mission statement though... I believed by working for a company like this I was saving the world.

Please listen to employee feedback and hire someone capable to lead a team and not someone with zero management experience. You hire a mechanic to lead a big team but has no experience doing any type of leadership jobs, they most likely will fail. Might as well pay the mechanic more for doing a good job or properly train them to move into a leadership role so this person will not be set up for failure. Some leaders are not trained in the leadership positions, but they are well trained in the actual labor positions such as the lines or conveyance or whatever department they are in. There needs to be someone looking at this and not someone that's close to the team. There has been too many cases of favoritism for people getting moved up because they are friends with someone or they like this person better than this other person even though that other person may have the skill and knowledge for doing the job better. This is sad, but true and i'm sure other companies see this as well.

You have a great number of responsibilities - the degree of ownership is 5x-10x what I experienced at Apple. In my old jobs there would be 5+ people doing what I do, with all of us covering a fraction. It is genuinely interesting getting to work on such rapid projects, though unfortunately the speed of these projects is determined at the top, usually arbitrarily, and quality suffers a lot more than people are aware. But again, the work is really interesting and if you get far enough outside of the Bay Area and meet people who don't know better, they're still impressed by the name, for what its worth.
","Elon and his little buddy Jerome are absolute tyrants and make a mockery of whatever razor thin HR standards are left here. You can have an entire room of amazing, experienced employees explaining a situation with clear evidence and proposed solutions but if one of these guys is in a bad mood - which seems to be most of the time - then discussions will get cut short, the meeting devolves rapidly into one of them shouting and then nothing gets done. It is painful to watch all of this potential being wasted, as more and more of the best people I (used to) work with quit out of frustration or are pushed out for daring to say something even slightly different than what upper management thinks. Other people complain about the work-life balance, lack of perks, etc, but none of that would (or should) matter if we had calm, professional leaders.
