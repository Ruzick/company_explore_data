Look at the work folks are doing, and how well they are doing it. There is a culture of keeping and promoting folks who have simply been around for a while. There are many associates that are strong employees who work well above their level and pay grade, yet do not get rewarded like the ""lifers"" do. It will drive good talent to leave.

","Initially there were some struggles as we tried to get the pay grades raised for paralegals to be on par with other large corporations in the area. This issue was resolved a number of years ago, and paralegals received a bump in pay in addition to the annual merit increase. One ""con"" - it is somewhat difficult to get promoted to Managing Paralegal. Promotion is based on ""business need"" of the particular legal division, funding and number of paralegals in that division. Therefore, you could be in a situation whereby you have seniority and are performing at a level worthy of Managing Paralegal; however, you may be stuck in the Senior Paralegal slot indefinitely, waiting for a Managing Paralegal to leave/retire, or waiting for your division to have the funding and the ""business need"", which is subjective on the part of HR.

You have to wear your uniform with pride and dignity
","There are no challenges sometimes customers can be very demanding but you have to listen to their complaints and go the extra mile to make them happy after working on an aircraft for Delta for 28 years and working in customer care and dealing with unhappy people you want to go the extra mile and do what ever can be done to make people. 🐍 there are many things at our finger tips example comping a meal,
Giving them points or upgrading a room or buying them a drink at the bar. We all should be lucky to be a Marriott employee and be proud.
Advice to Management
The only advice is to give employees the power and ability to give the customer what ever it takes to make them happy you never want to say to someone I cannot do something I have to check with a manager, that gives the customer the feeling you cannot take care of them because you can not help them then the customer feels talking to the employee is waisting time, the customer will get more frustrated and angry
That is not a good thing. You have to remember that many of the customers have status and want to be catered to it is up to the employee to do that. You never want to loose a customer many hotels and airlines will honor the miles and status and convert them over then that customer is gone that does not take into consideration of what the will write on line or tell their company who could also be a big Westin or Marriott supporter. Great service is the name of the game and also looking professional behind the desk is equally important you must wear your uniform with pride.Looking good at work makes customers respect you. Take your uniform to the dry cleaner and look professional. You are repeating the most elegant hotel chain in the world wear it on your sleeve.

-Very team oriented and tight knit operations team. We loved helping each other out, and valued our staff service.
","-The pay can at times feel undercut.
-Sales team can be extremely cliquey and uninviting.
 -Sales can also become defensive when you’re best interest is to protect the operations of the hotel. 
-Sales serves no interest in looking out for the team as a whole. All they care about is making their numbers, which is hurtful to the team for those who have to execute. 
- Very LEAN in staffing. This causes other job descriptions to pick up more tasks which causes burnout. 
-No OSR support with absent GM, Senior Event Manager, and Director of Human Resource positions vacant at the same time. There was a part-time Director of HR, but managed another property and had unpredictable office hours.
Advice to Management
-Coach the sales team (on and off property) with proper negotiation skills. 
-Have off property Sales team pulse check turnover process. Whether that is calling to inform of very specific details/requests to property, or calling the property at the end of the day to see if there are any questions. Small changes like this will tremendously improve property relationships, and improve the level of service for groups. This will also make hotel properties feel valued and want to go above and beyond for the Sales team in order to make it work.

Provide better pay for those with higher education and more experience. Training should go at the individuals speed, not the same speed for everyone.

","Sometimes, people were caught in the bubble if they did not have experience outside of Marriott or even hospitality and that could lead in some cases to narrowed thinking. As a result, it was not always the best idea that we moved forward with. From time to time the structure could be a little confining for someone who is looking to grow and some promotions were political, rather than merit based.
Advice to Management
Mostly, keep up the good work. For some things, you may need a fresh perspective. I highly recommend basing promotions on merit rather than politics. For sales, the bonus structure is not motivational but seems punitive so ends up being a negative rather than an encouraging factor.

Instead, I was publicly humiliated, ridiculed, and absolutely broken as a person. I would not recommend working here even to my worst enemy.

Give your finance leaders more flexibility to work the way they want to. So long as the job gets completed in an honest and respectful manner, it should not matter how long the leader is on property.

They want to make sure they keep people in suspense so as not to have a shallow talent pool at the end of this.

For some reason, great reputation of this employer stops at the door to IT. Employ fair trade IT worker practices. Extra hours from immigrant service providers comes at a cost to their health and wellness. So walk the talk, be humane, bar after hours expectations and reduce associate churn.

","They got rid of all of the great people under the umbrella of COVID. What they did was really a salary dump. They downsized and told everyone they can post for the remaining positions and then they cherry picked everyone that had around 5 or 7 years worth of experience and didn't allow very productive team members a chance to interview even though the COO of the company said that consideration would be given to time in position etc.. I wouldn't recommend working for the company in an IT capacity because all of the signs are there to outsource all of IT.
Advice to Management
When you have to do a reorganization stay true to what you say. You give false hope to all of the qualified tenured associates especially in IT saying that you will take into account the years in position and reviews. Then you call back people that strive to get even an average review and hire your ""friends"" to be in senior management role when a majority didn't manage a single person. You not only insult those that didn't get a chance to interview but you set your ""friends"" up for failure.

","The company is not consistent between what they promote vs what they actually practice. Long time employees might very well find themselves cast aside with no regards to loyalty, and office politics can be extremely toxic depending on which department you are in.

Advice to Management
Managers have tough jobs to run their departments well while keeping employees satisfied and happy. Too often they tend to gloss over the realities of the business with false promises of skyrocketing careers and opportunities. All too often I have heard managers deceptively counseling their employees with false promises that if they only wait it out just a LITTLE bit longer they'll have their shot at promotion and growth. It's understandable that the business relies on low wages and flexible hours to operate, but that is not what we are told when we go into the job. Just be upfront about the expectations and realities of working for Marriott. You are underpaid at the bottom, and if thats ok with you then you maybe can have a shot at a decent paying job higher up.

Wed Sep 23 2020, At Your Service Agent,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,"One of the funnest jobs I’ve ever had, very easy to move up in the company.",0,"I liked it because coworkers are so nice, but what can you expect working in hospitality? They have a lot of meetings for us where they provide snacks and just fun things for employees like contests. It’s very easy to move up in the company, I was promoted three times in 2 years, hospitality also looks great on your resume. I consider myself an introvert and it really helped me get out of my shell even though some days were hard.
","The pay is okay. Compared to other phone operating jobs, $13.25 is fairly low especially for the things we have to put up with. The company claims to be all about treating the employees right but managers will easily override restrictions they shove down our throat just to make a guest with status happy. I’ve told guests no many times only for a manager to cave in and say yes, this makes the guests with status entitled little brats who know they can get what they want if they just ask for a manager and give us a hard enough time. Some of the people at the top seem to have no idea of the challenges that come with hospitality. Hospitality is “the customer is always right” times a billion and it gets hard. I was one of the many employees who was furloughed and while I know hospitality was hit especially hard because of COVID-19, it sucked not knowing where I was going to get my next paycheck or pay. I think they should’ve helped a little with that since they claim to take care of the employees. Also if there’s a manger who makes a lot of money for the company yet is horrible to the employees with the HR reports to prove it, they won’t do anything. All they care about is their pockets.
Advice to Management
Stick to the rules despite the status of the guests. It’s very disheartening when we enforce the rules that are put in place only for management to give in as soon as the guest asks them for it. I understand that guests of status contribute to the hotel a lot but the way they speak or act with employees is sometimes unacceptable, very disrespectful and we just need y’all to have our backs. Show that you really are all about taking care of your employees.

Thu Oct 15 2020, Food Service,"Dallas, TX",Former Employee ,Terrible Company Overall,0,"There are not many pro's other than you can make money since it's a job.
","Literally everything you can think of when you think of a nightmare company. Management not caring about work/life balance. Will work you until 4am the night before then have you on the schedule for 7am the next day. Pick and choose when to be strict, no open door policy, HR doesn't help when needed, you need anything as a previous employee (like W2's) they give you a huge run around, and even go as far as to hanging up on you if you call the support number after waiting hours to speak to someone. This is not a joke... this company will use you until they don't need or want you anymore. You can give your entire life to these people and they would say thanks then kick you right out the door. No support from management during shifts or after, and the only way to move up is to brown nose. It's a frustrating company to work for and it doesn't get any better after you quit or get fired.
