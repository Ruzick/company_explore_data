Advice to Management
Learn about authentic leadership. Stop putting managers in positions to oversee roles they are clueless about. The favoritism is obnoxious. Really connect (versus a quarterly call) with your staff to capture a different perspective on the way things are really being managed. Require 360 degree feedback and walk your talk.

","The bank somehow does not have an effective plan to retain talent especially the mid level Senior programmers in the Tech side and there has been lot of leavers going to Tech companies or competitors. Unless the person makes an effort to find an offer outside and then tries to match salary the overall compensations remains quite stagnant and below par with industry standards as your experience increases. This puts people especially looking for permanent residency at risk during their Labor approval.
Advice to Management
Understand the bank would like to do as much cost save as possible but the distribution of the compensation in the Tech side seems just even when talents of people who really deliver isnt exactly in that manner. This creates a lot of imbalance and angst among performing candidates when they feel they dont what they deserve in spite of the long hours they put to go the extra mile for the firm.

Hire more people as the call volume is extremely high. It’s get worse after every tax season. Pay people fairly so the stress of the job seems worth it. People aren’t robots but are expected to perform as such. Micromanaging is the culture in a performance based environment so I can’t offer any advice there.

One thing that always threw me off was their customer satisfaction survey. Clients were unhappy with products, long wait times, and many other reasons that were not under bank employees' control. So no matter how hard we worked to help a client when they received a survey, they would give us a bad rating. Then, top management would blame the branch employees and deduct our bounces as punishment. I believe that was an extremely unfair business practice. Bank employees are never appreciated and most of them don't earn enough to live a decent life in the bay area.
Advice to Management
Smart, ambitious, and top performer employees get bored quickly, so they leave. If you want to keep them, try to hear them and understand their needs. Many of your experienced employees have figured out how to play the system in order to earn higher bonuses. Stop seeing your people through the lens of numbers. Those numbers are not accurate and cannot be solely used as a performance measurement.

","The company is incredibly ambitious and greedy. They have eliminated many things to make the employees feel appreciated from coffee, water coffee pots and even essentials in the break room for the employees to keep clean to team building activities funds, employee of the month incentives, anniversary bonuses or gifts, parties, awards. Although they are a bank, they don’t keep their own employees being flexible in credit solutions for the employees to enjoy financial products as well. They simply don’t care for recognition at all or helping the employee grown in any way. However, focus on what you are not doing to their satisfaction. You are always criticized and pressured. You spend whole days without taking lunch (they were sued by former employees for it) they overwork and mistreat employees as they only care for customers to be seen and not for employees to have a healthy work environment. This is the reason for many employees taking FMLA and banking center being consistently understaffed.
Advice to Management
Restructured the whole system to really care for the employees first and not the numbers. If your employees are unhappy hour revenue suffers even if you don’t see it.

Also, being promoted is based on who you know, not your metrics. I was annual top performer interested in relationship banker position, and would get told, I needed to increase my referral numbers, even though I was #1 in the market and exceeded 8% on a regular basis. Just awful culture.
Advice to Management
Help out the tellers more. I know sales are the most important thing at the branch because that's what your bonuses depend on, but the way you treat humans is important. Help your tellers, even it is just by engaging with the line. My managers never talked to the line, and many times would hide because they knew the customers in the line were mad. They would hide in the break room or back by the teller stations in the closed drive through area and mouth the words ""I'm hiding"" at me. Just, be a team player and help your tellers.

","Easy to get lost in the bureaucracy. Performance reviews are maddening.
Advice to Management
Change your performance review process.

I was management for several years here and then left and went back for a short stint as a contractor. So this is based on several years working there in a management position.

This might not be true for all areas, but the company's big on consistency and one-size fits all, so I suspect it's a fair number. I can only speak to a handful of software development areas that I have experience with.

Middle management is hamstrung. They're at the mercy of budgets, strategic decisions, etc., which you would expect. One of the most maddening things about that is that performance evaluations are based on a curve. 

The expectation is that there will always be a percentage of a team that will be low performers and an even smaller percentage that will be high performers.

This means sometimes people can get a poor performance review and it has nothing to do with their actual performance. If you have a high functioning team somebody has to get the short straw.

This turns into a situation where the only way to be rewarded is to be perceived to have value by the immediate management, which usually is something that gets passed down from a higher level executive.

If you have two people and they're both really good performers but are doing different but complementary jobs, both of which are vital, the one who's going to be rated higher is the one whose value the manager understands.

If you have someone who came up through development as a manager, technical skill might be the only thing they really get and the person who has a deeper understanding of the business that allows the development to get done in the first place, enh, maybe not so much.

So even if your job is essential, if it doesn't fit management's perception of essential it's easy to be seen as a lower performer, regardless of what your actual job is.

And it's probably not because they hate you. A lot of the time it's because they don't know you well enough.

Anyway, advice to management, change your performance review process. I have seen nothing at that company that destroys morale more than that.

Advice to Management
I thought it was great at first, they give training very consistently at least once a week they make sure you understand what you’re doing and what’s basically going on. The customers are awesome to deal with for the most part. However, when I was soon to give birth I went on short-term leave and I was not approved after two weeks or being on my short term leave, but i was never notified of this. When I gave birth I had called to let them know I had the baby via emergency c-section( 28 days later) and their response was that my unpaid short term was not approved so i could not get my maternity leave pay. I was unable to get the short term leave so I was unable to get my maternity leave pay and they still held on to me for 9 months meaning I was unable to get any money whatsoever for the year. Being that this year is a big year for needing money they really set me back. Really sad they’d do This tô me I hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else.

I have been working at Bank of America full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Work life balance is very good for many teams if not all. Benefits like maternity leave and 401(k) are very generous. Company culture is great, values the contributions of employees with acknowledgements.
Cons
For employees who are not interested in people management roles, the opportunity to move up is very limited. Not very easy to change roles internally if one wants to change a specialization, even if having the right education level.

","Way to many metrics and “behaviors” to achieve. They hide their sales pressure by calling the metrics behaviors when in realty they are focused on one thing, making a sale.
Management can be wildly different in what they want per branch making it difficult for clients to understand why one branch can help and another a mile away cannot.
Almost every RM does not want to be an RM. I would estimate that about 90% in this role would really like to find a different job.
Advice to Management
There are 9 behaviors that we are supposed to do with every client. 9.... This excludes any kind of offers or actual helping/speaking with the client. Even if I was able to do all 9 every time like it is expected, each client would take over 30 minutes just for that alone. I cannot do life plan, discover tool, track in bound interaction, 60 second review, present offers, road maps, meet the coach, DAS, email, and follow up appointment with every client. Yet for some reason every 6 months is some new behavior we are supposed to incorporate with all of our clients. Yet I have yet to see any system upgrades that make my actual work smoother. Instead my systems crash at least 5 times a day and they are old and clunky. The computers we use are awful, they take 10 minutes just to get to the Home Screen every morning. Moynihan constantly talks about high tech high touch but there is no high tech in any of the branches. I am fairly certain there is no high tech anywhere, besides maybe the trading desks. Every call center associate I call tells me there system is slow, every bankers system is slow, every tellers system is slow. Why? If google or Amazon were to start doing banking they would immediately blow us out of the water with optimized systems. All in all the bank needs to streamline so much. Actually doing the work I need to do shouldn’t have so many obstacles.

Work life balance can be flexible, but can be over extended on time if management needs you. Great annual reviews that actually make a difference with associates. Great roles to transition into with experience. Excellence banking experience for future career growth and career change. Professional work environment.
","Overwhelming as you start growing up the ladder. Stress if not managed can eat you alive. I don’t mean this lightly. It can be very overwhelming with such large goals that people are constantly going on leave or taking time off for their mental health. I would say the biggest con is that people tend to not get a lot of one on one attention when it comes to business growth as a individual. Things change so fast that we sometime have managers that don’t invest enough in giving back the information to colleagues which can slow down the adaption of most employees and yet managers then wonder why no one knows what we are aiming for as a business model together in their markets or regions. This can be extremely stressful to those who want to advance and grow rapidly in business which then in turn makes them decide to leave or work on other paths of careers that move a bit quicker.
Advice to Management
Great company. Keep up the incredible work. I would recommend to just work on career development and camaraderie as a whole. Putting this type of effort in recognition and skill building would really enhance associate skills to handle more tasks and roles and in turn provide more value to clients and the business. Associates that are given more responsibility and belief would make them want to stay longer. This is by far my biggest recommendation.

Tue Dec 08 2020, Mortgage Loan Closer,"Tampa, FL",Current Employee ,Great place to enter mortgage industry,0,"Benefits. Generous PTO and Sick Pay. Overtime. Good place to get your feet wet in the mortgage industry. Work from home during Covid.
","They took away bonuses in First mortgage and that felt like a low blow. Our salaries are not that great according to industry standards and so that was a way to earn more income. This is my first mortgage job and I do not feel like I was well trained. My manager is always swamped and I do not feel like she is able to manage well because of the workload placed upon her. I do not feel like this is a long term career but a starting point. Changes are made without notice. We are expected to do other people's work if they are behind on their load and then we in turn get behind
 For a big company they need to be more in tune with the latest in the Mortgage industry and then cascade that down in a well planned training. Trainings feel like long rants without barely any pause. Overall BOA is a good company but First Mortgage needs serious work.

Neutral Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Bank of America full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Lots of freedom; plan your schedule, lead bank associates to help you get leads and can make a lot of money. Learn how to underwrite and be a lender. You focus only on getting loans.
Cons
Work 7 days a week, no overtime and your life is just like a realtor. Your prequal letters get used by your clients that show to their other lender for better rates. Lots of competition amongst other lenders and also your office. Company culture sucks, everyone is struggling. Many borrowers are not qualified and I have witnessed a fair share of unethical practices in lending. Realtors take advantage of you for lunch and having you to baby sit their open houses while they have the day off. Btw, you get paid on draw in which you have to pay back or reduce your commissions by your base salary (Commission - base salary = paycheck)

","Poor management selection. Managers (not all but 90%) are rude, pushy, condescending and constantly looking for anything to yell at you about. The Market leader is all of what the 90% of managers are including unprofessional, selfish, unwilling to promote based on skills, promotes unfair and unequal treatment, she WILL lie to you and constantly gives incorrect directives and lazy. Working under her will make you hate your job and eventually your life. If you try to get into a new position, she will block it.
Advice to Management
Be understanding, actually care about your employees not just pay lip service to us, stop acting like you’re better than everyone and stop promoting people solely based off of tenure.

Advice to Management
Most of your employees will work hard and do what is expected without all of the micro-managing. A lot of what you implement adds extra time that takes away from the client. Also, if you are doing MTC as a manager don't come in there like a used car salesman manager and try to resell the products I have already discussed with the client. It looks very poor and shows the true colors of what the bank is trying to accomplish.
