I worked at Phillips 66 full-time
Pros
Great compensation and benefits
Interesting work opportunities. Wide variety of experiences. 
Continuous training available. 
Some parts of the company still honor the companies strong core values.
Cons
Cultural shift underway. 

Moving to more outsourcing and management of contracts and less emphasis on people and career development. 

Current upper management has turned a blind eye towards several ethical violations and increasing attrition (including many key resources) is seen as collateral damage. 

Business strategy transformation is happening but nothing groundbreaking. AE66 has a great marketing campaign but real results are questionable.

Overall the company has both a strong business and people strategy, but leaders are not being held accountable to walk the talk.

Fri Jan 15 2021, Cybersecurity Analyst,"Bartlesville, OK",Current Employee ,"Great benefits, solid comp, some leadership issues",0,"Incredible benefits. 6% 401k match. Company is self-insured thru BCBS, Aetna, or another provider depending on the location you're in. Great HSA or FSA health plan options. Excellent life insurance, long & short-term disability. Vacation days contingent on experience (10/yr if you're fresh out of college, add 5 days for every 5 years of experience). Add in a floating holiday and monthly ""19/30"" days that have to be used within the month. Some teams are excellent and it's entirely possible to have a wonderful set of immediate colleagues & supervisor.
","IT leadership in shambles. CIO resigned, possibly because he was effectively made into a co-CIO with 5 or 6 other senior IT folks. Poor coordination, too many cooks in the kitchen. Lots of other senior or longstanding middle IT managers leaving the company, taking valuable historical knowledge with them. Lack of leadership makes it very difficult to get the ""easy wins"" done, like deploying out-of-the-box updates for standard applications. Stuff that should take 20 min can take 6 months, under the right mix of bad circumstances. 

2021 merit increases have been ""deferred"" indefinitely. Not a shocker considering the state of the industry. Haven't had layoffs to the extent of Exxon, BP, etc., but a few dozen people were let go in late 2020. Most teams in IT are already skeleton crews. Bonuses are expected to be drastically reduced this year, or eliminated entirely; normally they are 10% or more of salary.

Culture very oriented towards physical safety when I joined. That all went out the window when everyone was forced back to the office in May/June 2020. Hard to take the ""Hold the handrail"" rules seriously when mask-wearing is not enforced stringently. Working remotely is not an option for most corporate HQ staffs, even though many can and did work remotely with great success from March-May 2020. Understandably the situation is different at refineries, but those teams are also spread out over larger sites, which can make social distancing easier.

The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.


-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)

-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.


-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn

-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.

-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.
","-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. 

-The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). 


-Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?


-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...

-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". 

-There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.


-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. 


-The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""


-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.


-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".
Advice to Management
Stop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.

","As an experienced hire, new views were not welcomed. The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.
Advice to Management
Be open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo. It would be beneficial if the VP level talked with senior staff directly more to understand some of the dysfunctional problems in the management level between them and senior support staff. They might find out what is working and not working more.

","This company is stuck in the 1960s and refuses to adapt to the times for some reason. With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.

There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.

Sun Oct 27 2019,Anonymous,"Bartlesville, OK",Current Employee ,Good start,1,"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). 

Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. 

Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.
","Limited vacation time (usually 10 days), but the company does have 10 dedicated holidays (Christmas, etc). Also, some jobs are eligible for the ""19/30"" program, which gives you an extra day off each moth so long as you work 8.5 hours per day (instead of 8 - up to you if you'd want to do that in any given month).

","Everything else... play the game of regurgitated catch phrases when management is in earshot, then trash talk them in private and you’ll probably get promoted. Have integrity and you’ll never get recognized. 
On the technical side of things, if you have new ideas you might as well forget them. It’s going to be the way it’s always been because of legacy managers that are holding onto the 1980s and have a closed mind. 
The technicians are supposed to work alone, keep things running by whatever means needed, but have zero technical support. There’s no room for a department in the hierarchy with creative technical minds. If it isn’t pipe fittings and welding they don’t think it matters. In the world we live in now, there are so many wonderful technologies we could enable in our processes but you’ll never see them because of ignorant minds at the top. I heard at one town hall about how they are going to enable “predictive maintenance “ by monitoring machine hours and vibrate monitoring. They talked about it like they just invented it and it’s the best thing ever. It’s last decades technology! But they theoretically patted themselves on the back for discovering a steam engine for crying out loud. It’s frustrating beyond belief. 
This “Digital transformation” they brag about is just another smoke and mirrors show with clever imagery and graphics. They half heartedly designed some apps for an iPad they sent everyone and after a couple years, none of it works worth a flip. They’ll brag about it but it’s an absolute disaster. Most everyone’s iPads are in a desk drawer. 
They also tell you there are all kinds of cool opportunities to be involved in but the thing is once those projects get underway you won’t be allowed to be a part of it because they run staffing so thin they just can’t allow you to go anywhere. It’s a morale busting dead end job with ever increasing responsibilities.
People spend most of the time looking for other jobs on their cell phones. Once I get an offer I’m out.

I worked at Phillips 66 full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Nice people. Great benefits. Overall stable. For those just beginning their career, the internship program is top notch.
Cons
Phillips 66 does not value experience coming in from other companies. You get the feeling they are hiring you because of your knowledge and experience. Later, if you make recommendations that are new or have a viewpoint that differs from the status quo you will get the “That’s not how we do it at Phillips 66” line. It’s exceedingly frustrating. 

Within IT, questionable decisions are made about and by leadership. For example, internally promoting someone into a senior leadership position that has zero experience in that domain.

The individual who runs C&MFS intimidates and turns their nose up to all entry level employees and the controller comes down time to time to thank all the college kids for the hard work put in, but really doesn't know what they do. Overall it is very sad to see such a pool of talent being wasted and turnover will be high in this group for the foreseeable future. Aspirations are crushed in mid-year and year-end discussions that have no impact on an already broken rating system and people are just waiting their turn in line to be rotated. Great company. Terrible group.

Job security is there as long as you are a game player and stay compliant. Plenty of locations across the globe to work i suppose.
","The game playing overshadows all else. The ""legacy"" employees who were with either Conoco or Phillips66 prior to the merge and then split still hold onto their former companies ""values"" and mentalities. This is evident all over the spectrum. the longer you work here and deal with other departments throughout the company you begin to pick up on the divisions and egos. Even after the split in 2012 there are still many area of the process where there are no standards set for process control and it's left up to local operations to come up with something. This would normally be fine, except that a corporate audit will come through and nail you, which doesn't even make any sense. 
 the company operates like a dozen sailboats in a harbor, each sailing without regard for each-other, yet somehow narrowly avoiding collision. If a sailor falls overboard, the blame is found ASAP and someone is roundly sent to the brig in short order. It's a place to make good money and hope maybe you can move up but good luck because the ""career paths"" are not defined, and there's nepotism hurdles to jump over. You try to blow a whistle on an ethics violation? You might as well be back on this website looking for a job at another company because you will are expendable. Seen it happen right in front of my eyes, and this person had a supervisory position. I would never recommend someone work at this company. Planning is scarce on projects, departments fight each-other and are all on defense, all the time. People look over their shoulders constantly, afraid that knife is there to get them. Maybe a few years from now when the ""legacy"" dead wood has all retired then some fresh blood can inject some ideas and energy into this...energy company it's be a place you might enjoy being. But for now, it's still a good-ol-boy(and girl too!) run company because they have been around since the Conoco days and they are trying to hold onto something that doesnt exist anymore. It isn't only men, there's women who are involved in the backstabbing as well in the field. They have been around for 20-30 years also and they have the ear of higher ups that they were once peers with. It's a dangerous situation. Watch your backs.

Pros
Mid-stream and downstream components of the company reduce the cyclical volatility of the company's earnings compared to the rest of the oil & gas sector. Senior leadership are good at running daily operations and strive to be safe and ethical in their dealings.
Cons
Human Resources is and has been broken for many years, a legacy of ConocoPhillips' hierarchical, centralized leadership under the prior CEO (Mulva, named the Worst CEO of the first decade of this century by Business Week magazine). The company lacks intelligent policies for the placement of personnel (cookie cutter, tick-the-box mgmt), there is little succession planning and a lack of delegation of authority that would permit solid leadership to emerge among middle management.

Everyone is willing to offer assistance, even if it does not benefit their job/group. Management focuses on employee development and talent retention, and subsequently invests significant time in the professional growth of individuals, particularly at the entry level. Lastly, there are some brilliant minds at the mid- to executive-level who are major proponents in continuous improvement initiatives.
","While there is a correlation between an employee's passion/excitement and the quality of his/her work, it isn't necessarily a precursor to job performance. Inefficient meetings and poorly planned agendas stem the need for 3+ meetings over the same basic project requirements that should be well-defined before the meeting begins.
Advice to Management
Do not base hires solely on their enthusiasm for the company. Do not be stymied by lengthy rotational or professional development programs; instead, provide new hires with challenging work and high expectations in their current role, and the vision for a potential, future career path.

Sun Mar 15 2015,N/A,, ,Maintaining head count of Phillips 66; but hiring contracted personnel to make up for not enough Phillips 66 personnel.,1,"None concerning head count. It is a false head count.
","Head Count is really false. Hire contracted personnel to do duties that should be Phillips 66. Contracted personnel supervising/overseeing other contractors. Many of these contracted personnel are receiving pay that is so high; it would be less expensive to hire Phillips 66 people. Overall, head count is still too low to do the duties properly; people are burning out and stressed out. This is compounded by the company's habit of placing inexperienced, young personnel in supervisory positions (who only want to supervise and not perform actual work).
Advice to Management
Wake up. This false head count is actually causing increased costs, from not having enough experienced cost/price analysts, to not enough staff to oversee contractors, to not enough engineers with experience to write good Scopes of Work or formulate reasonably accurate independent estimates, to not enough contracting/procurement staff at the facilities. Too much mid-management, layers not needed.

","Our facilities are abysmal, we have older structures with lead paint, sheet metal rusting away and none of it was built before the 1940s. Noone wants to work around that, even for a pipeline company.
With the pay, they have you locked in. So you are subject to their whims when it's decided to mabye change a dozen forms overnight, then they are dumped on you.
Information is sent straight to the employees from upper management via e-mail versus mabye going through lower level leadership. How about giving them (area supervisors) a chance to look like they are in the chain of command. They do not seem to be very valued, which effects morale.
There seems to be a culture of, if something happens that isnt desired, like an equipment failure, or paperwork error, finding out where to point the finger as fast as possible. It's a blame culture instead of a teamwork resolving the issue culture. Lots of people are walking around looking over their shoulder a lot of the time.

","So many challenges. Where to start. For one we are a union facility which has bred a culture of Us vs. Them. Conspiracy theories regarding the company's seemingly nefarious actions towards represented workers makes interpersonal work relationships difficult. New jobs and responsibilities with little on-boarding or training is commonplace. Because the Refinery Leadership Team is constantly changing we struggle with creating a sense of ""self"" or culture. The butt of the joke is the people whom we should respect as the leaders are considered nothing more than ""short-timers"" who have neither a sense of the field nor care about the people who work there every day. On a more personal level, supervisors tend to be micro-managers, possibly because they are trying to prove they are worth their pay. I am constantly being asked to update at least 3 different priority spreadsheets/word documents/databases to track my progress on responsibilites. Meanwhile, real progress is hindered. Do not expect to spend much time at home. Depending on your department you will be on-call all week including weekends about once every 2 months or more frequently. No drinking whatsoever during this time. You might consider this a small sacrifice, but when your group is running lean and you have a social life it can be frustrating. Even during normal work weeks the work/life is a little off. My boss will text me during off hours about trivial things. Again, that is probably not a P66 exclusive issue but it remains a product of the demanding work expectation. We have recently revamped our goal setting process to a more complex system (facepalm) that now asks us to post action items and track progress(again with the tracking!). Overall the P66 mentality is ""if it ain't broke, fix it"". We do not devote nearly as much time to our people as we did as ConocoPhillips.

Seems like a typical big corporation with its politics and culture. The bonuses are great but, combination of that, the profit enhancement program, the rating system, etc., it also deteriorates the team atmosphere. There seems to be a blame/fear culture. I'm sure it is different for different groups. Try to contact someone from LinkedIn and ask about your specific group. Internal turnover is quite high and it seems like a lot of people don't necessarily have control over their next position. The high turnover creates an atmosphere where no one cares to really learn their position so no one knows what's going on.

It depends on what kind of person you are. If you like to play the game and are used to this environment, you can do a lot here. If not, or you're not labeled as ""high potential"" early on, you probably won't move up fast.

 - There are opportunities to move between different junior roles for a couple of years initially, which can be good to find what you enjoy doing.
 - People are friendly and won't bite your head off if you ask for help.
","- There is no credible development plan in place for junior staff. A high proportion of staff are not motivated, and most of those who are high calibre and want to develop end up leaving for development opportunities after a few years.
 - Everything moves at a snails pace (another reason why ambitious staff tend to move on), and even once a decision is made it can take months to get head office approval or budget. It is a VERY corporate/bureaucratic culture.
 - There is no credible plan to deal with the impending decline in petrol/diesel cars, which gives the feeling of a sinking ship. The company is betting on renewable petrol/diesel, which there will not be demand for once petrol/diesel cars are banned in 2030.
 - There is a very outdated approach to flexible working - even in the middle of the pandemic the company started to bring staff back in 5 days a week and only backtracked when it went against government guidance. We will all be back in the office with no wfh at the first opportunity.

","Benefits package has been significantly de-valued in real terms over recent years. Operations shift staffing levels always at minimum, significant amounts of extra hours expected to be worked at the drop of a hat to cover sickness, holidays and training needs due to minimum staffing levels, often making a working week 84 hours of 12 hour shifts , the final 5 (going into 2 days off) being 12 hour nights. Working week is 40 hours, not the usual 37 hr average now recognised by most employers. Square pegs often expected to fit into round holes. Training is often rushed due to low staffing levels, as long as the trainee knows the answer to the question on the competency sheet they are deemed competent to operate a refinery. Staff who say the right thing to the right people are promoted, not the staff with the most experience or ability. The company has a great business philosophy / charter but it is significantly lost and followed less and less the lower you get within the business, shift operations are at the bottom. The new buildings at Humber make a great impact to visitors and staff who work in them but once you go out onto site the environment including offices and welfare facilities are very dated, often filthy and badly maintained. Often told that there are things going on in the background that we do not know about. Union membership discouraged.
Advice to Management
Understand that just because you get a large number of applicants whenever job vacancies are advertised doesn't mean that you are attracting the correct type of staff. Understand that money is only a motivator for a short time, understand that paying people hugely different salaries for doing the same job does not motivate people.

","Management is questionable at best, they just have no clue how to recognise and reward talent. It's one of those places where if you're 'catch of the day' with the boss you're in for that promotion, not because you're the best one for the job. 
Extremely little opportunity for progression unless you're in higher positions or on the graduate scheme.
No autonomy encouraged.
US owned and extremely regulated. Impossible to get any changes though without years of red tape and it going through the States.

Wed Jan 08 2014,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Not a bad company to work for,1,"Worked with the company for about 5 years.

Working safely is emphasized every day and everyone is expected to watch out for themselves and others.

Pay is on par with the rest of the industry with a competitive bonus program, retirement plans, and medical plans.

The work is generally interesting and adds real value to the business unit and the company.

Lots of opportunities to change positions and continue developing as an individual and professional.

Most of the people I've worked with are friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to work together.

The company seems well positioned within the industry. The assets are well diversified; they are located throughout the world and balance each other. When one section of the company underperforms, other sections sustain company performance (i.e. compare the 2013 3rdQ results with the 2012 3rdQ results).

The CEO consistently recognizes the importance of P66 employees. He looks to be leading the company towards future success, even as he praises the current successes. He seems friendly and down-to-earth.

I'm happy and proud to be a part of this organization.
","Unfortunately, there are a lot of unpleasant aspects too.

The company and management emphasize safe work, but don't always address root causes. An investigation team may identify systemic gaps and recommend specific ways to improve, but management will often disproportionately assign responsibility to an individual. This has led to reoccurance of similar incidents and the same facility as well as throughout the company.
Company standards are poorly written (i.e. LOPA) and conflict with the very regulations they are ""based"" on. When senior management is informed of this discrepancy by an 3rd party expert, the response is ""well I'm going to follow the company standard.""
Along those lines, management seems to have more emphasis on meeting metrics than actually doing what's right. The implied message is ""I care more about my career than I do about what's right.""
At the same time, I've always felt safe walking around the facilities I've worked at. It's just a shame the company is so slow to learn from it's mistakes.

Company does not clearly link promotion criteria with performance and managers do not evn know the promotion criteria. There are documented qualifications a salaried employee must meet for promotion (i.e. years of experience, performance history, organizational impact, etc). Managers have regularly misquoted the qualifications. Employees may have exemplary performance, but are not promoted in a timely manner. Some employees have been told ""yes, you meet the criteria but we have a metric to meet so we can't promote you until someone retires or resigns.""
Company generally does not offer alternative work schedules (i.e. 9/80s). Some locations have grandfathered flex schedules, but the rest do not and will not. One of the members on the executive leadership team is blatantly against flex schedules ('you already work >9 hrs per day, but for 5 days a week, so why would I give you a free day off?').
And management wonders why employees leave the company and how to retain talent...it's unfortunate really. Truly, one individual on the executive leadership team sees people as tools who can be worked as hard as he wants without any additional compensation.

Opportunities to change positions exist because of high turnover in the organization. People (particularly those in the 3-10 yr experience range) are leaving the company for competitors that offer better benefits, i.e. higher pay and flex schedules. Management at facilities with high turnover refuse to let employees relocate because the facility already can't retain employees. Those employees then leave the company.
Headcount is definitely an issue. The staffing levels at many facilities are significantly lower than the levels at similar companies. When people leave P66, they generally go to those other companies.
Development is almost entirely self-driven. The company offers very little formal training to help employees grow. At least the company is changing that. New training programs have already been implemented and more are being developed.

The company really is a decent place to work. If management paid less attention to their careers and more attention to making improvements, the company consistently and clearly linked promotion and performance, and implement flex schedules, P66 would be an outstanding place to work.
