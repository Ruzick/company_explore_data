","Cronyism and nepotism are rampant. The leadership is weak and stingy. There are NO policies that would protect employees from unscrupulous management. No trust in nor regard for employees that I could see and I was there for several years. The starting pay is high for the area but below their competitors so the best talent goes elsewhere. Raises are small for the average employee so if you accept a position here I would recommend negotiating the highest starting wage possible, get a few years of experience in the industry, and get out. Several departments have this kind of revolving door with a 1-2 year turnaround. Money seems to be the only thing management cares about, and they make lots of it, but it does NOT trickle very far down from the top.

","Since July, it’s 100% back in the office with zero allowance for work from home. See other reviews about old school culture, that’s coming back in the form of the company actively opposing any accommodation for work from home, even if you have kids in virtual schooling. Masks are required at all times in the office (good) but other than that they’re pretending it’s business as usual. 

Management stresses “personal responsibility” and not coming to work if sick at all, but it costs vacation time if you call in sick. The incentives and the message don’t line up.

Mon Mar 19 2018,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Bad Management Good People,1,"- The People - One of the best aspects of working at Enterprise was the people you interact with on a daily basis. The majority of the ""worker"" level people are smart, capable and friendly.
- The Assets - Enterprise has a lot of assets that are well integrated and well run by the Operations team. This makes it much easier to do your job as a member of the team at the corporate office.
- Bonuses - Once you get into the bonus pool, the LTIP and STIP are both very competitive.
","- Management - From the VP level to Senior Management, there is a lot of incompetence and arrogance. The management team overall treats the employees of the company very poorly. They push them to work more hours and get more and more work done, but there's no appreciation for the dedication. Employees are regularly scolded or reminded that they are replaceable.
- Lack of upward mobility - There is very high turnover at Enterprise, so you would think this would result in a lot of merit based promotions, but that's not the case. Promotions are regularly given based on who you are friends with rather than the work you're doing. This creates discord among the employees and puts unqualified personnel in power positions.

YES, sometimes management is hard on you. YES, there are communications breakdowns across groups...blah blah blah. But let's get real, what major corporation doesn't have these issues?? You adapt and overcome and get on with it...Here's what I will say about my experience with Enterprise (and yes, I realize that there could be [read: are] others having wildly different experiences based on location, direct management, position, et al); in my experience if you show up hungry every day, work hard, learn something, and stay focused you will advance and you will be compensated for it. It sounds overly cliché, but it's not. I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency. The culture of Enterprise is such that actual hard work, team-building and dedication will be rewarded, and nay-saying, laziness and complacency will stick out like a sore thumb. Cliché or not, that's what I've experienced, and there's my two cents.

","I’ve read some of the reviews and I agree with several comments. There is a lack of consistency for internal processes in some of the departments, as well as, a lack of communication. The company is trying to address these areas of improvement like many other companies. Sadly, there are many underqualified, poor performing, and underperforming employees in the company that are getting compensated for trying to “look busy” in a slow market. These employees are taking advantage of the situation. The company needs to trim the fat. The high performers even in a slow market continue to outshine these individuals; it’s easier to “see” who needs to be cut and it’s time to take care of business in our cost-savings environment.
Advice to Management
Overall, it’s a good company with a clear vision. Advice to management: look at internal process and streamline procedures. The company needs to take advantage of the market by trimming the fat, updating work processes, and cutting work flow redundancies. Continue to mentor strong performers and listen to their suggestions, so when the market picks back up we are not behind our competitors. This is a great time to cross train employees, continue to brand the company name, keep your high performers engaged, and spend more money on educating our employees in a slow-moving market.

Secondly, it's also true that the company fails to take corrective action when it comes to low, under performing or poor performing employees (which is nice for the under performing employee - but not for their colleagues. It makes for a frustrating work environment.

Thirdly, there are several unwritten policies regarding position titles, how/when people get promoted or can transfer positions, etc. and each business unit seems to have it's own policies. It's very ambiguous and makes it hard for the employee who desires to grow with the company to be able to set career growth goals.
