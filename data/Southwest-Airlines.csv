Terrible pay at $13/hr
Incredibly unorganized environment. Throughout my time there I worked with over 10 supervisors and five different managers. Each of them wanted things to be done a different way, so with each person you worked with you had to do things differently, or else get talked down to. This is a very senior, all white, work force, and they do not like the presence of a newer, younger employee being there, so they do their best to degrade them and find every reason to tell them ""you are new so you really need to be careful,"" ""you are new and we can fire you at any moment,"" constantly to boost their own egos. The management doesn't care at all to help you, and they want to see you be unsuccessful. This is not Herb Kelleher's Southwest at all, and definitely not the ""fun loving"" culture they keep claiming they have.

I have been working at Southwest Airlines full-time
Pros
Amazing people, benefits, and culture. I feel genuinely cared for as a person, and I love what we do and stand for.
Cons
Some truly great leaders here, but definitely too many poor ones who either pursue their own agenda rather than the good of all, or who have deficient knowledge of how things really work (even in their own disciplines) but arrogantly think they know better. 

That said, I believe in what we do, and the good of the company far outweigh the bad.
Advice to Management
At some point, you are going to have to come to grips that we do have some leadership issues at senior and mid levels, and you HAVE the talent within the company who know how to fix it (we over rely on prof services in many ways...but then again, we also under rely on them when they tell us the way things ought to be particularly from a back office perspective - we have got to learn the difference between the two). Find the people whose voices are sound, but go unheard because of filtering of leadership at mid and senior levels.

Holistically, they care about their customers, their people, and their social impact. I cannot say better things about the fun-loving environment or the executive leadership.
","The Marketing department has some severe political, discrepancy, and leadership issues. The mid-level management is out-of-touch, apathetic, and selfish.

Advice to Management
Reflect your executives and be transparent. There is nothing more valuable to an employee than transparency. Remember that your success is measured by those who work for you.

Can only speak to the station I worked for, but there was literally only one ramp supervisor who was there for the 4 years I worked as a ramp agent. Either they don't get paid enough, the job is too stressful, or both. This lead to under-qualified people being put into positions as supervisors without understanding the fundamentals of the job. Often times they were lazy and unwilling to help, but jumped at the chance to write you up for delays. Overall it can be a good place to work if you are someone who is simply looking to clock in, do your job, and enjoy the benefits. Just be prepared for the clique culture, favoritism, and ever changing safety regulations that are too often miscommunicated.

Tue Aug 18 2020,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Technology is the most dysfunctional organization at SWA. Lack of innovation and terrible and unethical Leadership.,2,"Good benefits. Job security. Great 401k and flight benefits. CEO is fantastic!
","Horrible micromanagement. Lack of forward thinking and does not promote thought leadership. Innovation is stifling. Mostly legacy systems with no real push for anything beyond mediocrity. Senior Leaders and Middle Management have extremely poor execution. The old famous culture that Herb built, is quickly becoming diluted by new outside Leadership that does not for core values. The organization is run by a “ghost” CIO, whom takes very good care of her friends. 

I’ve personally witnessed many unethical and toxic traits by Leadership. They do not value ideas or new technology, they’re extremely behind in the times and have zero willingness to adapt. The company is ran by an “old school buddy system” and lacks a real vision. None of the Leadership have any technical expertise or acumen and have zero emphasis on uplifting skills or helping employees grow. They pride themselves on accountability and “servant leadership”, but actions prove otherwise. Work is not stimulating and it’s the most passive aggressive enviornment I have seen in my career. If you want to explore SWA, I believe there are great Leaders and People in operations, crew, and other business support area - but technology is an absolute mess.
Advice to Management
Need some serious investigation into the toxic behaviors and poor Leadership within Technology. Especially, at the Director, VP and CIO level. I have first hand encountered and witnessed very toxic, and unethical behavior and treatment of employees and peers on multiple occasions. The new Leaders they’re bringing in will surely kill whatever culture is left. They’re forcing top employees out right now through COVID-19 loop holes after taking government bail out money. I’ve witnessed not only Kathleen, but several other senior VP’s act and behave in ways that would have them escorted out of the company anywhere else. I personally was verbally abused on many occasions and treated incredibly unfair and asked to do unethical things that I could just not bring myself to do because of my servant leadership traits and my moral compass. Gary and Tom really need to look into rooting out the “buddy system” at the top and bring in some fresh new Leadership if they want to see Technology survive. Every one of my internal customers feel the same way about Technology. After the constant verbal abuse, nepotism, and lack of accountability - I decided to resign. I truly hope someone takes this feedback seriously. Just ask Charlie Feld how he feels. He will give you some real candid feedback.

","Ridiculously low pay for first five years (starting pay, first year $14.53/hr for CSAs; $.03 raise on second year). You either have to have a second job or a wealthy spouse &/or retirement fund in order to make ends meet financially. Must join union after hiring on (but very little union representation until you have completed 7 mo probation; and even then it feels like an ongoing struggle between management and union). If you need time off or are sick and you don't have vacation/sick time to draw from (and you won't for approx first six months) it's on you to trade, give away or pay a coworker to take your shift. If you refuse mandatory overtime, you receive ""points and occurrences"" which can potentially affect your ability for future promotions. For all the ""LUV"" and hospitality SWA expects you to show the flying public, they could stand to improve on how they treat their employees. Turnover rate is HIGH during the first year.

Do you know how many employees sleep in their cars between shifts (even during very cold weather) because they can't afford to turn down mandatory overtime?

","I've been out of there less than two years and I finally have my self esteem back. 

It felt like I was in an abusive relationship, now that I look back on it. It was friendly and smiling, popular, charming. My hiring manager told me all the things that they were excited to have me bring to the table. 

I got evaluations from my management with this feedback: ""Don't ask questions"" ""Don't talk so directly."" After pointing out a flawed logic saying, ""my argument is"" I was angrily interrupted by ""it's not an argument.""

I've seen two women in upper management suddenly retire from working to raise their kids when they were in the middle of their careers. 

There are managers that have been filling a desk for a decade or more. 

I have a lot of stories that seem unbelievable compared to their image. They spend years making decisions because no one wants to take responsibility if something doesn't work. People don't grow in skills and if you do, they aren't paying for it. They don't pay market rate if you aren't in a union. Flying free is stressful for even one person and much more so trying to take anyone with you. 

The casual dress code is a way to distinguish those who have any power and those that don't. 

The jobs you had before are ""prior life"" and not your professional experience. 

Just know that this is not where you get professional success. 

It feels like daycare in different ways. One week you're complaining about the sick kids in conference rooms and the next you're having to ask your boss, repeatedly, to not startle you on purpose. 

My favorite story, my boss is telling me about his last meeting; ""she just comes in with all this high energy and big words. I mean, she bloviates all over the place""... as he said, bloviating all over the place, ""she reminds me a lot like you. ""

Tue Jan 07 2020, Customer Service Agent,,Former Employee ,Are you a vampire?,10,"I came to Southwest with so much excitement and so much respect. Finally, a company I could work for that had a reputation for treating it's employees great. When I went in for my interview I let them know my greatest asset was my positive attitude and that I would work very hard for them if hired. Everything leading up to training in Dallas was perfect. They flew us to a People department and overwhelmed us with love, letting us know how fortunate we were to work for such a great company while explaining our benefits. Amidst the glow, individual contracts were set out in front of us, with the base pay and the union who had negotiated it. I couldn't have felt more proud of myself for landing this job. I then returned to the station where I trained for about a month with someone, after which I went to the training headquarters in Dallas for three weeks of paid training. All the moments I spent there were wonderful. There was free coffee everywhere, and they put us up in a nice hotel and gave us food cards. It was heaven, and again I felt lucky and so proud to work for Southwest Airlines. I cannot express how great the Corporate culture is. The benefits you receive, as well as the welcome you get, are the main and only highlights of this job. However, once you return from Dallas, the reality sets in: something is not as it seems. This really is too good to be true.
","A week after I returned from Dallas, I had completed my training and finally began a probationary period of 6 months. During this time you begin your union contract and bid for a shift. Per the contract: Southwest employees cannot decline mandatory overtime, call in sick, or come to work late. If you do, you receive an occurrence. Three occurrences and you are terminated. During this time it became perfectly clear that I was an employee number. Nothing more. 60 hour weeks were commonplace.
Imagine: Your shift is Wednesday through Sunday 3pm - 11:30pm. On Wednesday you work your regular shift, but clock out late due to delays: 3pm - 1:30am (10 hours). However, you are assigned mandatory overtime (remember you cannot decline this without being fired) for 2 hours after you get off at 3:45am - 11:45am. You then work from 3pm - 11:30pm the same day. Imagine that this happens 2 times a week, every week. That is the reality of Southwest Airlines. Throughout my probationary period this was VERY common, and again happened at least 2 times a week. The most I had to work was 81 hours in one week, four 16 hour shifts back to back, and then a regular 8 hour shift on one of my days off. It's not the type of work that is the problem, it is the amount of work.
Upon asking union leaders and management, their responses were, and I quote VERBATIM: If you don't like it, maybe this job isn't for you. Once completing your probationary period, which is rare as people literally fall asleep on the job and are fired, or break down from the mental stress of staying awake for 2 days straight, you can decline the overtime. Even then, 16 hour days are a common occurrence, as is mandatory overtime. The IAM union contract states that for every refusal of mandatory overtime, you accrue half a point (.5). If you accrue 9 points, you are subject to termination. In the single month after my probation I accrued 5 points by simply declining overtime. Per the contract, it takes 3 months for just 2 points to drop from your record, during which time you cannot be late, call in sick without a doctors note, or decline ANY overtime. As it stands, my weeks are never less than 50 hours. NEVER.
This amount of work results in huge employee burnout. I recently spoke with someone at Headquarters in Dallas who said, ""Right now we have a high turnover rate for customer service and we are trying to figure out why.""

I cannot in good conscious recommend this job to anyone that values their sanity.
Advice to Management
Stop overworking your employees. This amount of work results in huge employee burnout. People who work hard with a positive attitude are being fired for coming in to work 15 minutes late after working 32 hours in 2 days. To me, this signals a lack of compassion from a company which prides itself on being the LUV airline. I recently spoke with someone at Headquarters in Dallas who said, ""Right now we have a high turnover rate for customer service and we are trying to figure out why.""
My advice is simple: change the wording of the union contract and the probationary period to allow more new hires to enter the company. The amount of overtime stems from inadequate staffing, which is caused by mandatory overtime. It's a vicious cycle and it will continue so long as the terms of the union contract and probationary period go unchanged. Some of the employees that have been fired I have seen go straight to another airline. Southwest needs to fix this in order to survive, or it will find itself becoming more and more short staffed.

We use a hodge podge of outdated and ineffective programs, making this job infinitely harder than it should be.

Also you will be the first to get mandatory overtime. It can be difficult to schedule things sometimes.

They hire according to your high level of customer service, versus other airlines I've witnessed hire young & cute but not helpful or friendly. or nice. If you have a bad attitude or don't want to provide excellent customer service, this is the wrong company for you. I've worked at 2 other airlines and Southwest is exceptional in treating customers and employees as a high priority. Southwest is not a perfect company but they try. If you have perfect attendance all year, you will receive a $1000. If you have perfect attendance from July to July you receive 2 extra paid holidays. The supervisors and managers thank you for coming in and being at work, there's hugging involved, they show appreciation. You are empowered to help passengers versus other airlines you get in trouble for helping passengers. Flight benefits enable me to fly every month which I ordinarily would not be doing. There's alot of schedule trading with fellow employees, which enables me to have 3 days off every week. I've noticed that many people started young and decided to stay with the company and they are very happy about their career choice.

Upper management, team lead don't care enough about the employees to make sure they are okay. It's all about the numbers. You may have gotten numerous Customer Compliments and a Letter of Commendation. You may have always been reliable, dependable, have excellent attendance and performance reviews, but if they think you did something wrong on the phone none of that matters. They don't go through a process of trying to find out if something has happened to you or if you're okay. You as a employee do not really matter. Which really shows the true nature of Southwest Airlines. Truly a surprising disappointment.

Fri Jun 21 2019, Ramp Agent,"Nashville, TN",Former Employee ,It's not what they make it to be.,12,"You can be a millionaire if you put your time in. Great flight and health benefits, matching 401k, and opportunities to work up.
","This is a long review, but I hope you take the time to read it. I began my interest in the airline industry as young as 8 years old. I'm actually an aspiring airline pilot in flight school. I guess you could consider me a Southwest ""Super-Fan."" I truly love the company, and what it was founded upon. In my high school marketing classes, I did many projects on the SWA model, and Herb Kelleher. When I became of age, I actually began my airline career at the other Dallas based airline as a ramp agent. The life there wasn't always glamorous, but I learned a lot, had fun, and earned the respect of management. Loved the atmosphere, but my heart and passion was always at Southwest. It's where I wanted to start, but they weren't hiring in Nashville for the longest time. After 8 months at my other airline, Southwest finally had a Ramp Agent position opening in BNA. I gladly applied, and was a full time employee within a month. The training process was lengthy, but helpful. I caught on quickly as I had prior ramp experience. All new hires are flown to Dallas, TX for a week of classroom training. I had my own hotel room, prepaid card for food, and was welcomed to an inviting culture. My new hire class consisted of 5 ramp agents. We spent a week there, and came back to Nashville for a few weeks to wrap up OJT. I picked up my bid on the ramp, and was finally on my way. Life on the ramp isn't always ideal. You can face terrible weather, extended hours due to delayed flights, short staffing, physical and demanding work, it all may have a personality change on you. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of great days as well. You may only work 3-4 flights in a full time shift. You'll have a great, helpful crew on your gate, on-time flights, sunny at 80 degrees weather, and even a few smiles from your managers. Unfortunately, I didn't have too many great days at Southwest. 99% of new hire ramp agents in Nashville are assigned to a night/closing shift. To many, it's probably the worst shift to have. I personally believe they purposely give this shift to new hires to see if they have what it takes. A typical closing shift is 5pm-1:30AM with Tuesday and Wednesday off. Of course when you gain more seniority, you'll be able to pick a more ideal shift, with hours and days off that suit you best. The night shift in Nashville was terrible. I wish I could have started off on mornings. There is a huge difference between the morning and night shift in BNA. Mornings have the likable managers, better co-workers, and the ability to the enjoy the rest of your day when you clock out. Everyone has their preferences, but I personally would have liked to clock out at noon, and spend my time with friends and family in the evenings. Night shift in Nashville wasn't ideal. Management was never in a good mood, and always was looking to nail someone for some type of violation. Managers love being petty. There were plenty of great workers written up for very questionable reasons. This is where the union dues are worth it. Sadly, when you're on the 6 month probation, you are not protected by the union. No matter if you work days or nights, be on your best behavior, show up on time, and don't question anything at Southwest. Trust no one. It's every man for himself. Coming from another airline with ramp experience, I can personally say a lot of the ramp procedures at Southwest are ridiculous. Tail Stands? Bin Shields? It's 2019, and they're still using a ton of paper. They may seem like little things, but it's just another thing that I found unnecessary that could cause damage or injury. They just added strain to the job. If you are committed to nothing but working, and don't wanna see your family, Southwest is a fantastic place to work. I am not being sarcastic. The overtime is double pay, and allowed me to bring home some nice paychecks. I was always willing to help a co-worker if they needed a shift covered. However, I did miss a lot of personal events, and was bothered by that. It happens often in the airline industry. The mandatory over-time can be crazy, as you could work 19 hours, and then be expected to be back at the airport within 5 hours. I knew many guys who set up mattresses in their cars, or in the break room. The Mandatory over time will screw you a good amount of times. Like I said, it's great money, but you no longer have a personal life. Your kid could be in the hospital dying, but they don't care. You better show up to work. The probation period is rough on the ramp. Management is watching you like a hawk, and I hope you have a strong immune system as well. You honestly don't have room to be sick during this period. They'll hire someone who doesn't get sick. You have 3 strikes in probation. Just be careful, show up early, remain healthy, don't complain, and you'll do just fine. Have the flu? That's too bad. May seem much and unrealistic to some people, but welcome to Southwest. The culture aspect is what Southwest advertises on. That culture is no longer there. Southwest is trying to be like every other airline. They've been successful for nearly 50 years; because they were different. There is no family bond, most employees complain constantly if anything. I had more fun at my other airline honestly. Southwest used to have a game room in Nashville, but they got rid of that course. Rampers used to play basketball during down time, but that was taken away as well. Nashville's station manager was never seen. I don't think he knows more than 20 names. BNA is a top 10 station for Southwest, and it seems poorly ran to me. Working for Southwest was not some life changing experience like they make it seem to be. Managers and the not ideal shifts made me leave Southwest. You could say me not liking the shifts given to someone with little seniority is on me, but I never planned to make a career out of the ramp. At my other airline, they were quite flexible with picking a shift, and when you needed a day off, it wasn't a huge deal. Call out at Southwest, and it seems like you're on the hit list from management. Ramp managers in BNA, more specifically during nights, were lacking leadership skills. Never felt appreciated, and you were almost afraid to talk to them because they'd either extend you, or have you do some ridiculous task. I touched on it earlier, but the management is seriously out to get you. Especially on probation. Don't annoy them, and do as you are told. Some senior guys have lost their jobs because they got under the skin of a supervisor. They don't mind terminating someone with seniority so they can bring some new guy in, and pay him less. It is not a laid back atmosphere at Southwest. From unions, to uptight management, it can get pretty interesting. I'm curious how things are at smaller stations, but the experience in Nashville was not what Southwest was originally about. Southwest is slowly but surely becoming like every other airline, and viewing employees as just numbers, and not great people who have made their company successful. If you are wanting to make a career out of the ramp, Southwest is a good place to be. Put your time in, suffer through the terrible shifts early on, earn respect from managers, don't complain, and you'll make a good life for yourself. The benefits are good, and you can't go wrong with the top out pay. After 10 years, you can make nearly 40 dollars and hour as a ramp agent. Not bad for just slinging some bags around. Take that, and the double pay over-time, you can retire by 40. If I didn't want to be a pilot, I would have put my time in at Southwest and worked my way up. It's just the crazy schedule at SWA didn't even allow me to build hours as a student pilot. Take the fact that the shifts Southwest had took me away from my social life was not ideal either. If I had put my time in, gained seniority that would allow me better shifts, things like social life wouldn't have been as big of an issue. There are guys who have been there 10 years with weekends off, top out pay, regular 9-5 hours, living well at Southwest. It was just a rocky road to get to that point for those folks. That's why I have emphasized, if you put your time in, it's a great job. It beats many other professions if you ask me. Southwest is experiencing a culture change, and growing pains. I found it annoying how Southwest tried to hide it's flaws with all these false narratives like its a fun place to work, when the atmosphere is like everyone's else. It's all nonsense. Don't drink the Kool-Aid! Southwest isn't all that. Despite some of the issues I had here, I wish I could have stuck around. I know times change, but I truly have a passion for the company. I was just disappointed how things really were at this company. There are good people at Southwest. It's just I wasn't committed to working terrible hours, dealing with up-tight management and policies that I found a bit extreme. I recently returned to my previous airline which suits my situation the best. I have my beloved morning shift right out hire, weekends off, and a much more laid back atmosphere. I'm glad to be back. I took a pay, and benefit cut, but it was worth it for this aspiring airline pilot. I'll be off the ramp soon enough.

","Where do I start? I am OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID. I was forced to clean blood and feces from the lavatory floor. I was humiliated by my pilot team and other flight attendants just because I was more junior than they wore. I contracted hepatitis B from the blood to skin contact and have been sick every since. SWA has given me no answers and I am at my wits end!

Besides me contracting hepatitis B (which I am currently filing suit) they will hire ANYONE with no prior experience to become a trainer. The course lacks structure and they cram everything into your head within 4 weeks and will run something by you 1 time and expect you to demonstrate it to perfection. The trainers do not know how to teach the material because they are new flight attendants trying their best to teach NOT trainers . Everyone is very rude from upper management to inflight. It is literally everybody vs everybody, pilots vs pilots. FA’s vs FA’s. FA’s vs the union. EVERYONE IS MISERABLE HERE! They will look for any reason to get rid of you. SO IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN A STRESSFUL DRAMA FILLED ENVIRONMENT Go ahead and apply. When you are on reserve they will barely call You for any flights. So technically you will not be making any money until you get a line which can take a year or more. Everything about this experience was very stressful and unprofessional.

Fri Jun 14 2019, Ramp Agent,,Former Employee ,"Great Company, Poor Ground Operation",3,"Medical Benefits, 401k, and the vast resources Southwest gives to help it's people grow their careers in the company.
","Among the large airlines, Southwest runs the most unsafe and technologically insufficient Ground Operation in the industry. Ramp Agents can be forced, through company mandated overtime or voluntary, to work well over a 16 hour double, into working more than 24 hours continuously. I've heard about people working more than that. This is worsened by the fact that the standard number of flights an agent works in one shift is between 6 to 8. Well above the workloads of other airlines, and the OJI's prove it. The culture displayed at Headquarters does not extend to their Ground Operation, in most cases. 

The safety of the worker is clearly not a priority. While the higher workload reduces costs for the company and increases profit sharing, FAA and Ground Ops Manual procedures are consistently violated at all levels.

It's so bad now that Junior leadership (Supervisors), have to be hired off of the street with no prior experience. This even includes their Emerging Leadership Program.

Southwest is the only Airline which makes its employees pay for parking.

-Free flights are by the far the best part of working here. You can go somewhere new every weekend. 
-Short hours are awesome. You can usually get your work done in an hour and management doesn't notice or care if you work 6 hour days. 
-It's very easy to stand out if you know your stuff
","-Red tape is very annoying. They have arbitrary experience requirements for promotions which leads to less deserving/lower performing people being promoted over those with less experience.
-The only negative of free flights is that SWA lacks some of the desired international destinations that other carriers have and flying out of Love Field can be tricky because it's not a true ""hub"" like other airlines have
-Very low base pay compared to other industries. Like, comically low. 
-No negative feedback is ever provided so everyone thinks they're doing great when they're not. No room to grow when everything is sunshine and rainbows all the time.
-Extremely uncompetitive. I know people that have been told ""we can't promote you yet because other people will wonder why you did and they didn't""

They tell you when you take your breaks, lunch and bathroom breaks basically. Was hired to do one job and then after every other month, got more and more responsibilities and no pay increase. Asked if they prefer quality over quantity and after I asked that question in a meeting I was labeled as an employee with a bad attitude. Basically worked with a lot of uneducated catty women. Job was not for me. If you are young or have health problems then this may be your dream job, but if you are educated and can make informed decisions then this job is not for you.

Quality over quantity and stop pushing for time limits to sell credit cards and other items. There would be less re-work if your CSR's would pay attention and listen, but they can't because there is a talk-time. But if your number one goal is to be the most profitable, then I guess it is what it is. I know this is not going to change and hire people that are really qualified and stop promoting by matriculation, some of those folks are dumb as a rock, and you know it. If you have an educator working there as a CSR why get someone that is horrible and just been a CSR forever to train, their delivery is HORRIBLE. You have people there that you can utilize that are well trained to be a trainer. Nooooo......you rather be wasteful. The top 3 waste of Southwest are 1) Talent, 2) Re-work, and 3) Waiting.

- Fun to work at an airport. 


I think Southwest is probably as great as they say, provided that you join any organization other than Technology.
","I want to be respectful in stating the cons, but I also need to be honest. The fact is I've never been this frustrated at a job before. The worst offenders, in my view:

- Poor infrastructure, sometimes down/unreliable or giving unpredictable results. 

- Rule by fear mgmt culture that attempts to increase productivity from technical teams by pushing people harder instead of, you know, fixing problems and addressing resource allocation issues. 

- Heavily silo'd access, meaning you will be heavily dependent upon other teams to help you do everything from A to Z. 

- Attempting to run ""agile"" software delivery on top of support tasks with days-long fulfillment periods. 

- Heavy reliance on cheaper/commoditized labor that, in my experience, only completes requests correctly maybe 70% of the time. 

- Heavy process, generally speaking, but relatively poor documentation to accompany it, requiring everyone including tech staff to spend tons of time in meetings.

Tue Mar 05 2019,Anonymous,"Dallas, TX",Current Employee ,Disaapointing,13,"-SWA does a great job in cultivating a positive culture. It's so competitive to get in, which lets them choose great people. Unfortunately, what is good about the company as a whole doesn't guarantee you're going to get that in your individual department. 
-Great benefits
-Lots of fun activities, from friendly holiday competitions to weekly deck parties
-Many opportunities for feedback - they don't act on it, but hey, at least they listen
-Great communication from upper management about company priorities and initiatives
","-The senior employees (not management) rule the roost. The company puts a huge honor on those who have worked here 10+ years, and they know it. They set the rules, and you'd better get out of their way.
-Advancement is difficult. Again, based on the amount of time you've deposited in the company, not at all on your performance.
-Technology is laughably outdated. The company's actively working to improve this, but their slow, disorganized, and honestly downright rude Technology department is not speeding the process up.
-Pay is below average. They make up for it with great benefits, but it's good to know going in.

Sat Mar 02 2019, Source of Support Representative,"Dallas, TX",Current Employee ,One of worst departments at the company,4,"There are alot of good departments to work for in this company, SOS is not one of them. Travel benefits and company events and entertainment are about the only pro's with working in this specific department. But you don't have even close to the level of flexibility in requesting time off as other departments do. So you barely enjoy travel perks.
","Specifically to the SOS department, they force you to adhere to overly restrictive work policies that don't exist in other departments. Management is clickish and show bias to their favorites. When you try to apply for new positions in other departments to get out of the wreck hole, management blocks it in their review if your not one of their favorites. They enforce policies different with different people. Most of the company has some flexibility in the work, able to go to the restroom when they need, or get water or food, or even take time off. Not SOS. You have 30 min schedule breaks. You can't go to the restroom when you need or you could get penalized. Your only allowed one 30 min lunch break and two 15 min breaks your entire 8 hour shift. So if you need to go to restroom or get water outside of that, you get penalized. You can never volunteer for company events or committees because this department doesn't allow you the flexibility in your schedule to participate during work hours. Although every other department has employees volunteering during work hours. They really make it hard to be part of this fun-luving culture they talk so much about.. If you want to work at Southwest DO NOT work in SOS.

I have been working at Southwest Airlines full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Good pay rates if you can stick it out for a few years. It starts on the low side, but after the five year mark you start to make a decent wage. Currently tops out at about $32 per hour, which is good for an entry level job with no prerequisites. 

Benefits are good. Health, Vision and Dental coverage. Free flights on standby. They have a point based system where you can purchase gift cards and other goods for having perfect attendance which is awarded monthly. 

Good values for a company that is ultimately out to make a profit. Stable, good set of ethics, have not seen any layoffs in the 4 1/2 years I've worked. 

Very physical job. If you like working outdoors and keeping active, this is a great option.

Strong Union. Probably one of the strongest I've worked with. Pretty good at negotiating contracts, and they are good at keeping people from getting screwed over by a supervisor with a chip on their shoulder. I've seen lots of folks who were fired for whatever reason get their jobs back, and they tend to give good advice when you aren't sure of a policy.
Cons
Very physically demanding. If you aren't in shape, or have issues with health, this might not be for you. You'll stacking bags in a bin, on your knees, trying to move bags that can way up to 99 pounds and freight that can get up to 200+.

You're subject to whatever weather comes your way. Where I work, we get everything from rain, to high wind, to severe storms, to snow. Temperatures can get to either extreme from -20 to 105+, and the conditions of the ramp go anywhere from a sheet of ice to being like standing on an oven. Consider the weather in your area and ask yourself if you can handle working in those conditions daily.

Seniority based, with many stations having staff that have been around for 15+ years. Depending on the station, some of the smaller ones will undoubtedly be hard to get the hours you want. On top of that, mandatory OT is issued by seniority starting at the bottom, so if you wind up in a very senior station, expect to get hit up very frequently with forced overtime.

While the Management at headquarters generally have good values, this does not quite apply to the management of the station you work at. Expect to see the same things you would see in most jobs, with supervisors that just hate you and hate the world, and administration that is just plain incompetent from time to time. Many of the supervisor staff come off the streets directly into their job and have no experience in actual ramp activities. There is a very strong Us vs. Them mentality, at least in my station.

Monthly bids for your weekly schedule occur every month or bi-monthly, depending on your station. All of it is done through paper. Have to plan your vacations around it to ensure you don't miss the week a bid rolls out, or have a bid on file that you know you can hold.
Advice to Management
There are a lot of good things here, but there are also a lot of bad things. By far, the biggest issue doesn't come from the work itself, but how the separate stations are managed. There are a lot of values that are preached by Headquarters, but never followed through with by local management. I would suggest reminding the management that those values are what have made us so successful in the past.

As for anyone trying to get a job on the ramp, I advise you to take an honest, critical look at your own situation. This is absolutely a long-term investment of your time, that only really improves when you have the years under your belt. On top of that, ask yourself if you are fit enough or have the drive to become fit enough to perform the tasks. The job itself will kick and beat you into shape, but you need the determination to power through it. And lastly, ask yourself if you can deal with Mother Nature's bulls**t on a daily basis. You'll be out in both the best and worst of it.

- High 401K matching
- Profit Sharing
","- LOW base pay compared to any company out there.
- Little to no diversity in the company, especially in upper management. Look at all Directors and above at SWA. Only 10% would be minorities. 
- Lots of DRAMA - Feels like high school sometimes, but worse.
- Racial FAVORITISM is very evident. Opportunities given to favorites in the team. 
- Career path and criteria for promotion constantly changing and most times not even followed.
- You need to brown nose and kiss up to managers to get promoted. 
- SWA only wants conservative, bubbly, outgoing employees. Quiet ones will be pushed to the corner. 
- Full flights nowadays, so hard to non-rev. Not worth the hassle.

","Very low salary, very limited intl travel, no first class, Expensive parking at LAX, Management can make mistakes that lead to your dismissal unless you keep records
Example: one person was nearly fired twice because admin was one day off on attendance. Luckily, employee had good records. Why work for an airline that does not offer you first class when available? Or international travel to distant lands. If you want a free trip to Omaha, this is your airline.
Advice to Management
Be more clear about insurance coverage. Ensure middle management is doing its job instead of having front line staff suffer over their mistakes. Look for ways to assist agent with parking at LAX. Look at other corporations that do a lot more for employees. You expect a lot for 14.25/ hour at LAX. I am sure you are losing a lot of money as you are constantly trying to hire good, new people. Have an exit interview with those leaving. Try and find out what the problem is and then try to fix it. Face it, if you were such a great place to work, would you be experiencing such a drain?

Backstabbing colleagues who write bad feedback to get rid of new hires with the intent of having more lines for themselves - seriously
","Peer Reviews on Probabtion - one of my peer reviews included false accusations. Because I was new and on probation, it was my word against the more senior flight attendant who swore I was doing an outstanding job and then proceeded to write a report full of false statements of my work ethic, nevermind that all my other reviews were outstanding. I was terminated on the basis of that.
Advice to Management
Do away with peer reviews - it’s an abusive system, stop allowing senior FAs to bully new hires into submission on trips, find a common ground that transfers from the training center to the base management - new hires sometimes receive conflicting information between the two. Also stop pretending to be the LUV company and then terminating people for the slightest misstep without the opportunity to appeal or at least be given an opportunity to show why they are still worthy of being an SWA employee. You saw something in us when you hired us, a mistake is not a lesson not learned.

","Southwest is a great place, and that's why so many people want to work there. They turn away thousands of applicants every day. The acceptance rate is very low. However, Southwest is still a business. As much as they want to put their people first, they have to make business-savvy decisions, and sometimes that comes at a cost. You might wait forever trying to get in, whether you're just applying or whether you're a contractor. 

It's also a large company that can be rather traditional. Management is slow to change policies and procedures. That can be very difficult for the younger part of the workforce, which wants to bring in new ideas from external sources.

Inspiring CEO
From a customer perspective, they always do the right thing and go above and beyond
","Tenure valued over competency
Hired for “fun loving attitude” over ability to do the job/be a top performer 
Underperforming senior leaders are not held accountable 
Critical feedback goes seemingly unnoticed and unactioned 
Typical to have 3-4 Directors per year 
Senior Leaders are treated as generalists and given responsibility in areas for which they are unqualified and often disinterested 
Focus on fun leads to organizational laziness and mediocre performance
Low performers are passed along versus being performance managed 
The morale of the headquarters facility is very low with the exception of the college hires
No growth path for HiPo talent and no retention strategy
Large scale organizational changes are frequent, communicated poorly and generally unsuccessful 
People pretend to like one another and use that to promote “a world class culture.” Its no different than anywhere else. The politics, while present in all organizations, are especially rampant here
Roles are often changed without consulting the affected employees in advance. 
Different pay scales for the same role exist throughout the company. Often times a decrease in pay must be accepted in order to make a lateral move to a different area
Preselection of candidates is the norm yet full interview processes take place wasting the time and energy of candidates. Word gets out frequently about who has gotten a role before the job itself has even been posted
Spans and layers are wildly different. Managers running director level scope and vice versa is not uncommon (spans and layers issue)
Advice to Management
Put a serious performance management system in place that works and hold low performers accountable. 
Ensure that people leaders are capable of and desire to grow, recognize, and retain talent and address it when they don’t 
Create a HiPo program that ensures top talent has differential investment, the right leaders, and fulfilling roles.

","Unfair punishment, wrongful termination, watching others get away with sexual harassment, fighting and others able to accuse you of harassment on social media and not being able to defend yourself even when you provide evidence that you were being harassed. Delete all social media and give no one your cell phone number if you are on probation because they will use it against you if you are wrongfully accused. Don’t do it it isn’t worth it
Advice to Management
Listen Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport Management, when you have a loyal employee that has served you for 7+ years at the call center as a staff member, seen someone not protected by the union get away with 3 sexual harassment cases against 3 different women along with 2 DUI’s and be allowed work furlough while staying in jail before coming to work and keep this employee, but firing me because a terrible employee with a track record as being a troublemaker for the 2 years he barely worked there accuses you of threatening him when he was the one doing the threatening. I kept a gleaming record for 7 years working for hundreds of different employees (reservation agents) team leaders, center leadership, won the star award, was sent to have dinner with the CEO trained your contractors traveling to Dallas, the worst of it all is I was accused of threatening an employee in Portland but weeks earlier two ramp agents were in a fight on the tarmac in front of supervisors, one employee yelled out “I’m going to kill you” he was fired but was reinstated in his job by the union!!! I was not represented by the union but was told by the union that I was mistreated and should seek an attorney, I tried employee relations first but was told I would get a call back which I never did. Then I got a lawyer but SWA lawyers lied and said I did indeed threaten this guy. I reached out to the CEO hoping he would listen to my case because the facts that I supplied my phone records, was willing to give my social media passwords and anything to save my job but was not even looked into. During my history with Swa I brought on multiple employees, one became team leader one apart of the staff. I gave my all to this company and then some. 

After 7 years I really got screwed so trust me when you are on probation delete social media, avoid giving out your phone number, trust NO ONE! There are plenty of other airlines out there but hurts when you devoted your life to a company and are treated like garbage. Avoid the Phoenix Sky Harbor Leadership because they are heartless and power hungry. Give the people the Benefit of the doubt especially when you have been on probation for 5 months you receive a great appraisal, many kick tails and were a top performer. It just isint right.

I have been working at Southwest Airlines full-time for less than a year
Pros
Everything that you've heard or expect a job at Southwest to be like is true. The company really values employees and creates a fun working environment.
Cons
Non-rev travel out of Dallas could be better. There is no visibility to the standby list, so you never really know if you are going to make a flight.
Also, a large portion of compensation (401k 9.3% match + Profit Sharing) are for retirement. Both have a 5 year vesting period, which is way too long--especially for Profit Sharing. If you need to leave before five years, you forfeit 100%/80%/60%/40%/20% of those earned benefits and any associated investment income.

","40 yrs, 30 rs, 20 yrs, 10 yrs and maybe even 5 yrs ago one could sell the PR line of this being the best of the best. Not any longer. As the company has grown so has the disappointment among employees. The fun loving atmosphere has diminished greatly. In my opinion, the only reason more employees haven't started leaving and seeking better opportunities is financial reasons. Yes, Southwest is competitive with their economic and benefit packages. But money isn't everything, and SWA were believed to have everything years ago. Biggest faults as the company grew was failing to follow through and hold employees accountable at all levels. The lack of accountability diminishes a great employees moral and ability to perform at the highest levels.

I have been working at Southwest Airlines full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Job Security: Most profitable and stable airline in the industry. Even low performers practically have to try to get fired from the company

Benefits: Great health insurance plans, 401k match, profit sharing, free flight benefits
Cons
Salary: You can make more in other industries. Management gives merit raises once a year, typically so small you won't notice the raise in your paycheck. ""Ingrade salary adjustments"" are essentially non-existent and depending on your direct leader, it'll likely be a waste of time even bringing it up.

SWA retains low performers and if you're in a leadership role, you have the added burden of not letting these low performers spreading this work ethic/attitude to others
Advice to Management
SWA is too forgiving and tolerant of employees that are chronic low performers. . While having low performers is inevitable, don't draw the process out of removing or transitioning them into another role so incredibly burdensome and drawn out.

","Older technology, manual processes (we just stopped using paper tickets in 2017 for God's sake!), lots of investment needed in technology. Many people unwilling to give up old processes (""We've always done it that way"").

Tue Oct 03 2017, Developer,"Dallas, TX",Former Employee ,Developer +5 years,5,"Positive feed back 364 days a year. Office birthdays and party events. Like family. Free flights.
","Negative feed back during annual appraisal. Pay less because you love your job and pass on the savings to customers. They get employees to target other employees. Too busy working to ever fly. This company isn't for everyone, if you want to work for one company for life and pay doesn't matter, you lack skills but don't mind getting others in trouble you have a chance of moving up.
Advice to Management
Leaders lead otherwise your a boss, stand up against targeting. Herb use to put employees first, something the company has lost. Need Unions at HQ

Sat Oct 21 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Very Racist Towards African Americans,6,"The ONLY con is free travel but you have to sale your shifts just to get the time off to travel.
","Terrible place to work. You are expected to put them first above yourself and your family. I was working here for all but 5 months, as soon as I started there was an investigation going on with the NAACP and Southwest regarding racial discrimination. I didn't know the details until about a month ago. It is sickening to read the things that I read in that NAACP letter to Gary Kelly, which you can find on the NAACP STL page. It's not a private letter, it is very public. After that 2 BIG wigs were given the option to retire or relocate due to their involvement in the issues. I would not recommend any African American people to work at the STL station. It is considered the most racist station in Southwest, everyone knows this who works at the STL station.

Stop gossiping about employees to other employees. Stop having relations with people you are supervising. Stand up for what's right.
