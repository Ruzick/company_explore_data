","There is no recognition if you aren't part of the employment team no matter how hard you work or how much you contribute. Some leadership ignores the contributions other people in the organization make to the overall success of the organization. If you aren't one of the chosen few you are invisible to upper management.
Advice to Management
Recognize that all employees contribute to the success of the company and deserve to be recognized for their contributions. Some departments should be recognized for their contribution to the mission of AtWork! that aren't recognized as being important. Every single person who works at AtWork! is important and deserves acknowledgement and respect by upper management.

I have been working at AtWork! for more than a year
Pros
Kind, thoughtful, co-workers, clients are amazing people, lots of opportunity to meet others and network out in the community, frequent free food!
Cons
Turnover, disconnect between upper management and employees out in the field, unmanageable and very large caseloads, company does not seem to use time and resources well (Puts “big picture” visions and ideas first before addressing and working on internal issues), too much driving around the Seattle and Eastside regions, unreasonable goals that can’t be met with current staffing, pressure from management to develop more jobs without having adequate staffing and support to realistically do that, culture from upper management seems to be more focused on still meeting numbers rather than tailoring goals to match where the employment team is at in terms of size, experience, and support.
Advice to Management
Focus on fixing and improving your headquarters office first before trying to take on tremendously larger projects. More connection between upper management and your employees, more engagement. Provide a clearer vision for where the company is going in the future. Closely evaluate the internal issues and take more drastic measures to fix those. Perhaps consider bringing in an outside source that is skilled in strengthing workplaces, workshops on topics such as leadership, structure, and better management.

","Upper management. The leadership is a problem. The CEO plays favorites, and changes her mind all the time. Everyone says if she doesn't like you watch out and we have all seen it. She will tell you what you ""will"" think, she will paint a picture to make things look great when they clearly aren't, and tell you how wonderful someone is to get them to do something for her. She and a couple of others here are a problem. I feel bad for the employees that have to work in the office and aren't able to get away from here like we do. People say at one time she was good and a leader in the field but now they don't look at her that way. She thinks she's innovative others call her scary.

Look at what's going on, make some changes. The turn over rate is high and it is going to get higher there are a lot of us looking for a job now. We see what the problem is why don't you? There are still a couple of people we can go and talk to but I'm afraid if they leave we will all be in big trouble. Do something before it's too late, and it's getting close to being too late.

Creative, fun-loving, and friendly co-workers. I feel like I'm part of something greater.
My clients are wonderful people, and helping someone get better at their job is the best feeling in the world.
Cons
Lots of driving, very little time between clients, and you have to deal with the bureaucratic mess of red tape that is Disability Services.
Advice to Management
Actually follow through with the changes you said you would make. Don't let your staff spend half their day driving because they have clients spread out across the greater Seattle area. Get the people who are really good with job development to do more of that, and let the people who are good coaches focus on that. Get people working in teams all working with the same pool of clients, where strong job developers can work alongside strong coaches to find the right match for clients.

Advice to Management
Consider the total hours on someone's case load before adding more clients. If someone needs job development hours, they actually need time in their day to go job hunting. Also, consider making a vendor-accessible ""looking for work"" page that allows potential employers to learn about their potential employees or post their own job openings.
