","The pay is low for the industry
Training programs are insufficient. We all basically just have to ""figure it out"" on our own at first, nobody knows what they're doing, or why they're doing it (how it ties in to the rest of the company) unless a co-worker trains you, so you better hope they have time to train you right or you're SOL!
HR processes can be a nightmare. No employee should have to wait several months for the pay increase to go through after getting a promotion!! That is totally unfair and unethical.
The most talented people always end up leaving because the lack of pay increases TD is willing to give them. That on top of insufficient training processes, makes it so we are constantly training new people. This takes away from everyone's productivity and time.
Systems are outdated. The outdated methods we have to use waste so much of everyone's time, TD is very slow to catch up with new technology and automation.
Advice to Management
TRAIN your employees better! Don't make them ask a million questions, but be proactive in teaching them things. It will save us all time in the long run.

Be an advocate for your employees. If they deserve a raise or promotion, make sure that happens! Or they will leave. 

We need more holidays off. For example, there's no reason we should have to work the whole week of Christmas and wait hours for an email to come in. If we are that slow just let us have the day off with our families. (Many vendors and resellers do too!)

","-Lies from the start
-Extremely low pay
-Provides snacks and sugary drinks as compensation instead of actual money
-Promotes give aways of TVs/laptops/random electronics as prizes instead of money 
-Goals are extremely high and you are not just responsible for your own sales, but the members of your own team
-You are told to reach goals, and your manager will tell you that parts of your goal are just not attainable, and that’s just the way it is
-Management is so overwhelmed that they can not handle the amount of agents they have to take care of, so don’t expect any actual coaching
Advice to Management
-Offer higher base salary to compensate for terrible commission structure 

-Get better group insurance plan, United PPO plan is tired and lackluster coverage, employees need better coverage...also if you are going to pump your employees full of garbage, at least offer better insurance to cover the diabetes you are probably leading them to. 

-Pay the sales team money instead of giving away trips and prizes... if I want a trip or prize, I’ll buy it with the money I earned with the sales I made.

","Pay and benefits are definitely on the low end. Once you learn some concrete skills, you can take those with you and go earn 30, 40, or even 50% more and get better benefits elsewhere.

Advice to Management
It was painful to leave as I loved my work and colleagues, but at some point you have to look out for yourself as management seems to always be covering themselves. If you are going to tell employees that a promotion is occurring soon. That generally means a month or two. If you drag employees along and make them wait 6 months to a year, the smart ones will eventually get up and find a better place to work. Look in to departments with high turnover and hold the management of them accountable as there is probably a reason behind it. The cost of turnover and losing tribal knowledge is high and doesn’t seem accounted for.

","The pay is bad and since being bought, Techdata is lowering sales salaries in a couple different ways. Commission has been changed to bonus, so they have more flexibility in making it nearly impossible to get. You are forced to carry budgets for companies that no longer do business with TD. The new compensation plan is extremely difficult to calculate considering they are beginning to limit employee visibility to sales figures and instead you rely on occasional updates from the same compensation team that messes up paychecks multiple times every year.

We are also required to carry budgets for other team members despite not having the visibility or ability to affect those sales. 

TD is quietly changing all sales commission plans to a bonus format with numerous sales growth gates that makes it very easy to get zero bonus if you miss anything. Less $ for you, more for TD. My group was the first to change last year and a 2nd team was changed last quarter. They are going slow to limit the impact of employees quitting. This effectively lowered my pay by 20%.

SSRs made about $50-65k/yr before and are forecasting 10-15k less annual income after the change.

Sun Feb 17 2019, Electronics Repair Technician I,"Columbus, OH",Current Employee ,Solid employer so far,3,"I have been fortunate to have a really good supervisor. I've only been at this facility for a few months and have had no complaints. My benefits are good. My schedule is pretty strict. 8a-430p or 6a-230p, my choice. Once we get 40 hours they pretty much make sure we go home (atleast in my department). I haven't been forced or given overtime hours. So my personal life is pretty stable outside of my work hours. HR has been good to me and also my direct supervisor and manager. Was given proper training before being turned loose on my own. Now I work at my own pace with minimal supervision. It's a stable feeling job that doesn't really effect my personal life. When I leave work in the afternoon, it doesn't go home with me.
","Although I'm happy with the facility and the benefits, I feel the actual pay is a bit weak. I have been offered higher paying jobs to go to other companies since I accepted this job, but I turned them down. My job feels pretty secure here and I really like the people I work with. Hopefully once I've been here a bit longer they will re-evaluate my pay and increase it accordingly. I feel I really undersold my abilities during my job interview. I had much more experience than I wanted to give myself credit for, but didn't want to oversell myself. I think my current pay reflects that decision. But it's one that is my fault and I've chosen to live with it for now.

Fri Feb 01 2019, Void Fill Operator,"Fort Worth, TX",Former Employee ,"Worked there for two years, sometimes long hours, with no issues until late in my employment",5,"I worked for Tech Data for about two years, from about June 2016 through May 2018. During the earlier part of my employment, there were no issues; I worked peacefully at my station by myself as a void fill operator without any problems with supervisors or other employees until late in my employment. Was a temporary employee for one year through Staffmark Temporaries, then was hired permanently, with a raise. Worked a lot of overtime during some periods but received good compensation.
","In early 2018, a woman in her late 20s told me, while on the job, confidential stories about her personal relationship, and that when she was 19, she first became involved in an intimate relationship with her 14-year-old boyfriend. I was quite astonished that somebody would tell me this while at work. When I told other employees and management, one of the managing staff told me not to dare say anything about it, appearing to defend the woman. At that point forward, Tech Data began building a file, alleging numerous things from being too loud, to damaging equipment. Furthermore, a man in his early 50s was making inappropriate remarks to and coercing an 18-year-old girl who worked there, and, in my personal opinion, believing that was wrong, raised an objection, when he responded to me, rudely and loudly, almost appearing to acknowledge his wrongdoing, “You know what? I don’t like you anymore! Don’t talk to me!”. In May 2018, I was escorted from my workstation to the manager’s office, where I was told that I was terminated, and the two managers who were present made sarcastic remarks, smiled and joked about the matter, and, while smiling, told me that I spit on the equipment, which was untrue, along with other similar allegations. I had applied for unemployment benefits which were initially denied due to Tech Data’s allegations, however, in my appeal, which was successful, and based on these facts, Texas Workforce Commission ruled that I was not at fault.

Tech Data was a good company, and there were many nice employees who I enjoyed working with, however, I believe that towards the end of my employment there, I was treated very badly by management. Furthermore, Tech Data refused to hand over a copy of my employee file or disciplinary records, and also failed to hand over any relevant documents (other than a voluntary resignation packet) upon the termination, giving me limited evidence for complaints (other than the TWC ruling, where the employer, Tech Data, failed to appear at the hearing). Very disappointed in Tech Data.

Sat Feb 16 2019,Anonymous,"Clearwater, FL",Former Employee ,Boring and low pay,5,"Young staff, free food, company events. I did think my manager was great!
","I accepted this job even though the pay was very low because of the pros. The pros really aren’t worth it at all. I thought the company culture was going to be a lot better than it was. The company is just so large which is cool in a lot of ways but the company culture really isn’t there. Most of the jobs are boring so people spend all day gossiping which is annoying to listen to. The pay is very low and getting raises is a standardized process so they are low and after certain lengths of time. Switching positions or moving up to a higher role takes about 18 months I think.. and then you have to stay at that role for another 18 months I believe. So it is a slow and long process to move up in the company. There are also so many other people with the exact same boring, low pay job as you who also want to move up. I wasn’t in sales so the interview and hiring process took over a month. My friend who works in sales ended up applying for a higher level job after 18 months of employment and that process took her 4 months to transition to the new job. I think she had to wait a whole month to hear back. That personally would be really stressful for me. That was when i knew i didn’t see a future with the company. I couldn’t imagine waiting 18 months to be able to apply for a barely better job, get a $3 raise, and then have to patiently wait a month to hear back. You have to be very patient to work here i guess. Overall, tons of boring low paying jobs and very few higher up jobs that may or may not be just as boring.

Thu Aug 30 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,"Low Morale, Low Pay, highly toxic environment",8,"Free parking and no coin operated bathrooms yet. Cost cutting measures could change that to help offset costs as the margins are very thin.
","Like many large companies, you get a bit of everything - good and bad. The pay is very low for many and turnover is high in some departments. It has become a lot worse after the acquisition of Avnet. Layoffs were rampant long before this, but have become a common place now. Handling of these terminations were done very poorly and many former Avnet employees have been vocal about it, but only found closed eyes and ears. Many good employees have left since the acquisition.

It was just announced to the market that the company is going to have $90 million in cost cutting in the next year or so to help improve profits, so the expectations are that even more layoffs will be forthcoming, Time to start looking elsewhere especially since the economy is good. I have stayed this long due to having to deal with a sick parent, but no more. 

Moral has been low for many years and this has made it worse. In general, regardless of what department you talk about, the environment is very toxic. It's made worse when one department is pitted against another and the actions they take is for their own benefit instead of the company overall. 

This is mostly due to senior management, who are in offices, show very little regard for employees on the floor, show a lot of favoritism, have a negative attitude in general and place blame on others when they should be looking in the mirror.
Advice to Management
Show more respect to your employees and don't be obvious about who your favorites are. The open office environment makes your actions open to many around there.

A lot of the work is mindless so its nice if you dont want to try in life
High turnover leads to a lot of room for advancement 
Flex policy allows wfh and condensed work week once 6 months into position
Pays high, low on hourly basis though
","Upper management: always says they are pushing for change but when it comes to it they make excuses not to when it would save time and money. Leadership expects you to know everything they know but gets frustrated when you don’t know but refuses to actually get involved to train employees. No effort to develop employees 
Training: none after first week
Turnover in finance dept: loses one employee every two months
Hours: work til 7/8 during regular time, 11 pm up to 3 am is EXPECTED during quarter ends
Communication: teams do not communicate well at all. Too many tenured employees withhold knowledge to retain value resulting in avoidable problems
Tasks: far too much non value add work, especially for the position level
If you finish your work, you don’t get to work on the projects that add value, you just work on others non value add work

Rather than trying to force a good atmosphere by effectively cheerleading, which no one falls for after their first couple months, they should be more willing to seek honest feedback and accept reality if people aren't happy.

It's hit or miss with who you'll be working for and with and there are some standout wonderful people there. I met some of my best friends there, but that is more related to physical location than working environment I would assume.
- I thoroughly enjoyed my time with TD before the merger, but it's a different company with new a new leader, set of principles, and direction.
","- Office politics run rampant.
- Lack of standardized training in nearly every department.
- Lack of direction and feedback will depend entirely on your manager as they operate semi-autonomous fiefdoms of desk clumps.
- Despite local awards, there is an obvious lack of real inclusion. An overbearing conservative mindset only fosters this as they use anecdotal examples rather than real solid statistics to market this facet.
- HR is there to look out for the company and often powerless or straight unwilling to make any improvements.
- Open floor plans do not foster a positive environment especially when the wage gap between even team members is stifling. It's also terrible for concentration in a technical field or when working with large calculations.
- Lower level people (nearly all the general employees) are often kept entirely in the dark but are expected to react swiftly and with little to no support.
- Will treat your employment like a gift you cannot repay.
- High turnover in sales, internal logistics, and at logistic centers (warehouses).
- Willing to undergo massive remodeling and branding projects while enduring layoffs had an unsurprisingly negative effect on company morale. 
- There is a clear double-standard in terms of daily responsibilities and expectations for what is seen as the ""inner-circle"" of management and their confidants and the rest of the employees. (The 13 Club was a nickname for the entry level people that felt a clear divide between those making entry level pay for years and those shopping for new Mercedes at their desk loudly.) There's nothing quite like watching bonuses get literally handed out to your team members while you're struggling.
- Compared to a lot of places around here the pay is standard, but for IT professionals who are often able to work remote at companies, the financial incentive is minimal. 
- Meetings to have meetings about meetings. It's 2017 and anything that can said in a meeting can be done on a WebEx or in email. There are much better ways to build trust between a team than a meets on weekly numbers.
- Don't expect a cost of living or raise in general without a promotion.

","low pay, menial & tedious work, large workload, inconsistent policies & procedures, mass layoffs/slow to re-hire, system enhancements are slow to be implemented, lack of a centralized location for pertinent info, lots of digging through old emails to ""research"", dumb processes & rules that make your job even more tedious

What this company does is start laying off people out of the blue, then moving the fired employee’s responsibilities onto the ones that are left. Then as business starts to increase, they continue to spread more duties to the existing employees on a team, but don’t want to pay them extra. The same low pay rate for much more work. They discourage overtime. They would rather burden and overwhelm the existing employees, including management, rather than to hire/pay a new employee. They prefer to have contractors or hourly-pay workers than permanent, salaried employees. If you want to work here, don’t let them make demands on your time outside of work hours…because they will if you let them. 
Supplier sales reps intimidate customers into orders they do not want and harass them until the order has shipped. It's a very strange dynamic to be in the middle of.
Considering the company (Avnet, now TechData) brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in sales from each supplier (and they have multiple suppliers), yet income is near the poverty level, is disheartening.

Many of the jobs here are jobs in the most abysmal sense of the word - cog-in-the-wheel, ""waiting until it's automated"" kind of jobs. 

It also really sucks how cheap they are. They make you pay for plastic forks and knives for lunch. The coffee is undrinkable without a tremendous amount of sugar. They'll send you offsite on an assignment with a mini laptop meant for children (this actually happened to me...it had a sticker that said ""edu"" on it)

Advice to Management
When you first approach a small group of employees talking, and one of them is a new member on your team, instead of placing your back against him and backing up to give him the hint to walk away, try welcoming him to your company and at least act interested that he will be contributing to your team. Totally happened on week one, what a jerk!

","Company is and acts cheap! And so with people. If talking about overall company culture and particularly IT... Historically people factor is not valuable, they are just numbers. HR does not care at all if you leave no matter how valuable you are, so the bosses. Everything is an emergency and priority. It drives you crazy and burn people out after a while, except you don't give a dime about what you're doing. Benefits compared to other big tech/IT companies are ridiculous. Management is a total disaster and mediocrity but what to expect if company is concentrated on hiring cheapest labor.

","Everything moves at a snail's pace and is hindered by mountains of corporate beauracracy. Salaries aren't very competitive. New policy dissallows transferring to positions in other departments. Great company to work at if you are in sales; loads of perks; everyone else is 2nd-class citizen.

Also, I find it strange that a Fortune 500 IT company provides employees with such old technology. Until 2012, our main system was DOS-based and our phone system still appears to be from the 70's...I see cutting edge tech in our solution center, but it doesn't reach our desks.

Overall, good place to start and get something on your resume; not good place to stay and grow anymore.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the no-transfer policy. It discourages learning, out-of-the-box-thinking and stagnates career growth. Many employees get an entry level position in one department so they can learn and then move to a department that fits them better. Keeping them from transferring is keeping talent away from where it's most effective! Also, this will drive employees to seek employment elsewhere to grow their careers.

Reduce the beauracracy. TD needs more efficient policies and processes so that changes can be made quickly in an industry where change is accelarating exponentially.

Invest in your employees. We constantly hear that we are 'awesome' and your 'best asset', but it's only words if you don't back-it-up with your money. Raise salaries, allow us to work remotely, etc... That will keep the talent you have and attract more. If your people are your best assets, invest in them.

Great people 
Management (in my experience) supports their employees
","So many: 

SSRs aren't considered to be sales people so they get no cut of their team's commision. For example: SSRs are expected to place the majorty of their team's orders but it makes no difference in their pay if they spend half a day placing a million dollar order or place 20 easy orders. On top of that, a lot can go wrong that isn't your fault but everyone will point their fingers. The order placement system is complicated to say the least and you have to remember a million different specifics depending on what vendor you're placing the order for. Orders also have to touch many departments to be released. If you don't follow up with logistics because they didn't release the order, it's your fault again that the customer didn't recieve their product. At the end of the day a customer isn't happy if they don't recieve their order so you have to play every single role and other departments aren't held to the same responsibility as you are. Because of that there is a lot of pressure on SSRs to place orders correctly, fix issues, and do everything else for their team's very spoiled and demanding customers. 

And for all of that pressure you get paid 13 an hour. 

Your day will be spent drowning in emails, calls, figuring out why the system is glitching, and waiting on Vendors to explain why they delayed shipment for the third time so your angry customer will stop calling.

Sun Aug 10 2014,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Great Place to Learn,1,"Tech Data is a great place to learn many different aspects of business. With hard work and a willingness to think ""outside of the role"" you will absolutely be promoted in a short time. Because this is a very high volume company in an extremely dynamic industry, there is never a shortage of possible projects, improvements, opportunities to shine. Bob D is the most down to earth CEO you'll ever meet, very approachable and solid. Tech Data has treated me well overall, and I've mostly had strong direct managers.
","Career progression is somewhat limited and pay is below average for the industry. There is constant use of the mythical term ""career path"", which is a fancy excuse for not paying like a top company should. Tech Data tends to lose top talent in a stable economy because of unwillingness to change its compensation philosophy. Executive management can be slow to change and will never be called trendsetters in the tech world. Strategic direction is very solid in some areas and archaeic in others, leading to some inconsistency. All of this is within the norm for a global organization.

Bottom line, they don't care about projects in the US and can make your projects late. Then you get blamed for other teams not delivering their work in time.

The management team continuously over commit and look towards development staff to bail them out by working long hours. You get threats and some even get fired if they refuse or don't work 15 hours a day.

Management in all their incompetence, does not accept responsibility for anything and put the blame on their developers. All complaints and objections fall on deaf ears and when they don't listen and projects go wrong, they blame devs again.

Tue Apr 28 2009,N/A,"Clearwater, FL"," in Clearwater, FL",Not the worst place to work but nowhere near the best,3,"The previous review hit the nail on the head. It's a paycheck. Big company, so you can always find people you like and enjoy working with. It's good if you like a monotonous workplace. A negative to some, to be sure, but it is nice to always know what you're going to get. There are very few surprises.
","For some reason a decent percentage of lower and mid-level management seem to be poorly suited for the job. My manager was friendly and positive, but clueless as to how I did my job. The pay is okay, but opportunities for advancement aren't as plentiful or fairly rewarded as you'll be told in the interview.

There are A LOT of meetings and I swear I've been to meetings to discuss if there were too many meetings.

It's not a bad place to work, but it really is a gray cubicle environment and that wore on me over time. When I put in my two weeks I had about half to 75% of the people I work with admit they hated their jobs and couldn't wait to go somewhere else.

Tue May 05 2009,N/A,"Clearwater, FL","Product Marketing in Clearwater, FL","If you cannot find a job anywhere else, this should be your last resort.",6,"If you're right out of college it's a half way decent starting point; just one notch above an unpaid internship. Make sure you fluff up your resume since other companies in the area also view Tech Data as a entry level company. Other perks you can get from working in sales or marketing are some free products, event tickets and shirts. It is a paycheck albeit on the low end of a salary range for comparable positions at other companies.
","There are many downsides to the company: low pay, unqualified management who have no sense of the industry or business in general for that matter. The only way Tech Data knows how to make money is to bilk their vendors out of marketing dollars by overcharging for activities, but then not following through with them. They embelish reports to make business look better than it is. I've been working in corporate America for over 20 years and this is the first company that I ever heard the phrase ""throw you under the bus"", and the only place I've ever experienced it. I think they pretty much coined the phrase. Mangement is so lacking in skills the only way they can make themselves seem taller is by cutting off the heads of their subordinates. They don't lead by example and many times there are feuds between director and director, manager and manager, etc. It sets the tone for the entire company. They are their own problem and it's keeping them from growing business.

Not a bad place to start your career but it doesn't end here.… Covered Parking? Health Insurance. If you are a slacker you will love it here.
","It is not a challenging environment what so ever. Senior MGT is disconnected from the worker bees. Long boring days in cubicle hell. Tech Data is a better place for talkers than for doers. .Very little in the way of growth or exciting new opportunities.

Thu Jun 12 2008,N/A,"Clearwater, FL","Systems Engineer in Clearwater, FL","Stable, steady, and productive",4,"Job security is very high for IT sector, working environment is fair and friendly. My supervisory chain is highly qualified and values my contributions. My particular job is one that gives me great personal satisfaction, and I take pride in doing my job well for the benefit of my customers and the company. I have the autonomy to structure my day and working methodology to suit my skill set. My management is very accommodating of my needs in terms of work/life balance; I keep a very regular schedule, and I do not encounter difficulties when I need time off. The corporate culture is diverse, and ethically-based.
","Jobs at Tech Data can be stressful, primarily due to the razor-thin margins of this industry (wholesale IT distribution); this forces the company to be conservative and thoughtful about any significant new undertakings, and staffing is thin for the workload; market and economic pressures are more difficult to weather in an industry of <2% operating income.
Advice to Management
I think that many people that work at Tech Data may not realize what it's like ""out there"", in that other corporate cultures are significantly more rigid and arbitrary; and people don't realize how well they have it until they leave. Grass is greener, and all that. This is in evidence due to the number of people who leave, ostensibly for other opportunities, but then return to Tech Data when they discover that the real world is not very forgiving. I think that better communication about our competition, and about how Tech Data compares in terms of working enviornment compared to other employers might help mitigate any misperceptions.

Tue Jan 17 2017, Comp Hardware/Software Technician,"Toronto, ON",Current Employee ,To be frank,0,"Worked there as a French/English bilingual service desk analyst and my experiences there were abysmal. The management was ineffectual, and lies to employees and clients. The facilities were good, with ample parking away from downtown Toronto. The pay was low compared to other companies, and the workload was extremely intense. Co-workers were often speaking in their native languages that were NOT english. I had some bad co-workers who tried to sabotage my work. The training was HORRENDOUS in that there was no structure. They basically simply put you on phones with other agents to see what they did on a day to day basis. Practically the other agents did not know what they were doing. I would stay clear of this company, except to learn a few things, then quit for a different company.
","I won the Service Excellence Award 2015. I have proven and exceeded the expectations. I worked for more than 3 years and based on my accomplishments, I am expecting to move to Tier 2 where I can collaborately work with the team as Knowledge Expert.

All those accomplishments ended up my relationship with the company without pay raise and promotion.

On the other hand, that experience opened up more than 3 job offers with a better pay and benefits and a very good company.

So go ahead if you are an entry level. This is the best place to gain experience and leave after 1 year. You will definitely get more salary as what my previous colleagues and I have.

Don't bother with a high turn over. Even top executives are saying goodbyes just this early January 2017.

","The company has a very high turnover rate of employees. while i was at Tech Data, they had quarterly new-hire orientations where the rooms would be pretty packed. I think that a part of this was because a lot of people who were working here were over-qualified for the positions they were in. 

Not much training from any of the supervisors / team leads / managers. When I started they were in the middle of changing their system over and i was told its not worth the time to learn the system which was going to be phased out. The launch of the new system kept getting postponed and I was never actually given training on the old system - even when I asked repeatedly. 

It is a very high pressure environment where pretty much every minute of your day is being tracked. 

I would have stayed at Tech Data if my supervisor was more understanding - they kept pushing my probation period 3 times (9 months out form when i started) for reasons like ""i haven't had time to really get to know you and your work .... over 9 months.... I don't think that is fair.

Innovation will not happen as there is no budget available for anything but the most ""smash and grab"" projects. 
Key man dependencies have been allowed to emerge all over the shop - management has not wanted to put aside the budget to address this or take the time to reduce reliance, so that is a time bomb waiting to go off. 
Personality traits which would not be tolerated elsewhere have gone untamed, since those key men have management over a barrel; that's affected the culture of the place.

","you will not be able to move into a higher position unless someone dies OR you are liked by all managers. You will be worked to the bone and only be told how the managers did good to achieve what needed to be done. There is NEVER any compensation for the long hours you put in. MAYBE a vendor buck! if you are not liked, the managers do not hide that fact. If you are a temp you really need to careful. This company has a revolving door and they do not need an excuse to let you go. There is never any room for improvement. even if you suggest something to manager or directors that could possibly better the company,it will never be YOUR idea. they look at you like you have two heads, fire you for the suggestions, BUT they still implement the suggestion under their terms to make themselves look good. the senior management is deceitful, they even go after leads and areas managers just to save their own hides. The director also cannot make a decision unless he/she follows up with her favorite mangers, (who need to be fired). If you like to be lied to then this is the company to work for. They have the lowest starting rate, can't keep their customers happy, but STILL manage to blame the employees instead of looking at themselves. If they didn't have a reduction in force (letting go veterans of the company) EVERY February, then maybe they would be able to keep their customers happy, instead of bringing in new people who consistently screw up. Oh, and lets not forget to mention, DO NOT give a bad review on your ""anonymous"" Pulse survey. Magically, the people who tell it like it is, tend to get fired!!

","The salary and compensation is garbage. For a position that has as many responsibilities that it has, you would think that base pay would be good. Wrong..Base pay is good if you live at home with you parents and don't have a mortgage, car payments, or any other life long financial obligations. You might start to think that if the base is low, then the commission must be good to make up for it. Sadly, wrong again. The goals that are set out for you are unrealistic and unattainable with the resources and accounts that are given to you. Management seems more concerned with micro managing and assigning pointless tasks. For example, the role of a sales rep should be to make sales. Instead, lets piles endless amounts on paper work and reports to fill and have countless degrading meetings causing sales people to be away or unable to make their sales calls.

Tech Data also doesn't seem to recognize or acknowledge the staff that have outstanding talents. For example, a position comes looking for someone who will be knowledgeable in a product line (ie Desktops, laptops) in order to support the sales staff with technological questions with product line. 2 people interview, one who has no prior experience in dealing with technology and this is their first technology sales job but has a University Diploma in something completely irrelevant to this job , and another person who has 1) Previous technology sales experience, 2) Previous experience as a technician. The best choice would be to go with the person who has the experience. Nope! The person with the University Diploma (not relevant to this career field) gets the job, and for the next several months emails and IM's the other candidate technology questions that they are getting.

So essentially what I'm saying is this, if you want good salary, good commission, less politics and a honest chance to grow within a company, please consider these examples and look elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Some advise I would give to management is this. Re-evaluate your pay structure. The reason why this company has turned into a revolving door is because the pay does not compensate the amount of work you have your employees do. The employees are completely over worked and totally underpaid. 
Also, if you tell an employee you are going to do something for them, follow through. Don't tell someone that they didn't get the job because they don't have enough experience and that ""We're going to have you work closely with this new person so you can learn the ropes"" and then completely ignore them.
