On top of it, the company is really good at listening to you when you voice any concerns and innovative ideas rather than shutting it down. They'll let you try for new things even if said new things lead to a dead end. This makes me really appreciate where I work.

","It was disappointing and stressful to receive the email regarding returning to work, in the midst of a pandemic, at the start of flu season. I (along with many others), have been perfectly capable of working remotely, from the safety of my home. In fact, I probably am more productive at home since I don’t have to worry about commuting and small talk that wastes so much time. I don’t understand the justification as to why AbbVie would think that returning to a huge office, at full capacity, is a good idea. I thought it was just me, but then I saw the news article today and I’m relieved I’m not alone. Naturally, I feared that there would be repercussions for voicing my opinions. I am hoping AbbVie can also rise to this challenge, as it’s employees have, and move forward with being flexible with remote working. Reducing the office footprint could potentially save millions in rent/overhead too.

","Within the Customer Complaints Handling and FDA Reportable Events Document Control Department, the management had challenges with proper direction and control with collaborating with their partnered companies and the FDA process. New Hire Training was not sufficient and not supported to properly have an employee feel confident and comfortable with performing the duties and tasks to follow the strict guidelines in reporting pharmaceutical and product discrepancies for patients and pharmacies. Some team members were supportive, some were not as kind and friendly.
Advice to Management
Focus on identifying the exact processes and time limits required for document control between all parties involved, then design a proper plan ,(standard of operation), the will not cause unnecessary minimal time restrictions to complete a complaint report. Other departments would hold onto a report for review far too long before submitting to the Complaints Team for final FDA filing, causing undue stress.

This will take time, but we are committed to driving positive change.

","-Abbvie 'culture'
-""We have employees safety first and foremost"" could not be more false and hypocritical. The emphasis and importance placed on being in the office for roles that do not require, in any fashion, to be physically present is truly remarkable, disturbing, and really just sad.
-In the typical Abbvie elitist mindset, the leaders believe we are above the pandemic and can simply ignore it. It is clear now they believe not being in the office is hurting business (despite evidence to the contrary) and that forcing knowledge employees to go back to normal office culture will solve sales problems that have nothing to do with being face-to-face in a conference room and everything to do with external factors such as.... you guessed it... the PANDEMIC happening!
-VP and above self-perception of immortal omnipotent beings yet all are afraid to voice a dissenting opinion to anyone above them. This is a Yes-man/woman environment. 
-Profits over all else mentality despite an above-average attempt to mask it with patient-centric propaganda machine firing on all cylinders internally and externally. I can't stress this point enough. COVID has clearly revealed Abbvie does not care about anything besides profits with respect to employees and patients.

","The company has a caste system. The caste is divided by grade. Managers have grade 18 and above, while minion employees have grade 17 and below. Minion employees are the life blood of the company, yet have no stock, 8% bonus with no performance modifier, and will have to jump through many layers of politics to get promoted. Meanwhile, managers will qualify for stock, 15% bonus with performance modifier ( up to 200% modifier), and exclusive access to fast-track promotion. As the company tries to consolidate three sites in the Bay Area and move to SSF, in the words of Tom Hudson, the company’s CSO, this move will bring more opportunity to everyone. Yet, what we saw in the past three years were fast track promotions to all the managers. Now there are a lot of Directors, Managers, Senior Directors, etc etc. The minion employees are left behind with no clear vision of advancement. At the same time, the managers have the privilege to work from home in their little castles for a foreseeable future, and the minion employees are all recalled on-site to work. To add salt to the injury, the company took back the free lunch benefit for onsite workers, and leave the employees struggle to find lunch. The implementation of Eat Club has been a disaster.

You cannot force people to collaborate and meet face-to-face if they are not comfortable with it. Why does an HR or IT employee need to be on site when they can go home. They will only risk themselves, other employers and their families. It's a hypocrisy when company says they are working for COVID-19 drugs. 
If you do not value employees, you do not value the health or well-being of customers. 
This short term focus on bottom line at expense of employee and society well-being will come to bite the company! The company didn't learn from what happened at Biogen with COVID-19. Look elsewhere, most of the other employers including in pharma & healthcare are much more flexible!

Outsider could be anyone: a person of color, not the right gender, have a thought outside of the box, management doesn't like them, etc
A bit toxic where they will be nice to you on face but won't give career opportunities to grow or advance. Many marketing directors don't have the right background or experience and have done only one or two things in marketing. Or have been with the brand for long enough in sales and are made marketing directors. Some of these Marketing Directors don't know to even read a financial report or simple KPIs, but they get backing from Sr Leadership as they fit their club (white). It's unfortunate but hey that's what they want as a company. 
If you look at AbbVie's leadership team, there is mostly white men and one or two women. Isn't that something, when non white men and women have not pierced at that level then it also shows why? because no organic encouragement within the company.

","People with Director titles rule by emotions, mostly fear, and have little current knowledge about what it takes to drive to outcomes because they have been at AbbVie too long.

Inability to engage meaningfully with team members - including contractors - and often either dictates or micro-manages while contradicting themselves with corporate talk. In many cases, office employees and contractors are told what and how to think as well as how to do their jobs. 

Entrenched silos even in the same department causes unneeded politics. Inability to plan work but still make it seem like they are in control results in everyone doing everyone else's job so there is constant panic and zero accountability.
Advice to Management
Implement work-from-home policies and require all leaders - supervisor level and up - to achieve continuous educational goals. Discontinue promoting those who have no experience in leadership roles.

Advice to Management
For someone relocating from a major metropolitan area to work here, I've been disappointed in the lack of cultural awareness, resistance to new ideas and processes, and mediocre, if not outright toxic management I've encountered. You can have a completely different experience depending on your manager and the espoused culture is markedly different from that practiced if you get a bad one. If you want to retain talent, you have to invest in and develop talent otherwise top performers have no reason to stay.

","Beware the “lifer” mentality. Some who have had entire careers with Abbott are parochial and old school in their views and really see no reason to grow professionally themselves. It can be a shock to someone coming from the outside to learn that their experience is not understood and talents aren’t incorporated or recognized. So some managers will pretend you have no valuable experience at all. If all your experience did not happen at Abbott or you are not fresh from postdoc, it didn’t happen. I know a lot of mid-career people who come to Abbvie from other jobs to find themselves underemployed and stuck.

Sat Jan 11 2020, Engineer,"Vernon Hills, IL",Current Employee ,Strong Technical Vision - Finally cleaning house,0,"Amazing company and team with a strong culture changes in Infrastructure from the new leadership with a strong technical vision (from Associate Director and Up) - with a bias to action. The VP's and Sr. D's all want to see the teams thrive and we are seeing recognition for our work. 

We are finally getting rid of some of the dead weight - and driving new culture and architectures like SD-WAN, CNF and Data. 

A number of promotions in EA & Engineering of strong technologists who put the patient at the center of what we do - and this past year the new management is finally cleaning out the deadweight who have held us back for years. 

We are building a whole new platform with some amazing new technologies and the chief technologists 3 year strategy will drive more automation and giving us time to work with the new tech (instead of relying on consultants). 

Amazing emerging technology pipeline that will revolutionize IT @ AbbVie.
","Some of the group is having a hard time with 2019 change (mainly those that should be worried) but I admit I was nervous too. That said the new 2019 leadership team in the combined ea/tech/infra group is helping drive through change and being empathic / respectful to everyone's needs giving everyone a chance. The fact is some people aren't making the ""cut"" and some house cleaning is happening. People are worried about RIF's with Allergan and the implementation of Automation, but there is so much work ahead that we need to trust leadership has our backs.
Advice to Management
Don't shy away from challenging the status quo, you are making a difference driving benefits to our patients - in times of change people fear the worst and hope for the best - look past it and drive with your strong technical leadership team who cares about the people. Don't let us fall back into the old ways.

BTW Make sure we continue to have the employee engineers / architects do the new stuff learning from the consultants.

Most of us couldn't be prouder to be part of BTS and Infra/TechDev.

The level of science is high, resulting in getting much needed products to patients. Very diverse work force and many opportunities for all. Salaries align with fair market value in the state.
","It depends on what group you are in to determine the workload that is expected of you. Other reviews claim a good work/life balance while my experience and that of colleagues proves otherwise. Working at home after hours and weekends is necessary to meet deadlines. I heard of at least one employee who routinely stays until 1:00 AM to complete their work while another co-worker claimed they are working much harder than they did in a academic job, which are notoriously demanding. Scientists conduct experiments but don't have time to document them in the electronic notebook. The salary is good but you will work for it at the expense of personal time.

Fri Sep 06 2019,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Outsourcing is getting out of control at Abbvie. Quality going down the tubes.,2,"Good compensation, good work-life balance
","push to outsource anyone they can, which has contributed to a huge decrease in quality of Safety and Product Quality reports. Outsourcing to Philippines, India, Budapest. Abbvie claims to be patient centric, but by outsourcing those who actually engage with patients, patients have a much more frustrating experience when reporting an issue. 
Also, the departments tend to bring in management from other departments that have no knowledge of the actual systems or processes that the employees use. This makes for the employees constantly having to educate management on what is going on. Why does Abbvie not move those with the most knowledge into management? I have seen it happen time and time again, and I have worked in 3 different departments. It leads to strong employees getting frustrated that they are passed over for a promotion for someone with less knowledge. Just because someone has been a manager in one area, doesn't mean you can throw them in to another department, and they will automatically be a good fit. I have seen managers make so many mistakes and almost ruin departments due to a lack of knowledge and an unwillingness to gain the knowledge needed to perform their job.
Advice to Management
Promote your best people, stop bringing in outside managers simply because you used to work with them in another department. Stop outsourcing everything! I understand the need to make profits, but what happens in audit situations when the quality has gone down the toilet? It takes so many more hours of work by employees to fix the messes created by all of the vendors you have outsourced the work to. Is this really saving money???? And by the way, I'm not against outsourcing because I just want to keep my job at all costs. I am against it because I have seen first hand the cluster my department has become.

Wed Apr 24 2019, Study Management Associate,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Study Management Associate,9,"Basic Information: 
This position of Study Management Associate (""SMA"") is the same job I had at one of my previous companies, except they called this same job ""Clinical Trial Associate"". And one of my friends has this same general type of job, and their company calls this job Operations Associate. Compared to some of my past jobs, the AbbVie SMA position seems like a blend between an in-house non-data-monitoring clinical research associate, systems administrator, and document control eTMF employee. 

This is not a clinical study manager, project manager, line manager, team leader, monitoring, data, patient safety, science, or medical affairs clinical research position. SMA2s and SMA3s report equally to a Project Manager. The Project Managers make all decisions, and the SMAs carry out the decisions. Every once in a while, another SMA co-worker wishes this job was project manager, so they just go ahead and pretend like they are, and get kind of pushy to their equal co-workers or try to one-up team members. This doesn't happen all the time or on every team, and the situation is manageable, but it does pop up just occasionally. This probably happens at other companies too though.

For job duties, the clinical research study sites are divided between the SMA2 and SMA3 team members, and it is part of your job to always be current with status updates about your assigned sites. But SMAs do not communicate directly with sites, so they obtain some of their site & patient updates from the clinical research monitors, vendor reports, and from study information which comes from other AbbVie departments. And SMAs send communication and requests to the sites through the clinical research monitors. Each SMA is usually assigned to work with about 1 or 2 of the study vendors (like the companies who handle pathology screening or x-rays of study patients, etc). And the other operational study duties are divided between the team members. The project managers are very nice about setting aside regular time to get to know you and check how things are going, and discuss with you if there is any special project you might like to work on, based on your interests, then they help you find learning activities for your development to support this. And speaking of management, I never saw any bad politics with upper management.
","Basic Information continued:
At AbbVie company, the clinical trial duties are very separated and silo'd between departments. The other departments produce the study design and study documents, and it is our job to communicate with them to get information and documents. And vice versa, we also run reports and give information to other departments when they request it from us. I don't feel as burned out here compared to other places, since the other departments do the harder parts of the study, and we can concentrate better on our job which is study communications and tracking. Project managers do some of those same things at a higher level, and also more quality assurance work, and line management/ performance reviews. There are many systems already in place for everything, so everything is very nice & orderly. A large part of this job is also working with the software systems that keep track of the study information and the study documents. (It is not difficult. Someone can show you how to do it in 10 minutes.) SMAs also have a lot of teleconference calls with monitors, team members, and vendors. A large portion of the job is updating trackers, spreadsheets, and meeting minutes. Periodically if an SMA or project manager wants to make up a new project for them self, they make up more complicated spreadsheets to keep tracking things.

The pay is nice, and we get a yearly bonus. The office atmosphere is very nice and modern, and they are flexible about working remote.

- Your career path is almost set - you may need to check some boxes in order to be promoted.
- That said, some people are promoted way too quickly that makes you scratch your head.

Sat Apr 13 2019, Senior Scientist I,"North Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,"Overall, a pretty good expererience",1,"- Culture and work/life balance on the whole in Lake County R&D seems much better than most of my friends' experiences at other large pharma/biotech at the coasts (and also anecdotally, the CA and MA AbbVie sites) 

- There's currently a good mix of recent hires/young scientists and ""lifers"" - people who have been working at the bench at Abbott/AbbVie for decades and have a ton of institutional knowledge and hands-on experience.

- Benefits and compensation for PhD level positions in Lake County are good, especially considering lower cost-of-living than the coastal sites
","- Raises aren't much better than cost of living. On the coasts, PhD-level scientists seem to hop between companies to get large bumps in pay or position - since we're the only large company, that's not an option unless you want to move.

- There's some occasional corporate nonsense, but no more than I would expect from any company (or even universities if you get a faculty position)

- The evaluation process and how it leads or doesn't lead to promotions is really opaque.
Advice to Management
- Would appreciate more clarity on how evaluations and promotions work - the only information out there is mainly gossip, and an opaque process can breed concerns of bias

- Some of the employee programs are completely pointless. Reducing people's health care plan premium if they attend a certain number of online classes wastes time we would spend working and there's no evidence it improves heath and reduces health care costs

","I and many of my peers have become very cynical in the last 8 months about the culture of this company. HR has become way too powerful, and the intention to create our culture has backfired to the point it is corrosive. I am definitely not alone in feeling this way - there is a lot of cynicism. We all know that companies have no loyalty to employees, that is just business, yet in the old Abbott culture there was at least more respect. I feel that AbbVie is headed towards the ""GE"" culture of the bottom 10% are out. If that is the intention, HR should stop being so hypocritical and just state as such instead of expecting everyone to drink the Kool Aid that AbbVie cares about its employees' development. The truth is that AbbVie only cares about approximately 5% of its employees' development. Strong employees are made to feel useless simply because their managers have chosen to champion/support someone else, and we are all only as valuable as our last performance rating. The performance calibration process is disgusting to the point of almost being childish.

Improve performance evaluation transparency by adding at least one formal written mid-year review so that employees can improve where needed and enhance their career growth while adding value to the company/increasing efficiency. Accelerate career growth of high performers despite not being in a formal development program or being mentored by senior leadership to progress (i.e. reward performance not connections). Improve diversity in recruiting (i.e. minorities, diversify target schools, not just the same schools that leadership or their children attended). Encourage/incentivize innovation in all areas to improve as a whole. Incentivize innovation and team-work, not just on paper, but by rewarding employees who demonstrate these attributes through results. Do not promote to management those who are strong individual contributors, but lack or have not demonstrated leadership skills. Some managers lack people/management skills, emotional intelligence, empathy, and desire/interest to develop others or work collaboratively. Live out the ""All for One AbbVie"" motto and don't promote those who are clearly only looking out for their own benefit at the expense of the team. Reward efficiency and improvement, not just face-time and ""hard work"" that is inefficient.

Some managers lack people/management skills, emotional intelligence, empathy, and desire/interest to develop others or work collaboratively. Live out the ""All for One AbbVie"" motto and don't promote those who are clearly only looking out for their own benefit at the expense of the team. Reward efficiency and improvement, not just face-time and ""hard work"" that is inefficient.

","Bullying and backstabbing behaviors permitted and practiced all the way up to the top, particularly in corporate functions. I witnessed behavior at AbbVie by senior management that would not be permitted at other companies. Also, the culture is Abbott-centric and often incompetent people are placed in positions of great responsibility without any qualifications other than they worked at Abbott and tell management what they want to hear. There is a general aversion to risk and managers are reluctant to act on ideas that come from new employees who didn't work at Abbott. Also, there is NO capacity to push back on bad ideas coming from management. Delivering bad news is another no-no. The backstabbing was really the last straw and reason why I left for another role at a different company. Normal companies wouldn't permit such obvious sabotage but, at AbbVie, it is seemingly encouraged by some managers. Apparently, they learned this behavior from Abbott according to people with Abbott experience.

","Not one or two but four of my managers and senior managers held grudge, and were condescending, disparaging and threatening subordinates all the time. Managers simply didn't care about people's personal or emotional needs even in extreme cases of death of loved ones (e.g. spouse, parent) let alone everyday challenges that necessitate flexible work schedule. Work-life balance is a cruel joke and remote work is an alien concept altogether, strongly discouraged and requests are mostly denied as top leaders simply don't trust their employees and want to see bodies in office instead. Who gets the office cubicles closer to windows depends on their perceived performance. Those doing menial tasks can just forget about being able to look outside the window once in a while from their chairs. There's no respect, no dignity once your manager dislikes you because you disagreed with them. It's the manager's way or the highway. There's no healthy debate because managers behave like they know everything about everything. There's no meaningful training that addresses one's true learning needs. If you don't know something already, you're automatically treated like you're incapable of learning.

Equally disturbing is how and how often managers' and senior leaders' offensive behavior is not just condoned but not even acknowledged. Human Resources employees conspicuously lack the ""human"" touch and feel and always side with the managers. So registering a formal complaint against mistreatment or rude behavior is guaranteed to backfire and met with elaborate retaliation schemes despite labor laws.

Despite constant verbal claims and comparisons to cultures at former parent Abbott Labs or erstwhile Hospira (now owned by Pfizer), leaders are more focused on petty politics and constantly engaged in infighting or punishing or finding faults in employees than building a differentiating work culture that values basic trust, human dignity, collaboration, innovation, appreciation and recognition - even simple verbal acknowledgment - for employees' hard work and contributions, and above all one common code of conduct for everyone regardless of their hierarchical position.

Steer towards Supply Chain, manufacturing or support areas but stay clear of the pharmacy, at least from my perspective, unless you like running in circles.
","Poor management selection, you have to be a yes man and too many managers with a lack of experience running loose making decisions which can be detrimental to the company when discovered in audits.

Sups and managers blatantly telling you to just do it anyway even if a process is wrong.

Seriously review the ethical and quality issues that really occur. Turn it inside out. You will find violations in every corner if you look hard enough. I know where those are. As for saving your investment, you are way too top heavy with management and there is too much waste trying to appease employees who are already paid well to do a job. Get rid of the favoritism and games played by those on power struggles such as leads and sups. Create a standardized process for all leaders to follow and not allow for employees to be terminated based on personal issues management is having on any given day.

The vision set by the CEO is not translating down to the plants. Management mistakes are clearly visible but action to reprimand or remove those from positions happens after damage is already done.

Pros
-Career advancement opportunities
-Pension
-401(k) match
-About $120 a month for single person for health insurance/vision/medical
-Management putting emphasis on employee development/training
-Country bonuses a lot higher then US bonuses (twice as high). If you work overseas, bonuses for managers can be upto 18% and stock options offered. This isn't offered to US employees.
-Strong pipeline but could take some years
-Depending on the manager pretty ok with work/life balance
-Town halls where employees can voice their concerns to Sr Management
-Vacation time pretty reasonable
Cons
-With Humira patent expiring, some job cuts and expense cut pressures. HCV pressures also not helping company and outlook a little confusing.
-Bonuses for people that are non director are mediocre (7% per year). Unless you are a director can you earn good benefits
-No yearly shutdowns
-Performance reviews can be very biased
-Hard to advance unless you know the right person. Sometimes all the skills you have may no be important but who you know
Advice to Management

-Give employees opportunities to move. Don't just hire someone because they know someone else

Flextime requests even count against the employee during performance reviews! There's hardly any cooperation across various departments and most departments hold back information from each other that would otherwise make it easier to make and execute key business decisions. The validity of verbal or even written (email) agreements between project team members is questioned repeatedly which causes further delays in execution.

I have been a long time employee in Worcester MA before I called it quits. I gave up pension, many weeks of vacation, seniority because the place has become extremely toxic at all levels.

Senior leadership should not loose sight of all levels of the organization. During speeches examples are given that really only apply if you are in management. It makes you wonder why individual contributors are requested to attend. 

Middle management should make sure things are done the right way.

My benefits ended the day I gave notice along with my pay! Congrats to AbbVie for getting the ""Heartless in Healthcare"" award! $3,000 is nothing to AbbVie but to someone with a family and mouths to feed it's definitely a hard pill to swallow...especially, when you've been with the company over 10 years and then just get treated like a piece of trash!

2. Deceptively attractive benefits that trap especially mediocre employees into lifetime employment
","I can never finish the list of cons. But here's a shortlist of most critical ones:
1. Extremely Toxic - Incessant mistrust and lack of cooperation among business units and coworkers even within the same dept.
2. Callous and Inhumane - Employees are virtually treated like dogs or slaves with a shocking disregard for human dignity, professional respect, and basic courtesy, let alone their occasional personal needs (health concerns or family obligations/emergencies).
3. Discriminatory - A senior executive in my functional area would drop F-bombs in conversations like handing out Halloween candy for Trick-or-Treat even in presence of female subordinates or peers... with total impunity! Lower level employees wouldn't even dare to engage in such behavior for the fear of legitimate legal action (including termination).
4. Stubbornly old-school - Lower level employees are required to show up at work everyday irrespective of their personal needs (health issues, child-care related emergencies, home/auto repairs, etc.) even when modern computing and internet technologies make it possible and easy to work remotely. Management simply doesn't trust people when they occasionally request permission to work remotely. It's ALWAYS my way or the highway.
5. Micromanaging - It's an understatement. Nano-managing would be more appropriate. Despite my two Masters degrees from two large, well-known U.S. state universities, I was not even allowed to directly engage with internal customers either over the phone, in person, or via email without my direct manager's knowledge and approval!
6. Callous and Inhumane - A hard-working coworker, an Abbvie lifer, was punished with no pay for taking longer time than initially expected for recovering from a surgery at a relatively old age.

I wouldn't recommend Abbvie as an employer to any talented, educated, ambitious and self-respecting person.

If this is your first professional job the place will be great as long as you have the ability to determine whether what you are learning is state of the art, or out of date. Many areas are understaffed, so there is lots of work. That is a pro and a con.
","Work life balance bad.
Pay is low relative to the work life balance and competitors.
No merit bonus even for fairly high managers, just 5-7% profit sharing.
Dead wood: Either 20 year old Abbott management, or new management brought in from dying big pharma. 
Common statements: That is how we always have done it from middle management. I thought that last statement was something that nobody would ever say at any company. I almost fell over, the first time I heard it.
IT new and broken outsourced.
it is likely Abbvie will be bought out if it can't fill the Humara hole.
Very top management spins that the company is going to be a light nimble biotech, but the reality is very different in key areas.
401K middle of the road for Pharma.
No stock options for even middle management.
Current department has high turnover of new people joining jumping and being replaced by new people.
Advice to Management
Old management: Adapt, change, have a look, what your competitors have been doing for the last 20 years.or the department will be incorrectly outsourced, and you will have no job. There is a view that it is hard to recruit to Chicago. That is not the reason it is hard to recruit at Abbvie for certain departments.
