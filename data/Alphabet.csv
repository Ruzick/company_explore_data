Meeting culture can mean 0 time to do work within working hours

Lack of accountability - somewhat inherent in culture and nothing gets done about things until it’s too late. 

Finger pointing culture 

Management are not sufficiently trained in how to support their team members wellbeing 

Conflicting directives from different areas of the business makes it extremely difficult to get things done

Wed Mar 27 2019,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Great people but toxic management culture,0,"Some fantastic people, with a genuine desire to do a good job and provide great service to customers.

The best and most cost-efficient car scheme I've ever experienced.

BMW, as a company, were great to work for.
","During my time, the atmosphere in upper management was toxic, and god help you if you got caught in the political crossfire between Directors/Senior Management.

Within Alphabet (separate from BMW) the pressure on staff was immense, and people were treated as pretty much disposable, so anyone who showed signs of stress didn't last very long. Long hours for little thanks were very common.

Remuneration was poor, compared to other companies in the industry.
Advice to Management
Thankfully, senior management has had a clearout since I left, and hopefully that will have improved matters. There are some amazing people working for Alphabet, so look after them properly.

There are some really positive things happening and real energy but this is in pockets. If your face fits you will do well
","whilst there are great people they have the most dysfunctional hr department who seem to think it is acceptable to shout at colleagues and fellow employees. The main mantra of the day is disciplinary first, understand later and in no way apologise for the stress and unnecessary strain you put on employees. This also follows through to some of the management and some seem to spend their entire day plotting on how they can get their own way and 'align' with others. The last employee survey carried out was very poor and although an action plan was apparently put in place there have been no meaningful changes and employee engagement is talked about at a high level by the CEO and hr but is not followed through with any action.
Advice to Management
Listen to what your people are telling you, be honest with your employees they can handle the truth! Live the BMW values truly and most of all open your eyes to the toxic people who will trample on others to get their way.

Mon Jun 26 2017, Administration,"Farnborough, Berkshire, South East England, England",Former Employee ,The benifits cloud your judgment,1,"The benifits of he job, you get a free car every 9000 miles or 9 months whichever comes first I was in a brand new BMW every 3/4 months. 

Employee engagement is good! Lots of activities and free treats during festive periods
","A lot of dead end jobs with no real career progressing!! 

Poor management and poor implementation of new procedures meant a lot of red tape for no reason 

Salary is very low compared to the norm but because of the car the company deem this as fair 

You are micro managed and everything is based how well your liked faverotisim is very rife in that environment 

You'll find a lot of people only stay because of the perk of the free car the average salary for entry level jobs is between 20 to 23k and some people would be doing 100 mile a day commutes, not worth that at all

Wed Apr 12 2017, Account Executive,"Farnborough, Hampshire, South East England, England",Former Employee ,Wonderful people and facilities,0,"Incredible benefits package including a brand new BMW every 8000 miles plus the option to have medical and / or dental insurance and the best pension scheme I have come across. In addition to this holiday increases to 30 days a year after the first full calendar year. and they pay your bonus, in full, even if you leave the company before this is paid out. The facilities on site are superb with a canteen and even a rock choir, paid for by the company. The camaraderie is great, there are some truly wonderful humans working for this organisation.
","Getting the simplest of tasks done is virtually impossible, the systems used operate at well over capacity so work slowly and there is a real lack of investment in the systems used whilst a new overall system is on the horizon. 
The new office is almost too big (until they grow) and the kitchens and dining areas do not have any facilities to cook or reheat food.
Advice to Management
Employees should be able to cook or reheat food. Waiting for a new system in 202? and not investing in the interim will make the transition much more difficult.

Tue Dec 23 2014,N/A,, ,A good steady job with a stable company,1,"It’s a young company, when you walk in, there’s generally a lack of people over 40 except senior management. Because of this it means people lack experience. 

There’s a lot of internal promotion through the ranks of BMW to Alphabet … people who started off in the BMW factory now sit in influential positions for Alphabet which is great but this means it lacks cross sector experience or employees who have seen how other large organisations work. 
On the plus side everyone is really nice, very bubbly place to work with a positive atmosphere, lots of banter and talking goes on. It’s a good environment to go in if you need a steady job that pays your bills…and best of all you get a free car with your basic package
","Look at the majority employees and you will see they have left school or college and been in Alphabet their whole working career, meaning all they know is Alphabet Or the mother ship they’ve been beamed down from, BMW. So to these school leavers, college dropouts and fresh graduates Alphabet is amazing… and this would be the case when you’ve worked one place your whole life. 
If you’re from a diverse background, with a broad career, you will find it frustrating working here.
