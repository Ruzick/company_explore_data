Fri Feb 05 2021, Senior Facilities Engineer,"Houston, TX",Current Employee ,Good Pay but Good Luck with Layoffs,1,"- Pay and benefits are great, though I wouldn't be surprised to see the industry as a whole start to cut back on employee pay

- Most people I work with are engaging and knowledgeable

- Company does invest in its employees in terms of training and development when times are good
","- Constant layoffs, constant fears of losing job

- Downsizing company by a lot

- Lack of interesting and challenging work. Limited roles.

- Not a great outlook for the industry or company in the long term
Advice to Management
Every year there is the same talk of People being part of the SPIRIT values, however almost every year since 2015 there has been layoffs. Every time after layoffs we talk about how we're a stronger company coming out of the downturn, yet there's more of the same the following year. 

Quit the act, embrace being the lean company that you are trying to be and quit acting like you care about your employees.

Just another excuse by COP to allow their insurance provider to minimize payments to the disabled and handicapped. COP systems are so bad and stacked against the handicapp that i had to call employee line 11 times to tell COP that i was owed money on them medical plan. Finally , after pestering one lady, she started looking at the computer system calculation, and discovered i was right , their system for the traditional plan that is stacked against the handicap, had a flaw in its calculation. They reprocessed all of my claims and I asked what about the other 250 handicap employees-no reply Inherent poor treatment of employees as i had some of the highest ratings within my career so was a very good employee, yet HR mistreats disabled employees like dirt. I plan to contact the Houston Chronicle as my longer story is even worse than this.

","Management is top heavy. There are a few token females in upper management and C-Suite, but primarily ConocoPhillips is dominated by a group of males who merely give obligatory lip service about how important gender equality is to the company.
Advice to Management
Gender equality really doesn’t matter at ConocoPhillips and one of the worst offenders is a male manager who even tries to attend women’s conferences! 
Anyone can tell by looking around that ConocoPhillips is primarily staffed by male managers. 
Example: one upper level manager shows up only about 20-25 hours a week because of his other “volunteer” work, but he reportedly still gets paid as a full time employee. This manager brags verbally and on his social media about all the people he is saving during his outside volunteer hobby. He’s never had to work an overseas assignment, works 20-25 hours in the office each week, yet he still continues to get promotions and raises. 
Meanwhile I was once told during my performance review (different manager) that I probably need to “broaden” my skills with something like an overseas assignment in order to be considered for promotion or management. I declined since that’d require pulling my kids out of school, and my spouse having to modify his employment.
Wouldn’t it be nice if I too, could get away with working 20-25 hours a week and still get paid my regular salary, get promotions, and get raises? I could spend those paid free hours “volunteering” with my children. 
Management acts like it’s okay for men to not show up for work if the fellow male employees have good reasons, for example an altruistic volunteer hobby. 
My female colleagues discuss the double standards and preferences that are given to the men. Most are afraid to say anything because they don’t want to rock the boat, affect their reviews or future chances of promotion, and most are privately worried what will happen if they don’t go along about how amazing this one particular manager is. This one manager has a reputation of getting his enemies terminated. 
I once heard him say, laughing/jokingly, “I don’t get mad, I get even.” 
To summarize: preferences are given to males, not just in terms of hiring practices, but also promotions, and getting to work fewer hours. Most male employees know that their male supervisors will deliberately turn a blind eye when they bend the rules.
That’s why I titled this “double standard.”

","When prices are low formal training opportunities vanish. Old-school culture and management values employees who tow the line, and who mimic and parrot. 

The status quo is that the company sheds about 5 - 10% of employees every 2-3 years on average. When prices are low, the cuts are much more significant and frequent. Fewer career opportunities as assets are shed during the downturn.

Tue Feb 21 2017, Geologist,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Oil and Gas Exploration,5,"The company has strong heritage assets, and may kind caring people. There are many smart talented people. However, overarching corporate vision and smart business decision making are lacking.

The work scheduling with every other friday off schedule is fantastic. I also never found it a problem to get away for doctors visits or any sudden family needs. The Houston campus is beautiful, and has excellent exercise facilities and gym staff.

Compensation is great. But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. 

There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees. The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm. This is made possible by having too many employees on low activity teams, with certain select employees or teams do the majority of the work.
","Politics, bureaucracy, bloated, games.

Let me give a disclaimer that I was laid off. While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews.

There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry.

I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. 

Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. 

I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game. Reason is, these people are still employed and will be the next set of managers in the next 5 years... the cycle continues.
Advice to Management
For the senior executives - you may want to become leaner and faster. But almost all of the many layers of management only know how to ""play the game"" of corporate politics. These managers ""rise to their level of incompetence"" as they obviously lack the technical skills that would have kept them as a technical contributor. More importantly these poor managers lack the vision and the experience of a manager at a small independent oil company. So finally to the point, if you are a senior manager don't listen to your direct reports or the system of reports coming from you underlings. Cold call your employees and ask them what the main issues are, and look to see where the system is broken. What is actually happening day to day with the worker bees and the front lines is completely different that what your ""trusted"" system of staff and advisors is promoting. Reduce the number of management layers.

Lastly, review the TMT's favoritism and promoting who they like. There is another comment on glassdoor that comments on TMT's that nails this issue.

My advise to lower level management. Manage your staff, and actually lead. Stop trying to make your self look good so you can advance! Rely on and promote team leads within your teams, and pay them accordingly. This higher pay to the more experienced employees should be because they are now at a team lead status. If senior and staff level employees aren't leading and taking active leading roles, you should only pay them ""contributor"" salaries, just as if they were a new hire.

","dering how poorly oil is doing it's incredible how well new hires and interns are treated. 

The intern program is fantastic. They have another ""job fair"" once you start the internship for your exact position, giving you many options of what you'd like to spend the summer doing. There's all sorts of fun events throughout the summer for interns. They have summer rumble, which is a competition between new hires and interns (via volleyball, basketball, trivia nights, etc.) that goes on throughout the entire summer. They take you on a trip to Houston on the company plane to visit the Houston campus - we also spent an evening at Top Golf when we went there.
Cons
Layoffs. Though it seems like new hires are pretty much immune.

I was an IT Intern. As a CS major, some of the opportunities within the company seem limited being that this is not a tech company.

","The problem is the lower management levels can be filled with people that you have to wonder how they got the job, then you realize the good ole boy system is how. If you aren't in the cool kids club you are definitely out. I watched people get promoted and get raises based on nothing more than how much they were liked by mgmt but that is probably true most everywhere. The company hit some hard times lately due to the drop in oil so I understand the frozen salaries the last few years and the drop in benefits (which are still good). The CEO should realize he isn't above sacrificing though, big raises and bonuses sour the employee's mood when they get nothing and are laid off.

He paid too much for assets (he preferred to by oil & gas reserves since he couldn't find any), ran off talented middle & senior level management, dis-incentivized the organic development of new assets (hasn't found any new oil in 16 years), developed no deepwater capabilities, alienated petroleum engineers and geologists, kept investment strategy secret (even to his own staff), sold off valuable assets, kept lousy assets despite good offers and split the integrated company right before the inevitable cyclical downturn of the oil & gas industry.

Keep business unit leadership in place long term and don't make employees move locations in order to realize opportunities. Let go of the things that are dragging the company down. Be decisive and stand by your people when they make decisions. Empower your people. Tolerate acceptable risk. Listen to your people and willingly hear their challenges and input. ""Yes men"" will not drive the business forward. Have the courage to let go of preconceived notions and listen to advice and objection without targeting those who do challenge as being ""not bought in.""

Culture was great, though low-commodity pricing has lowered employee morale and the way employees truly used to care for one another (people do crazy things just to keep the job).
","From the beginning of the year, the low commodity pricing has had a HUGE impact on the company. From the company withholding annual raises, retention bonuses, promotions, relocations, etc all in the name of not having to do layoffs, the company STILL conducted multiple layoffs. The first round supposedly was based on performance, but it has become evident though other rounds that it is surely a game of politics--with those having good relationships with people of power sticking around and those who don't (despite great performance and high ratings) being let go. It is now a high stress environment, with those of us remaining not knowing our fate. There are certainly good people still around, if you happened to be in the right place (group still actively performing work) at the right time, but there are many people still present who most certainly should be gone.

Don't just say you are being transparent, actually DO it! Rather than telling employees ""the company is well positioned and can handle prices down to $40/bbl and that there won't be any layoffs,"" tell employees: ""We messed up, we didn't plan well, we weren't forward thinking enough, we're going to have to sell off a lot of our assets to be able to sustain ourselves, and we're going to have to let a lot of people go.""

Why would you do that if we are overstaffed to begin with? Just curious...

","Once it became clear that layoffs were impending, we all lived under this threat for many, many months and the stress affected work and relationships. These circumstances are not unique to this company, but the manner in which layoffs were conducted here was particularly brutalizing and insensitive and the decisions concerning who stayed and who was laid off seemed particularly arbitrary, i.e. some very strong, motivated performers were shown the door while some mediocre talents remained.

Many Supply Chain Management new hires forfeited alternative offers due to this developmental program. Management has not delivered on their promises to grow and rotate their new hires/personnel. Many sit in the same roles year after year after year not growing and not developing. Some of the new hires are given preferential treatment due to political connections and are moved around frequently. The rest of the new hires are left to sit in their positions. It's been disheartening to witness the politics and bureaucracy that takes place within this organization.
Advice to Management
Actually move and rotate your employees. A good company doesn't just keep their workers employed, it keeps them employable. Stop playing favorites with a select number of people within the organization and handing out favors to them left and right. Don't make promises that will not be executed.

Pros
Some great coworkers, decent compensation, good company overall
Cons

Advice to Management
You lay people off, then you outsource from overseas or hire American contractors who are actually experienced in the Energy business. Your company is in dire need of knowledgeable employees, not children just out of college with multiple degrees. Train young, inept managers to treat their elders with the hard-earned respect they deserve. Seasoned employees-turned-contractors are tired of being treated like dogs. Good luck successfully completing complex projects with the college kids -- high on education, low on business (or people/team) knowledge.

I have worked here for a very long time and it has truly grown over the years; even with the ups and downs in the oil business. Conoco still continues to be #1 in the industry in my opinion. I have always been treated well here, respected by my peers, and been able to work hard and contribute what I know to be a proactive part of any team, voice my opinion, and help to streamline processes where I can. I love the fact that even though I am assigned to a specific team, I have the freedom to branch out and help just about any team that needs my help! I learn a lot from others by having this type of freedom and I can still support the people I work for and help others as well.
","The oil market overall is and has been downsizing for some time now due to pricing. That is the scary part of working in this business. You never know if you are going to be laid off or not in the next round of layoffs. It's a very devastating feeling that lingers in your mind and it does affect you. I don't care what anyone says it's on just about every person's mind as we go through these hard times. I was around in the 80's/90's when we went through this then and have seen hundreds of my co-workers laid off. I have some friends that were laid off in 2014 that still cannot find work. Good people, hard workers. It's very sad.
Advice to Management
I will never forget when they closed the Corpus Christi office. I was there for that layoff and office closing. That was devastating to a huge majority of employees. But I will say this...the Main Division Manager there, made the statement to all those that were laid off that he would NOT leave the office/close it until he knew that every person that was laid off had some type of job opportunity presented to them. And he did just what he said he would do. Let's me know the kind of integrity he had; his caring attitude that He wanted no one to be left without hope and a chance to have the opportunity of some kind to work. Even though it may not of been in the same position or job function. He made a way for them, and that says a lot about a person. There were only 40 of us that transferred to Louisiana back then from the entire Corpus office. Times now are similar to back then, the industry is suffering and people are getting laid off. Companies are being forced to restructure, reorganize employees and job positions. Don't forget that people that have been here for a long time, they contribute a lot to this company. They have a LOT of knowledge and so to say, ""Been around the block a few times!"". Many of us mentor and help those newly hired young Engineers and Geologists right out of college. We know things they don't. Even though I'm not an quote ""Engineer"" I know a lot and without my help and people like me, these new younger people are lost at times because there is so much to learn. That is why teamwork is SO important. No one person is an island, it takes all of us contributing to keep our company #1. We can do this as long as we all work together.

","As with any large corporation, ConocoPhillips moves slowly and has its fair share of bureaucracy. In my experience, the IT organization is more oriented towards those wanting to settle down than those wanting to move up or do something incredibly progressive. There is significant internal resistance to making waves. Employees are encouraged to keep their head down and follow directions. New ideas generally take around two years to implement. Budget cycles control the fate of most projects. If the oil price drops, almost all ""new"" IT projects will be frozen for the year.

I was hired to help move an emerging technology from the lab to the field for full commercialization. Unfortunately for me, I'd the misfortune of working in a very small team with a couple hired (before me) heading the key projects. Initially there was just 3-4 of us. I decided on my exit date only after three months. What was meant to be exciting projects was turned upside down and a bulk of the program was scaled-back after the restructuring / split in mid-2012. And that was after one of the couple was fired, and the other spouse choose to leave several months after. I took a risk when I joined the company but it was unfortunate that management did not do their homework before initiating the projects. Managers should also learn to manage the egos of their team members, especially in a team filled with recent PhDs who to an extent, are feeling insecure, and the only way to move up is to ""step"" on one another.

 (example: he did away with Mulva's joke of a forced rankings system)
 (example: he recently raised the bonus target rate for certain salary grades.)
- Good retirement (although not as good as Devon's) and health benefits/insurance.
- 19/30 days (work an extra 30 minutes each day and get one day off a month & doesn't count against vacation days)
 - Good work/life balance
","- The leadership in my department once told me that we do not make counteroffers to employees that have received a better offer for another company. Seems pretty foolish
- Average raises usually are around 3.5 - 4.0 percent (can be more depending on rating)
- Some departments like to ""spread the wealth"" so they will alter who gets the 1 and 2 ratings each year. For example, if you get a promotion in 2012, you would automatically get the standard 3 rating that year. It is very rare to get a 1 or 2 rating two years in a row even if you do the best work. 
- HR has just as much of a say as your supervisor/director does on when you get promoted.
- Promotions are just 6%. I know for a fact that this is not the case at CHK or Devon.
- We don't find the oil, we just follow everybody else to it.

Mr. Lance, if it is true that COP does not have a counteroffer policy how can we expect to retain our top talent and be competitive? And if we do have a counteroffer policy, perhaps you should schedule a ""lunch and learn"" for the leadership in Bartlesville because they are apparently unaware of it.

Advice to college new hires: If you get an offer to come work here then you should accept the offer. Come and work here for 5 or so years and then go to another company because they will end up paying you a lot more and will value your experience more than COP will. And if you happen to come work in Bartlesville, do NOT buy a house because that's just asking to be trapped.

The benefits (health, vision, perscription) are very good and there is a big push toward over-all wellness (physical, mental). Very nice gym facility at the main complex and a lot of outside programs to get involved in. (Rodeo Run, United Way, Employee Networks)
","There are many layers of management at ConocoPhillips and that makes it extremely hard to get any work done or to feel any sense of ownership of a role. While it is possible to get a new role and develop professionally at ConocoPhillips, there are a lot of politics at play and there are Talent Management Teams (TMT's) that play a huge role in placing employees in new roles that are not always in the employees best interest and development, it's usually for the benefit of the company. Promotions are on a strict time-in-grade and performance rating schedule, so for a strong performer it can be a lot of years between promotions. This makes it very dificult to have a strong career at the company unless you are a favorite of the TMT's or have a strong supporter in management. The norm is to have very weak/poor supervisors or managers. They are working supervisors so they don't have the time, energy or interest in developing employees. Most of the poor treatment of employees comes from top management and employees are seen as very expendable.

We are all pulling in the same direction. I feel that we are providing quality products, providing energy for our country in a very responsible manner. I could not be more proud of a more ethical company.
","For me there probably are no more advancements due to age (over 50). Our focus is on the young as it should be--however I'm afraid we have lost sight of our best experience. We have a huge disconnect between the generations. Our industry suffered greatly in the 80's and 90's so we really have a great number of folks too young and inexperienced to take the reins from us in management.
Advice to Management
You have made some great deals to make our company what it is today. Instead of a total focus on the numerator (Cost), focus on the demoninator (Barrels). We really need to expand exploration and production to grow barrels in both reserves and production.

You don't feel like you're just a number. At most companies, you feel like there are revolving doors with people constantly leaving, but that is not the case here. If you're in the finance or most other aspects of the company, you don't have to live in the ""big"" city for your ""big break."" There are plenty opportunities right here in Bartlesville and it's a good place to raise children and have a family. Higher ranking officers from the corporate office even drop by to your office from time to time and come to each person's individual desk to talk to you to get feedback. On top of all that, the company has GREAT PAY and WONDERFUL BENEFITS. The company is always looking for more ways to improve and satisfy its employees. So far, it has been a great company to work for.

If you are an average worker you will still be overpaid. If you're a louzy worker they will keep you around anyway. Once your on the payroll it is hard to get rid of people.

","Understaffed - Understaffed - Understaffed. Get locked in to a job you are good at. And suddenly no more chances for advancement. Got to wonder were middle managment comes up with some of their ideas. Can be cases of the ""buddy system"" at work. Company catering to the new hires - making what appears to be unrealistic expectations for each and every one fo the new hires. At the same time telling the old guys (that do most of the work) that we've got to work smarter not harder. Sometimes they penny pinch and don't give the tools that are needed to do the job. But the biggest thing is that 10% of the people do 90% of the work.

Great bonus structure, don't have to work for it, automatic pay rise every year
Easy going lifestyle, like a family environment, very little focus on professional work requirements
Don't need any qualifications to work for the Australian business unit, just check the qualifications of many of the staff in the ""non-engineering departments"".
Make the money you need and then get out of this company.
This company is just rolling in money, too much of it. 
if you are a middle aged white male, you will do well in this company
If your an engineer, or operational staff, you will do well, everyone else is seen as an ""administration support"". Much like a government department.
","Leave your technical training at the door. Just smell like roses to get a promotion. Pamper your manager to get a promotion.

Leave all your skills at the door.

Autocratic environment led by baby boomers in the Australian business unit. My way or the highway

Bullying is very rife in the Australian business unit. Most managers are not supervised and get away with treating their staff very badly. Australian business unit is a classic example.

Political hierarchy, not allowed to talk to anyone except your own manager as he / she wants to take all the credit for the work you do.

Don't expect to be treated with dignity or respect.

I guess there is a price to pay for earning good money = stress and depression and boredom
after the first 2 years with this company you will be severely depressed and stressed. 

They do not hire much external professionals and only promote the Americans who have never seen or worked with any other company.

Most management levels have had zero business school training in the Australian business unit.

internal processes are still in the 1970's. the internal systems and technology are still in the 1970's. Unqualified managers sit and police the systems and are blockers to all and any change.

women are treated very poorly, Australian business units have many examples, just take a survey of the women staff to get evidence of this. The company show's off every year that they will the women awards, but don't be fooled, this is very biased and if a survey was taken of all women in the Australian business unit, the result will be somewhat opposite.

There is no point raising concerns with HR, as everything is kept quiet.

The Australian business unit show case many you tube video's and many advertisements promoting the company, notice how the advertisements are with ""white middle age men or women"", this company does not like cultural mix. They prefer white people. There is not a single ""non-white"" manager /leader in the company in the Australian business.

Almost 90% of their employee support programs are bogus and just a ""show-case"" environment. None of them work in practise, a survey of the staff can easily prove this.

The list goes on........... if your not an engineer or an offshore operations staff, please save yourself and do not work for this company. there are other companies that may not pay as well, but you will be treated with much more respect in other companies than ConocoPhillips

Most colleagues were friendly and pleasant enough people to work in a team with. 

Strong focus on health and safety 

Regular business updates provided to all staff through large Town Hall meetings 

Yearly corporate health challenge which helped to improve morale and team spirit around the office. 

Nice office location / surroundings - an area in which those who were keen on keeping fit could walk / jog at lunchtimes

Some good perks for all employees i.e. free lunches and access to on-site gym facilities and exercise classes.
","Very poor initial training / handover and induction process on commencing employment with the company. One of the main reasons why I left the company I was employed by prior to starting with ConocoPhillips was that I felt I was not receiving enough guidance, training and development as a new employee and recent graduate. I made this very clear throughout the interview process and was advised that this was nothing to worry about at COP. However, on commencing employment at the company I discovered this to be worse than my previous company had provided and considered myself to be very much thrown in at the deep end and left to my own devices. Further down the line in the role, during a one to one discussion with my supervisor (who had already admitted to a more senior member of my team that the quality of handover and training I had recieved was particularly poor) advised me that they had expected me to ""change"" and ""improve"" more about the role than I had done already. 

Poor and insensitive feedback process following an internal job interview - after being interviewed by management and subsequently failing to be appointed to an internal vacancy against an external candidate, no automatic feedback was provided to me following the interview process. I recieved an email advising me that I had been unsuccessful, which included a link to the corporate external career website. I then had to ask a total of three times via email for interview feedback before this was eventually provided to me - an entire month after the interview. On receipt of the feedback, there was no suggestions or guidance provided on how to improve my interview performance in the future. Furthermore, there was no mention or explanation of the time lapse between the interview and the feedback meeting. I was only advised of the reason why the external candidate was appointed over myself, which was that the candidate could ""inject fresh ideas"" into their department and ""was from a line of work which the department had regular contact with"". 

It soon became apparent that I had been given false hope / promises at the onboarding stage regarding my future to make the role with the company more attractive. For example, at the inital interview stage with the company I was advised that there was a very strong chance that a new graduate scheme in my line of work which involved some travel to the USA was in the pipeline and was likely to be started within one year of myself accepting an offer with the company. However, the scheme never materialised and I did not recieve any update regarding the progress of the scheme during my two plus years in the role. 

Negative staff morale and a relatively tense atmosphere in general. However, morale levels varied between departments and some departments and teams seemed to have a more positive and enthusiastic disposition than others. 

I felt that there was a culture which made it very difficult for employees to admit that their workload was too large to cope with or that they were struggling with something in particular for fear of being considered weaker in comparison to others or not committed enough to their jobs. This tended to lead to a number of co-workers having to work through lunch hours on a regular basis, stay later in the evening or go into work at the weekends. 

A large number of the supervisory / leadership team were unapproachable and aloof personalities, many appeared to be miserable in their jobs and lacked effective communication and interpersonal skills. 

Generally cliquey and uninviting office environment (particularly for a new employee) and could take a good while for someone new to settle in. However, again the severity of this differed between areas of the company and it appeared to be down to the luck as to what type of personalities were in your team or department.
Advice to Management
More emphasis placed on induction and training of new employees and recent graduates would improve individual and company performance and prevent people leaving earlier than expected as a result of dashed expectations. 

Improvement to the feedback process following an internal interview to make it more professional, useful for the future and less insensitive for the internal candidate. 

The supervisory and management team need to be careful that they are ""practicing what they preach"" - after one of my negative experiences involving a potential internal move described above, the same interviewer stood up infront of a large company meeting a few weeks later and enforced the message to everyone that feedback was important, describing it as being ""a gift"" and was something which all employees should be asking their immediate supervisors for on a regular basis!

Greater focus on some of the corporate ""SPIRIT"" values that the company prides itself on through the corporate website to prevent it from appearing to be just a PR tool. 

Regular team building activities and encouraging more honest and open dialogue regarding work content and work load between supervisor and subordinates may improve overall morale and improve work / life balance for everyone.
