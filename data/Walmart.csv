Fri Jan 29 2021, Team Lead,"Hickory, NC",Current Employee ,You can do this job...if you want to.,0,"Okay. I am a reasonable person. I do not hate this job. There are a few things that I think work.

1) Teamwork. Walmart just went through a restructuring. Department managers are a thing of the past. Instead, you have team leads like myself. I oversee 5 departments. The good thing about this is that it helps to break down the walls that divided the departments before. You no longer have department managers that are territorial over their own areas and people. There are only associates within each department. Associates are much more willing to bring variety to their days by assisting in a new way.
2) Technology makes the job super easy. I never really need training on anything. Every device I pick up is as easy as a self-checkout. Nothing I've ever done was ""hard.""
3) Room for advancement. Walmart will take you as far as you are willing to go. Even now, I am being asked about the next level up. You just have to want it. 
4) The people. The people of Walmart have their own stereotype...but I like them. The customer service interactions are a refreshing break for me at times. I get along with my coworkers as well. I feel like we are soldiers in a war at times...and that brings out a sense of brotherhood.
5) Fast days. You work hard and go home tired.
","1) No victories. The volume of a Walmart Supercenter creates a neverending wave of stock. We have what's known as the dreaded ""2-truck night."" It's when the warehouse is backed up and sends an extra trailer to your store. These were supposed to end at Christmas, yet here I am on January 29th telling you we had three 2-truck nights this week. It's like trying to mop up the ocean. 
2) Callouts. So, remember what I said about associates being willing to add variety to their days? The best way they have discovered to do this is to stay at home. Imagine, if you will, being the team lead overseeing 3 service areas (paint mixer, fabric cutter, and gun sales) in addition to your other departments. Now, imagine a Saturday that you are working and your ENTIRE TEAM calls in from every department you oversee. You better learn to clone yourself.
3) Morale. The reason they are calling out is because everyone hates their jobs. It is exhausting, thankless work. If you are an upbeat, positive person, you will soon learn how to keep that to yourself.
4) Customer complaints. Go ahead, admit it....you have said that Walmart is greedy because they won't hire any cashiers. You may have angrily told that to a Walmart stockboy while you were 15th in line at checkout. Now go back and read my cons. There were 6 cashiers scheduled...none of them showed up. You told off that stockboy because his coworkers laid out.
5) Micromanagement. There are multiple coaches (formerly assistant managers) in a Walmart Supercenter. If you are a hard worker that comes to work, every single one of them needs you. You are asked to do things that have nothing to do with your area by people you do not directly report to. You have to learn to say ""no"" to your superiors...which is a weird thing.
Advice to Management
More personnel dollars, not less.
The changes made need revisiting. I can see the improvements. 
A successful leader needs to see their accomplishments at times. If a Team Lead is succeeding in their area, have them help another area for one day to catch them up. Please do not take the Team Lead out of their own area for days until it crumbles, and then put them back to fix it. They will be resentful.

","The experience working at Walmart, despite some of the core values they hold dear, relies too heavily on management. General enjoyment coming into a shift comes down to the philosophies of general management. Work can either be extremely intense or at times extremely boring. Feels like a lot of time is wasted doing pointless tasks where at times you feel your contributions mean nothing
 
Another con includes the way scheduling is done. It takes 3 weeks to change your availability and to go on leave. Scheduling at times does not agree with your stated availability and it's too hectic to change it. Work/life balance becomes difficult to maintain on top of the extreme changes in scheduling

Advice to Management
Upper management rules through intimidation and fear tactics. They are poor at making decisions and when their decisions and leadership fail, they will bury everyone else to save themselves. Everyone blames everyone else. Several managers have left due to this poor leadership and have tried reaching out to market level management, but they have done nothing to help. I have worked in other stores that do not run this way, so I cannot speak for all stores on this behavior, but what I can say is the higher levels of in the Market management outside the store are not there to help. Everything is swept under the rug. Before working at a Walmart in your area, ask around and do your research on the type of people you will be working under. They can make or break your career, as well as your home life.

","Some of those in management get too egoistic and treat those under them like they aren't human. It's almost like they're on a power trip rather than doing an actual job; which, If I do say myself, isn't very difficult. If you work there it's better to stay for shorter increments.
Advice to Management
Some of the people in management have extreme ego issues. They tend to bring their personal life anger into the work place which directly affects how they treat those that work under them. The biggest problem with that is; it's Walmart.... Mind your tone when you talk to others because this isn't an exclusive job that no one else is capable of doing. Furthermore, if you know full well that YOU are unhappy, call out. It's not worth showing up and ruining everyones day. Then getting even more upset that workers aren't happy and overjoyed to perform.

Honestly, I am proud to work at Walmart. I think for every bit of bad that one may hear about - it is balanced out by something good that we do which is above and beyond the expectation of others. Of course, much of my experience is due to having great leaders and being part of outstanding teams - in a company of scale, there are bound to be some really, REALLY bad ones. I have definitely worked with a few in my time, however they normally end up facing karma at some point. 

I entered the company with 0 credentials, 0 experience, and 0 knowledge of the industry and was promoted at a very young age. My time has been rife with challenges but I cannot believe the amount of trust that was placed into me and the amount of time that was spent with me to ensure my success. 

Most leaders at Walmart never pictured themselves working with the company for so long, but we all eventually find something that keeps us drawn in and motivated. For me - it will always be the people. 

Walmart has a strong culture and a solid set of core values which guide our decision making. It's something that you can really feel that you're playing a role in, something that you can actually place some stock in. 

I can honestly say that I could never see myself working anywhere else.

Usually $11/h base pay so if your state has a lower minimum wage, it's a decent choice.

Flexibility with your custom schedule.

Usually schedule you 32-40h a week regardless of your employment status.
","Horribly random schedule if you don't have *very strict* availability set.

They'll give you 32/40 hours a week every week while keeping you part time or even temporary which means no benefits or PTO.

Responsibilities have increased with the removal of department managers but the base pay for all associates hasn't budged past $11/h.

Some departments are understaffed and are frequently told ""manpower is not an excuse"" when we fail to get everything done in a day.

Provide a reliable schedule.

Give your employees the benefits/compensation they deserve.

","You talk to crazy people too, people who get upset when there are things that happen outside of your control, you get people who will berate you on your appearance, you will get people who will discriminate against you from your dialect to how uneducated you are because you work at Walmart, your supervising staff will not have your back, they would rather you serve the customer who berates you than help you, if you get stressed out and forget things your supervisor will be frustrated and use a tone, along with words of discouragement and or walk away, I have had all three, sometimes only one-walking away. As a cashier you will push carts, relieve the door hosts, or fill in for the door hosts, as well as do personal shopping, doing go backs and you will have to help other cashiers. Your breaks may or may not happen, if you have a lunch, sometimes you wait until it’s almost 5 hours til you get your lunch, there are days your lunch will aggravate your supervisor because they don’t have enough coverage, you will have to wait for help if you are the only cashier... then you will have a huge line of angry customers, who WILL vent to you about you needing to get more help, like you write the schedule. There are clicks like highschool, gossip is abundant, people will have no issue talking bad about your department in-front of you. There are employees who love their politics and love to discriminate against different cultures and ethnic backgrounds. Employees as well as supervisors will vent to you so you are stuck in the middle of uncomfortable situations and made to feel like you have to take a side.
Advice to Management
Stop being so geared towards pleasing the customer you loose your humanity towards your staff. Have people with actual leadership skills and humility and empathy during hardships and hard times for the store. Make an environment to encourage your employees to work together as a team instead of setting people in leadership rolls that divide your staff. Start asking your employees how they feel about their work environment and actually listen to what’s wrong instead of dismissing it because it hurts your ego.

Perks were quickly removed as well. Lunch prices increased, happy hours were limited and then cancelled, no company holiday party.

","The yearly pay increase is dismal. Insurance is expensive for families. Can have one manager tell you one thing, and another tell you the opposite (communication is bad) Any given store can be very different from another depending on the personel in the management team.

Communicate better with the other managers. Dont try to squeeze your harder workers to get every last drop of work out of them because they work harder that the lazy people.
