Advice to Management
Not really for management but - If you are not going to offer commission based on sale base salary should be increased. You have those people taking back to back calls, with prepandemic sales goals, understaffed at times, and burnt out. Random giveaways that only impact 1 person don't improve the overall morale. Up your staff and consider a 35 hour work week. 40 hour work weeks are outdated and only conducive to burnout. If people want to sign up for additional hours good on them, not everyone has the mental capacity to week after week work 40+ hours doing something this mind numbing and unfortunately in some cases even experiencing abuse from customers.

The company really invested in training and sent us across the country for corporate training which was nice. The company was already participating in remote work prior to the pandemic which was also a perk. Opened up the door for ""rotational"" roles and learn a new line of work within claims.
","Politics played a role in promoting to other positions. I witnessed individuals with lower tenure get promoted due to nepotism. There was also a lack of diversity hires and minorities in management in this particular office. A lack of transparency and a burnout culture. The job itself is very challenging, dealing with people's' trauma on a daily basis with very little support and only importance with meeting metrics. If you find yourself not in a different role within a year, I would suggest you leave.

The gain share factor is determined by company profits. For the past two years the factor has been right around 1.96. So for example if your salary is 48500, the rate is 0.08, the factor is 1.96 you’ll multiply everything to get the amount that comes to a total of 7604. 75 percent of that paid in December and other 25 percent in January

My best advice is to get the experience at progressive for claims and take to another company. Once you get experience in claims, to make good money you must become independent adjuster because big commercial companies like progressive, Geico and Liberty Mutual want to maximize work load but minimize salary. The salary is set at the beginning so you can’t get overtime if you need it they will lie in the interview but when you ask they will say you are not working efficiently. the salary with progressive was on a take it or leave basis. Don’t let this job stress you out
Advice to Management
All the managers follow protocols no matter what they truly feel, my advice is the speak up for employees. I have spoken to several managers privately and they agree that training within company isn’t good. The reason they don’t speak up is because they feel they will sacrifice job. Don’t just take training from corporate and enforce things you don’t feel. Majority of high upper management either don’t take calls or hasn’t taken calls in years. If more people speak up they can’t fire everyone. The retention rate is insane, Before starting claims position I heard from multiple sources that, a lot of new people usually leave within first 6 months. If this is the case, Progressive I challenge to ask yourself Why?

I worked for Progressive for 6 years in sales and I know I’m good and knowledgeable at my job. I took the time to learn a lot more than I had to because I wanted to grow as a sales agent. But at Progressive it’s not beneficial to know more it’s only beneficial to meet your metrics and those become less attainable the longer your their. My advice would be to take care of your long term employees. The pay raises are very poor and good raises are really hard to come by. I had to threaten to leave the company twice in order to be paid accordingly and the second time I finally did because no one was willing to see my worth. It’s sad because I know I have a lot of potential as a sales agent. I’ve since left and become an independent agent it’s so much more rewarding.

Thu Oct 15 2020, Claims Generalist Associate,,Former Employee ,Not for people with anxiety or depression,10,"The pay is great for a job that doesn't require any specific experience or background.

Fantastic benefits package, including a 6% match on 401K and a generous profit-sharing program called ""gainshare.""

If you do well as a CGA, you can move into injury or physical damage relatively easily and quickly.

Diversity and Inclusion--the company does a great job of promoting women and making sure it has a diverse employee base.
","Your job is to get yelled at. That's what it boils down to. Every day, no matter how much you bend over backwards to help someone out, they're going to yell at you. I was routinely praised by my supervisors for how well I did my job, I routinely hit my metrics every month, and I was promoted to an URBI immersion before I left so clearly I was good at my job. It simply doesn't matter how good you are at your job, you're going to get screamed at by customers and claimants multiple times a day for things which are totally outside of your control. 

Which brings me to my next point: this is not a job for anyone who suffers from anxiety or depression. You will not survive this job if you are prone to these conditions. Every single day, I woke up feeling like there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I was terrified to go to work, terrified to spend another day frantically trying to meet expectations with an unreasonable workload, terrified to say one incorrect thing on a call and be berated by my supervisor for it. This fear started to permeate every part of my life, to the point where I'd be driving home on a Friday and already be filled with dread about going back to work the next Monday. I was on what should have been a wonderful vacation abroad and spent half of it worrying about work. 

I don't know if you've read Foucault, but if you have, his idea of the panopticon is everywhere at Progressive. Most of your calls are recorded, and your supervisors regularly listen in on them and provide feedback. They go through each of your claims and either leave directions for things to fix, or pull you into scary one-on-one meetings where they harp on your failures for over an hour (one of these meetings lasted three and a half hours for me, in which my team lead gave negative feedback on every claim I had handled in the last 4-6 months--it felt like a surprise attack). Then, the very next day, they'll tell you what an incredible job you're doing and to keep it up. It's just constant whiplash (no pun intended); you never know if you're the best person in your office or if you're about to get fired. In my time at Progressive, I had four different supervisors and they all managed in this exact same way, so I think it's honestly how they're trained to manage. If that's the case, that's terrifying.

When I finally came to my supervisors with these concerns and talked to them about how it was affecting my mental health, I was encouraged to leave. ""Not everyone is cut out for claims,"" they said, as if it would be unreasonable for them to make any sort of adjustment or even recognize their own shortcomings. So I quit the very next day, without even having started applying for other jobs. That's how done I was with working claims for Progressive.

Look, Progressive's corporate culture seems great in the big picture. There are a ton of people (mostly in the big corporate offices in Cleveland) who have worked with Progressive for upwards of twenty years. I'm sure there are probably good managers elsewhere in the organization. But you won't find them in claims. I've talked to folks I met in training (back when training flew folks in to Cleveland for two weeks of fun) who worked all over the country as Claims Generalist Associates. Very smart, hardworking, nice people. None of us lasted more than a year and a half. Many quit within six months.

They will tell you it is easy to move into Special Investigations or Fire/Theft. It's not. The people who work in those departments never leave. Yes, it's technically ""just one promotion away,"" but the slots themselves never open up. People are rotated into Fire/Theft immersions every year, kick total butt and get top praise from their supervisors, and are told at the end of the immersion that there just aren't any jobs available so they'll have to go back to being a CGA. So essentially, they got you to work a year in a job that should pay more, but since it's just an immersion they only have to pay you the CGA rate. Immersions are a great idea, but they only work if there's a chance of getting an actual promotion into the role. Often, offices use them as a way to save a few thousand dollars and just get someone's hopes up.
Advice to Management
The constant monitoring and babysitting is exhausting. At a certain point, you have to accept that every file won't be 100% perfect. A claim that is worked up 96% perfectly shouldn't be cause for an extensive review with your supervisor. 

Train your managers to be consistent with their messaging and generally less menacing. I shouldn't be afraid of my team lead catching me make a mistake, I should feel comfortable going to my team lead when I think I've made a mistake.

Immersions should only be available on the grounds that, if you meet certain benchmarks at the end of your immersion year, you're guaranteed a promotion into that role.

Stop expecting employees to take on more work without increasing pay.

","They push diversity SO hard, that they will openly state in interview score calibration meetings that although someone has a better skill set AND interviewed better, that because they’re not meeting enough “HR quotas” that the best candidate shouldn’t be hired, it should be the one that ranked second or even third. They put protected classes above true performance which puts inexperienced and ill prepared personnel into roles, which hurts the business unit they’re leading.
Advice to Management
Start using true merit, stop trying to fill quotas on promotions. I count myself EXTREMELY lucky to be where I am, despite not meeting really much of any “HR quotas.” And stop limiting high PE ratings to a limited number or percentage on the high side. It’s possible to have 4 people on my team that are all above successful. Stop making me rank them as simply successful just because it “doesn’t look right if a team has TOO many high performers.”

I worked at Progressive Insurance full-time for less than a year
Pros
Proactive with COVID-19 initiatives to help employees feel safe and supported, stable industry, higher performing company in the industry, promote inclusiveness, annual gain share bonus, casual dress. Highly respected and personable CEO.
","- Depending on your region, training does not prepare you for the workload
- People tend to stay with the company a long time, but don't be fooled. Folks have different tolerance for stress and maybe they came from a career path like retail, call center, restaurant service or prior insurance experience where the pay and work atmosphere was bad and it makes Progressive seem fantastic. Dig deeper in your research and pay attention to the reviews knowing that the people who say it's great - you don't know their past work history.
- Poor work/life balance. Either you work 50-60 hours a week (no overtime pay, it is a salary position) to try and keep up and neglect your personal needs and wellness, or your try to maintain your sanity and life outside of work and fall behind, risking getting put on an action plan that leads to termination.
- Your pay is salary (no overtime) but to keep up with workload you need to work more than 40 hours a week. HR makes it clear (if you inquire) that it is NOT a 40 hour/week job. Working long hours is tolerable if you make 6 figures or close to it, but for less than $50k in a major city?? No. 
-The work can be emotionally exhausting
-Not the best type of work for creatives or people who like to think outside the box. You basically just follow processes exactly as they tell you, do not deviate even if their way of doing it may not be the most efficient for your personal productivity. For people that just like to be told what to do and want to stare at a computer for 8-10 hours, that's fine. For people who like autonomy or to look a little deeper to understand things, this is not the job for you. Also, if you can tolerate being spoken to in a condescending manner on an almost daily basis either by customers or management, this is not the place for you. 
-As with any business, you may end up with a manager that doesn't have a management style that works best to keep the team productive, but they take the manager's word on what/how you're doing vs looking deeper on what the manager is not doing well
-Opportunity to do something different within the company or get promoted is limited if you are not willing/able to relocate. Corporate is based in Ohio so if you are looking into marketing, IT, larger HR positions, etc...you need to move to Cleveland.

Either pay claims generalists a higher salary or make them hourly employees so they can actually get compensated for the huge amount of time they put in. The company can afford it. Take a closer look at how your managers interact with people that report to them.

Sun Aug 23 2020, Blended Representative,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Not all it's cracked up to be.,7,"Progressive is highly known for it's pay, and after working there, it is fairly competitive with other similar companies. They have mini ""club"" type programs that support things like diversity and mental health. That, and the ability to work from home (or virtual) doesn't hurt either. Their open-door policy feels good to have as well.
","They aren't as ""progressive"" as they claim. The systems that they use are borderline archaic (they use 3 different software for time tracking...), they don't give you sick time unless you're in a state that forces them to (including COVID-related sickness), a good majority of the supervisors don't really care about you or your success (they are basically tenured and collecting a paycheck at that point), and don't even get me started on the ""blended"" role. My advice to those of you reading this, if you get hired at progressive as service or sales and they try to convince you to go blended, don't do it. It's a position with a LOT more work for literally no more pay in which they convince you to try because ""it will help with your career advancement"" and ""it'll help diversify the every day task""... right. All it'll do is give you a lot more work and the ability for management to involuntarily volunteer you to do even MORE work when something happens (like COVID, in which we were volunteered to take over the job of another team that makes at least $4+ more/hr than you for only a $1/hr bump.)

","Interviewed & hired for Litigation Adjuster & told would only be handling lit; job description never provided beforehand ; upon arrival dumped Large Loss files & title something entirely different. Actual job duties are drastically different from what is on the job description, what you discuss during interviews and with recruiters. Extrernal hires receive NO training that is of any benefit & you are immediately held to same standards as long term employees. Work is repetitive & redundant when documenting claim files: numerous note entries for various approvals when 1 is sufficient. NO support from manager; ask a question and you’re given a job aid to figure it out. ZERO ownership for failed training & expectations; info you needed to do your job & dropped on you months later. Ability to negotiate & settle claims ‘on the fly’ not possible w/o prior authority even when you HAVE desk authority! And then every single penny must be accounted for s a range with sufficient eval is not allowed. Claim system & processes are severely outdated. They want you to think outside the box & when you do, you’re told ‘that’s not how we do things.’ Didn’t know I’d be required to travel or obtain 18 adjuster licenses prior to first day. Numerous issues had I known when job offered I would have declined.
Advice to Management
Giving external hires numerous ‘bulk file transfers’ multiple times during their first 30 days is a horrible idea! As is holding them to same standards as long term employees knowing your training is crap & non-existent. ESPECIALLY given currently nationwide COVID conditions. You don’t see us as people, just bodies to redistribute workloads when it suits you whether we are capable as new employees as handling it. Never worked OT or weekends in the 20 years I’ve done this job until now. If it weren’t for COVID more than half of the external hires would have walked out already.

I worked at Progressive Insurance full-time for more than a year
Pros
I would definitely say starting off with Progressive and going into training, I was wowed. Everyone was so nice, the pay was OK to start off with. The training seem effortless, though there is so much to learn and so little time, I was at ease that my job would be pretty easy once I got started. The benefits have been OK, and the fact that the paychecks are consistent has also been good.
Cons
However, there are things in training that they do not tell you about specifically surrounding sales tactics. In the job description when applying they tell you it is not a sales call and they do not tell you that you were responsible for Sales. In training they tell you that is not a cells causing you are not responsible for Sales but that you should mention to customers if they have any PHA offers. However when you get started, the pressure is on about pushing those sales. If you do not meet those sale goals, You are constantly harassed about it. And the crazy thing about it is that you are harassed in a way that makes it seem like it’s still not your duty but you have to ask questions this way or that way. Progressive is a money hungry company and cares nothing about their employees. Working here during a pandemic has been a complete nightmare. You would think that Progressive would be a little bit more lenient when it comes to trying to push those sales Two customers Who can’t even pay their bills. Not to mention they are also raising the rates during this time as well. The job has been a nightmare with in the last few months and I am unfortunately Stuck. HR does not care about your mental health and does not work with you on any accommodations even if you have a doctors note. Even if you have a disability, they are still pushing the issue that you need to be there. Call volume is ridiculous, you’re constantly making corrections of agents who are not trained from progressive but sell insurance to progressive and know nothing of what they’re doing. We are constantly correcting the errors of multiple sales consultants and agents and we have to be the ones to deal with it. It is above the paygrade that we are given to do such things. And last but not lease, The customer are nasty and rude. And you have to deal with those calls sometimes back to back to back to back with three seconds to breathe between the next call. There is no leniency when it comes to adherence so it is difficult to keep a work life balance working here at Progressive. So if you have a life outside of Progressive that you value I would recommend not working here at all. They care nothing about you here. I have struggled with mental health before and working here has just made it even worse. Even with doctors permits, and schedule arrangements that were recommended by a doctor, they still don’t care. It really sucks working here but due to the situation were in I have to stay here because no one else is hiring. You would think that during a pandemic there would be things a company with you to work with the public, but instead the company increased rates all around. And they also increase the sales goals for service consultants at the start of the pandemic. Least to say, Progressive is a money hungry corporate machine making inconsiderate And inhumane company. Do not work here.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees when they have personal concerns. Remove the sales tactics. Revise your core values because you don’t adhere to them. And stop advertising false expectations. A lot of people come here is because they see that Progressive is a big company and if you’re advertising that this is only customer service a lot of people are interested in that. But like every other company, there has to be some kind of plot twist such as PHA. Be true to yourself as a company and that’s what you want then say it. Stop acting like you care About your employees and your customers and stick to your guns. Also get rid of the bogus discounts that you offer customers such as E-sign and snapshot, just for you to increase their rates later and it means nothing.

Campus 2 is awesome, tons of office space and the underground hallway is a nice way to burn some energy between meetings - which you'll learn quick is a great way to burn off all the stress this place causes you. Cafeteria is good, food is okay but dicey, some days you'll have stomach issues afterwards. Beats having to leave for lunch though, saves a lot of time.

Job safety, especially during recessions. As long as the population grows, the revenue stream does.
","This place is filled with complacency and burnout. Even HR comes across like they don't care. Everyone on my team (including sister teams I worked with), including all the managers I had were completely stressed to the bone and running on fumes, and very open about hating their jobs. Headcount for most teams is way below what it should be, so everyone is doing triple the workload you'd find anywhere else. I worked at 6 different companies (mostly tech companies) before this and I was completely shocked at how much work everyone had, it's not sustainable. I will never work in a non-tech company again. A co-worker of mine experienced extreme depression and anxiety because of the job, and they found it extremely difficult to get any help within the company from management and HR. These two entities instead tried to protect the company instead of having empathy for my co-worker, they did nothing to try and help and reduce the stress and instead blamed this person for having the problems. After seeing this I wrote my ticket to get out of here.

Managers here don't understand the service or skillsets they are managing. They are purely resource managers, they make sure your queue is filled with work and that it's getting completed. They don't know any of the technical details of the work you do. This can lead to them not understanding concerns you have about a certain project as you try to prevent it from derailing or going completely wrong - so you rarely get management support. It's all about ""just get the work done"" regardless of how pointless or wrong the execution outlined is. When you are drowning in work, they can't do anything about it. It's on you to do something about it. Very backwards.

You'll find traditional IT flourishing here. Sharepoint and Lotus notes keep the internal business running, you'll be working on legacy tech, and in result your skillset and resume will suffer over time. You'll eventually be stuck here. Some have gotten to this point and accepted it, but at least they are making bank. Any new tech you try to bring in to solve problems is immediately scrutinized and blocked. You need to go through weeks of meetings in order to get approved to download and install anything. You also need to go through a change management process just to toggle some parameters on a server, this means a change management team that doesn't know anything about the tech you're doing has to decide whether or not to allow it to happen, and it can take a week to get approved. That ""Lean"" initiative is working well!

Despite the newly established Cloud org, there still is an undertone of anti-Cloud, anti-container mindset in ETS because it threatens the old-timers' skillsets. They have no ambition to learn anything new and want to coast until retirement. It's in their best interest to road-block anything new and shiny that may make them irrelevant. The hype cycle is real, but some of this new tech is to make our jobs easier and allow us to deliver things faster. Embrace it.

There's no working on one or two projects at a time. Instead you work on 10-15 projects at a time, and move each of them at a snails pace in a round-robin fashion every day. This also means you'll be in meetings from 9am-5pm every day, and you'll then need to do your actual work that you promised in the meetings after-hours at home. After all this, you'll still get the same raise % as the person on your team who did nothing all year because they try to be ""fair"".

Most people here are nice, but there's a lot of people who aren't. Office politics are part of the game at the Lead / Consultant levels. You'll find this anywhere, but the toxicity of people here is pretty unique, because it's mixed with ignorance, partly because they haven't worked anywhere else since they graduated college in the 90s. A lot of people here reminisce about the old days at Progressive, pre-2008 where managers screamed at people like they were garbage and things were really combative. Most of the people working here learned from those people, I think that's partly to blame here.

This place has more acronyms than the military.

I think the C level actually cares and are trying to make changes. But this is a slow moving ship. Middle management is where all the problems are.

Managers like to rotate to new teams every 3-5 years. The pattern here to get high up on the ladder is to rotate around to different parts of the company because experience in all areas of the company is highly valued. That's fine and all, but for you, this means when you eventually get a new manager, you have to take tons of extra time to help them understand what you actually do, what your team provides, and teach them the technology you're responsible for. It ends up being groundhog day for people who have been here a long time. It really slows things down. It would be much better to promote the high performers on the team to managers so things run more smoothly like most companies.

Don't be fooled by the Innovation Garage when you tour the building, it's just for show; a startup culture facade. There are some people who actually want to be innovative and work on new tech there, but it'll eventually be roadblocked if you want to put it into the actual environment. Most of the garage folk are just tying teams together to execute a project / idea / hunch that some director wants to try out. The services they provide are at the expense of other teams that actually do the work, they are just middlemen.

Lastly, a lot of projects here don't end up going anywhere. You burn midnight oil on things that never see full production, but even if it's a pointless project that won't go anywhere, it'll still be treated like its the highest priority imagined and needs to be done yesterday.
Advice to Management
You need a reboot. MEDGE obviously doesn't work. It only teaches you how to overwhelm your employees with workload while you sit on the sidelines scavenging for more ways to climb the ladder at their expense.

Insurance is a basic product, you're not a big tech company. A lot of the work you generate and initiatives don't offer anything innovative for customers but instead are used to make you look better and to keep your employees busy for no benefit.

LEAN doesn't mean you do the same workload with all of the bureaucracy just 10x faster. You need to actually cut things out of the entire pipeline, which you aren't doing. You're just adding more complexity and burning out your workforce.

","-They use early promotion (can promote at 6 months) as an incentive, but don’t tell you that most promotions are “rotations”, and you won’t be paid differently, or change your job title. At the end of the rotation shift, they will possibly make it a permanent position change, and then you’ll get the pay increase and title change.

-This is a burn and turn environment. 

-The workload is IMPOSSIBLE, but could be somewhat handled by overtime, which almost everyone has to work. (When we could work overtime, people were working 10 hour days on a consistent basis.) However, we were recently told (in a very condescending email) that we are unable to work overtime, as the large workload they give us, is not a justified reason. So basically, you can’t get your work done. From the tone of the email, I assume this is because they don’t believe the overtime is needed, and we must be trying to get more pay. However, NO ONE WANTS TO STAY AT WORK LONGER THAN NECESSARY. The reason we worked so much overtime is because you’ve made it impossible for us to get work done in our work day.

-No lunches. Seriously. Unspoken rule, but a necessity. No one eats lunch, unless they’re a supervisor. Not enough time for the break. There were many days I wouldn’t even be able to leave for a bathroom break.

-Metrics, Metrics, Metrics. Your workload is already impossible to keep up with, but they tag metrics onto it as well. And depending on your supervisor, they’re extremely aggressive about getting you to hit these impossible metrics, while you’re also struggling to DO THE REST OF YOUR JOB.

-If you take an unplanned day off for illness or emergency, you will come back to an insane workload the next day. No one works your inventory, and everyone continues to call in requesting things, and everything continues to pile up. You will return to work crying the next day. It’s awful.

-Customers are awful. They’ll scream, call you names, threaten to sue/come after you. The company doesn’t do anything about this. In fact, you may find a note in your claim showing an email your supervisor sent to this customer, apologizing to them for their horrible experience.

-Enjoy panic attacks? Expect them. If you care about your job and work quality, you will absolutely crumble. The people who succeed are the ones who don’t care about inventory piling up, don’t care about metrics, and don’t listen to regulations set by their supervisors. 

*Also interesting to note, they hate having us work from home, as they literally don’t trust us (hence why we aren’t trusted to work overtime). BUT when Covid-19 hit the states, they sent out the most shameful email, stating that they’ve seen our misinformation spreading around about feeling unsafe working in the office, but wanted to advise that we won’t get sick from working in an office/walking by someone who has coronavirus. They could have gotten a LOT of people sick/killed because they wanted to keep us in the offices, and lied about how it spread. They eventually sent us home once SIP was mandated, but why did their hand have to be forced to keep us safe? And why did they try and belittle the actual correct info we had about coronavirus, and send out an email telling us we wouldn’t get it from being in the office with someone who has it? Something to think about.*

","The nature of working claims in and of itself. You are dealing with people who are not happy with anything that you do for them. Insureds will tell you it's not their fault for an accident and lie. Claimants will demand you pay for their damages and lie. Customers don't know their own insurance policy in general. I left because of dealing with customers. This is no fault of Progressives just the nature of the job. Progressive is growing at a very high rate and the workload can be very demanding. They are hiring to meet the demand ,however, during peak season we were averaging about 8 claims a day - if you had to stay late there's no overtime because it's a salaried position. Essentially, the job is a lot of angry people calling you and thinking that they deserve the world. You are on the phone 90% of the day getting statements and ""investigating"" an accident or returning claimants messages that call you non-stop because they think they're not at fault.

Myself, coming from the food industry, I was pretty much okay with anything that didn't involve tips or commission. This job will provide you with a great culture, decent pay depending on your perspective/budget, flexible schedule and room for change after a year on the job or so. With that said, it's still a inbound call center, and Progressive thinks they have cracked the code to the customer wallet so you WILL have to follow their method, now called the progressive ""philosophy"". Some people where fine with it, others quit because of it, either way its a great beginning. It's insurance sales, so it will become very boring very quick, and when there is down time, you have nothing to do. If your cool with that, enjoy a great career with Progressive!

","Behind all the smiling faces and internal support, this is still a high volume call center. I will admit, they will try to make you feel that it isn't so during training, and you may even believe it, but don't. You can expect to take up to 80 calls per day. Imagine a job where a ""slow"" day is waiting 4 or 5 minutes before you get your next call, THAT'S how busy it is on a regular basis. If you have been trained to handle specialty policies, expect no downtime. To survive Progressive, you MUST like people or have a VERY high stress tolerance.

Many systems and practices are very outdated in comparison to the rest of the insurance world. It seems that every week we have to do something manually or inform the customer that we're unable to fulfill their request (in real time) because of some system issue. Progressive also does not train their agents so expect to correct a lot of mistakes, most of which end up costing the policy owner more money and you get to be the one chosen to have that conversation with them.

Attendance point system is a joke. Full day absences and tardies both count as a full point, and you may only have 5 within a year before you start to receive warnings or disciplinary action. A simple ""documented conversation"" may bar you from advancement. 

HR does not really help if you need accommodations. Your voice does not matter in the HR world unless you are complaining about another employee. If you want any kind of accommodation; whether it be ergonomic or to save yourself from their ridiculous attendance policy, you need either an ADA form or FMLA (which you must be employed for a year or longer, and they may approve or deny at their discretion). Doctors notes don't matter. 

They still use STAR for career advancement to current employees.
Advice to Management
Reconfigure your attendance policy to allow for our lives to not be centered around Progressive. Please train your agents so we have less corrections to make. Step away from the STAR format for existing employees, please review their technical knowledge in a different way instead of us telling you about a few particular calls or situations we've had over the years. Please CONSIDER those with attendance issues for other positions.

About 60% of the conversations you will have are fine, the other 40 being unpleasant or downright intolerable. Yes, it turns out people will willingly call you to scream about their poor driving record and getting a highly priced quote because of it. Unpleasant customers calling in are not necessarily the company’s fault; but their sales process that they mandate must be followed on every call no matter the circumstances exacerbated many unpleasant calls I had. Angry/inpatient potential customers are not interested in hearing about Progressive’s homeowner’s line and/or bundle opportunities - they want to get a quote and end the call.

You're basically being held 100% accountable and responsible for something that you only have 10% control over. They have become more about their shareholders than their employees. Plan on being stuck in whatever position you're hired into. There are very few opportunities for advancement, everything is pretty much a lateral move, at Progressive, you are more likely to move down, or move over, but rarely will you move upward in the company. If there is a chance for you to make a move you'll either be waiting 15 years to get to move or you'll be competing with 8000, other people for one available position who wants to get out the same position you're in. Also to the trained eye, you will take notice of the fact that as ethnically diverse the employee pool may be, you will take notice of the fact that above the role of supervisor A.K.A an overseer, there are absolutely NO people of color in upper management. Everyone is of caucasian persuasion. Any idea that happens to be both customer and consultant friendly,if it makes too much sense, they want no part of it. So you will find that you are only as good or valuable as you last PHA transfer. If you are hired, proceed with caution.
Advice to Management
Though there's not a ""snowball's chance in h-ll"" of taking this advice. There really needs to be a overhaul of the business practices associated with Progressive. Because based on the various issues their current business model, they regularly angering their customers, those customers call in and curse out consultants, you are ""stressing great and loyal employees straight out the door"" and that is not a good look for any company.

I loved working at progressive until i worked with a very difficult hr rep that was not willing to uphold some of your core values. I have a legitimate medical issue that was certified by a doctor. My first year my hr rep was friendly and very willing to help balance my work and life balance. Yet my second year my new hr rep denied every request to have accommodations made so that my work life balance was even. There was no compromising or even consideration just a flat no and when i asked to get the reason for denial i was told it couldnt be provided. I felt like i couldnt go to anybody else. My disability was exasperated and i was unable to work. Due to that i was let go because i failed to adhere to the attendance policy due to my medical condition. That was not right and i was very hurt by the way it happened. Btw my medical condition is a disability covered by the a.d.a act and when i asked the hr rep for an explanation on why that isnt considered i was told to contact the legal department. I felt defeated and had no energy to fight it. Other than that person and situation everything was great.

The company as a whole has a great mission, however it is poorly executed at the office level. There is a lot of turnover and if you are an efficient employee, you can bet your workload is going to double every time someone leaves.
My direct supervisor was very unapproachable and off putting. He constantly told us to talk to him if we need help, only to be ignored or told that he is busy and it will take some time. If your question was addressed, he would talk in circles to assure, if incorrect, nothing would come back on him. 
After working late and taking on other employees workload I went to my supervisor with concern. I was being efficient and staying late and could not catch up with the workload. His suggestion was “to think about my future with Progressive and if I want to excel I should stay late, work through my lunches and on weekends”. Sorry your company doesn’t care enough about me to spend all my waking hours there! Lots of tears shed from working there, glad to have moved on to a better place of employment!

","In today's world everyone, it is getting increasingly difficult to satisfy anyone because people are too needy and expectations are unrealistic. All other major insurance companies have significantly reduced their vehicle appraisers and Progressive will do the same if they want to stay competitive. With photo estimating AI estimating and shop written estimates, it is the beginning of the end to MRRs. In a year or 2, the need for MRRs will decrease significantly.
Advice to Management
Stop making MRRs negotiate and try to avoid paying for things that are owed. Labor operations in estimating that are necessary should automatically be paid. You're making MRRs jobs harder by the pressure you put on your own employees to save a couple dollars. Management preaches transparency but they are liars. They know that the MRR need will decrease significantly within the next few years because that is their plan, so in the interest of transparency, they should be honest and say so now.

I have been working at Progressive Insurance
Pros
A paycheck that's always on time.
Cons
At Progressive, you'll get worked like a Hebrew slave with little to no regard from them for your actual well being. Sadly, the company says one thing (""we care about our employees,"" for example) and then does something completely different. In the call center, which involved customer service and sales (as well as other silly departments that basically do the same thing), you're watched like a hawk to make sure you're ""available"" as much as possible (~80% with lunch and breaks) to take calls from irate customers who seek to punish you for simply doing your job. PSP (in sales) is by far the stupidest and most meaningless thing I've ever come across. Management is full of phony smiles and high fives as a way of ""showing appreciation"" and increasing retention, but thankfully some of us see through the cracks. lest I forget, management thinks they're completely untouchable (which unfortunately they are) and seem to get away with things that are, to say the very least, unethical and probably illegal.

","They were bought by progressive and can’t handle the volume. Continue to try and work as a small company when that is no longer the reality. Go through workers constantly. Salaried pay and given enough work to have to do ten hours a day to keep up. That stretches the salary pay thin. They are very much the mind set of “ you are salaried so you work how ever long it takes to get the job done” . No processes to help with the larger loads as an example splitting the work between a processor and an adjuster is out of the question . The adjuster handles every aspect wether it’s a small rental claim or a total loss. 300 to 400 emails a day from

","To sound like a broken record, the generalist (or if under 6 months trainee) position consists of high volume, high stress, long hours (8-10), rude customers/attorneys/medical providers (BCBS, Kaiser, etc). It does not matter which local office, that is the nature of the job. The company loves to celebrate diversity and inclusion, but in my office, diversity would mean wearing your favorite sports team which is of course, asinine. Career advancement is placed on, for the most part, how much management likes you (and nepotism) rather than your actual execution of the work. Granted, while it does play a part, management will go with ""likeability"" rather than compatibility. Definitely a glass ceiling for minorities- not so much white women. The pay is alright, the benefits are awful. I would go as uninsured to an urgent care because it was cheaper than paying what the health insurance would cover (typically $20) even with the low deductible plan. For the most part, you have to go through many hoops to ask for time off. In all, I am baffled that they continue to win many ""Best Workplace"" awards. Then again, like the billions they spend on advertising it wouldn't be surprising if it was smoke and mirrors.

Mon Jul 29 2019, Customer Service Associate,"Rancho Cordova, CA",Current Employee ,Eh just another call center,7,"At first I was in love with Progressive because during training they do a lot to push the company culture on you and how great they are. Loads of smiling faces, happy ever after stories and amazing testimonies from current employees. Then after training you get sent out into the real world and quickly realize this isn’t all rainbows and butterflies. They want you to fit to their mold and they’re very smart in how they do this. They try to make it seem like you’re not working for a corporation and quickly you learn progressive is like any other corporation. If your not one who’s into being a cheerleader for a huge corporation then this job isn’t for you. I felt like my soul was dying everyday at work because of constantly getting yelled at by customers, not being able to give real reasons as to why rates went up, poor support from supervisors. It’s a numbers game and if you don’t mind that then you’ll succeed. There is a sales aspect to it too which you don’t get commission for. As time went on I started to see the real face of this company. They’ve done some cruel and shady things to my other coworkers too. It may be the place for you but if you’re an independent thinker and have a heart ... you’ll have a hard time here unless you’re able to reframe things in a lighter perspective to help you get by. I say go for the job, do the training, see what it’s about because pay is good but don’t be upset with yourself if you get to a point where you feel depressed or like you’re not doing good enough. It’s not you and tones of us feel that way and it’s okay it takes a certain personality to thrive in a place like that. Or you may find you actually love it and more power to you ! Decent pay, consistent hours, medical benefits, team members.
","Weird corporate robotic feel. Not personal but at the same time try’s to be upbeat and fun which is confusing. High call volume. Short breaks and constantly being monitored, poor management.

Pay, benefits, culture you name it. During the 4 years I worked as an adjuster, my opinions were always listened to, my ideas were sometimes implemented. I was promoted, got a bigger cubicle, and eventually went to working from home. Progressive will invest a lot of time and effort training you and treating you well. They really trust you and give you a lot of independence. Leaving hurt, but I had to do it for my mental health.
","The company has been growing too quickly for the past two years, and has not staffed up to meet that. When I started, the job would be 35 hours a week in the slow times, and 50 hours a week during the busy times of year, and 40 hours most of the time. Its gotten to the point where everyone is always in the office, often late at night and on Saturdays. When you do that for a couple of years in a salaried position, you eventually feel taken advantage of. I think burnout is widespread in a lot of departments in the company. And if you ever get tired of handling claims, you don't have a lot of internal options, as unless you move to corporate HQ, claims is all there is.

They do not even know they are doing a claim process wrong until someone else points out their supervisor mistake. Supervisors should be assigned someone over them to check their process. Some supervisors do the bare minimum while others go beyond. At times it just seems like a cycle of mess being swept under the rug until they meet again.

","The customer service role was really more of a sales role. There were a lot of metrics tracked, as with any call center, but the sales conversion numbers were by far the most important to Progressive. 

A high percentage of customers called due to premium increases and there were limitations to what could be done in those situations, except spin and redirect.
Advice to Management
The Progressive recruiting/hr team should re-write their customer service job description as it is not entirely honest; sales metrics should be stressed instead of the vague language that is currently used in their job requirements. 

Progressive could easily decrease their customer contacts, escalations and churn if they’d simply loosen up some of their overly-strict guidelines.

I worked at Progressive Insurance full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Profit sharing at the end of the year, work from home option is helpful due to the horrible Austin traffic. Intelligence and diversity of the employees. Pay rate. Honed soft skills from defending insurance policy practices.
Cons
Profits over customers but it's veiled in a passive aggressive way. Performance based scheduling made the call volume and stress level burdensome for later hour reps. Metrics cannot be calculated, at all, due to being ""mixed adjusted"" yet these numbers dictate your work schedule which in turn affects your life balance. Which encourages gaming behavior. Early shift reps take less calls and frequently leave early, which games the metric based merit system. But it looks good on reports. Work from home reps are ignored unless there is an issue with a metric.
Advice to Management
I wondered how many days unreported days I could miss before anyone would notice. 7 days and no call from my supervisor. And another week or so before the days off were even questioned. Value your employees as people and not just metric makers.

The pay and incentives are decent, but only if the company does well, it’s all based on gainshare. Access and openness to management all the way up is incredible.
","Not so great work life balance. Customers are abusive and inappropriate on the phone and a supervisor basically said you should suck it up and sell the policy, the focus is on growth and increasing profitability not employee experience. They pride themself on transparency and integrity, but I have seen others be intentionally misled from the interview process, to the promotion process and so on. The work is mindless and requires very little skill. Hitting your numbers is very important even though you’ll hear that “it is the behaviors that we care about, your numbers will follow along” you’re encouraged to basically bully customers in to buying the policy to hit the numbers. The company is so focused on solving the immediate problem they often create a worse problem down the road by fixing today’s problem.

If you want to re-locate all over the country all the time, you can move up the ladder pretty fast. Training facilities are pretty cool.
","Television ads promote price not service. You may wonder why many claimants get stuck with 10 or 15% fault with a claim here when clear fault lies with an Insured. You can guess why that happens (I won't disclose how or why, as that may be considered as ""confidential""). They treat customers, body shops and anyone who has a difference of opinion like complete garbage. I drove over 4 hours every day, working 12 hours every day with no paid overtime and micro managed. There were some areas in the country that it was better working conditions, but overall, it is a company who run as far from the golden rule as they can despite what they will tell you. I likely would have been diagnosed as clinically depressed. I am so blessed that I escaped that company and found greener pastures. Parts usage is a joke here. Repair times are a joke. Cycle time is a joke and includes weekends. I was told to tell body shops that the large jobs will soak up the cycle time of the small jobs where a 4 hour job on a friday dropoff needs to be done on friday, per the system. I would receive spreadsheets of network shop results statewide, and nearly every shop statewide would be in the red. The shops were the problem, not the expectations. The dollar is valued first and foremost, people are on the bottom of the value system here. While I made a lot of money in those 12 years and may have boosted my financial success in life, it was a career waste. If you are seeking a company with ethics, integrity, morals or other worthy attributes, look elsewhere. Also, their HR department is management support and that is all. HR here is strictly against employees and you will lose every time.

-Politics are king here. Follow the “Progressive Way” or... well leave.

I worked at Progressive Insurance full-time for less than a year
Pros
Great benefits with generous time off, very casual dress code, and a welcoming and dynamic company culture.
Cons
I worked in the inbound call center and the job is rough. Calls come in non-stop and customers are often irate, but that’s common for a call center. Progressive is a truly wonderful company so my advice would be: don’t apply to be in customer service or sales in the inbound call centers, apply for another position and work your way up from there.

Yes, in many cases faster is better, as far as quickly resolving and closing the claim so the customer can get on with their lives, but each case is different. An employee with less than perfect metrics may still very well be better than the inexperienced, recent college grads that you seem so intent on hiring and promoting. Your managers tend to play favorites. Also, a person who may participate in ERG's and other office events, doesn't make them a better or more qualified employee. Treat your employees better than the customers, and in turn your customers will end being treated just as well. Motivation and a positive environment is critical.

You will often feel on the verge of a mental breakdown due to the sheer amount of work you are given. They always focus on what they perceive as what you didn't do right. Unwritten expectation is to come early, skip lunch and work late. Failing to do so will have them complaining you are not efficient, instead of understanding that one person can only do so much.

","This is a call center, so you recieve constant attacks from customers which is to be expected, what is not expected is the attacks you receive from management as well. All supervisors play favoritism, and if you are not sucking up to them or trying to befriend them they target you directly. They claim to high a high turnover rate because people leave on their own, but that’s a lie. The company as a whole has too strict of an attendance policy. I understand if people were missing work repetitively for no reason, but they don’t excuse any absence and it counts as an “occurance” against you no matter if you miss 15 mins or the entire shift which counts negatively towards you keeping your job. The training for this job claims to be very in depth but they provide you with little to know information for weeks and then drop you into the environment and expect you to know what you’re doing. They spend the entire first week of being hired there in training attempting you to drink the Progressive kool-Aid, stating that the company is diverse, ethical, and everyone has an open-door policy but that is also a lie. You will be represented for everything you can imagine. They also lie in your interview, the job postings, and the first few weeks of training by omission by leaving out the fact that a huge part of your job is upselling home insurance without a license and if you don’t meet their metrics you will be let go. They expect you to upsell the home insurance no matter what the customers situation, even if they’re calling to report a 5 car pile up they were a part of or if they’re calling to remove a driver due to death, it’s immoral and unethical and when you bring it up they preach to you that it’s not “selling” insurance, it’s “educating the customer,” but then instruct you how to “overcome the customers objectives” which is a textbook sales technique. The agents who sell the insurance can’t do their jobs correctly so you’re constantly fixing their mistakes (often illegal ones) while being berated by a customer. The advancement within the company is minimal. Working here is not work your sanity or time putting up with not only the customers but the horrible supervisors and managers.

","When you're getting 9/8 claims a day, it can be stressful. Especially, when you're handling all aspects of the claim: coverage, liability, repairs etc. Then its the nature of the claim itself: complexity. Whereas in CCU, they don't handle complex claims. If you're a 4:30 rep, and get assigned a claim at 3:57 (intersection), the expectation is that claim needs to be worked thoroughly before you leave. Its no surprise, Progressive has grown rapidly in the last 3yrs. So had resulted in a increased workload. However, not everyone took to that workload lightly. Management was telling the best of the best, if you can't handle it, maybe this isn't the job for you! I WAS SHOCKED. They were telling this, to the same reps that were driving their metrics. All in all, workplace morale is at an all-time low. Nobody wants to be or work in the office.

","Do not believe them when they say that people walk themselves out and that is why the turnover is so high. The turnover is high because the good workers realize that in Austin, you can find a way better job where you are treated like a human. 

Supervisors play favoritism. They do promote that you can advance your career here, but unless you are a favorite of your supervisor, you're not advancing. Supervisors refuse to answer questions but instead just refer you to the ""guidelines"" even if its not in there or you do not understand it. 

You take an average of 80-100 calls back to back a day mostly of people yelling at you because their insurance rates are going up and then are expected to ask them multiple times to buy homeowners insurance in the same call. If you do not ask them more than 2 times in a call, than you fail on the metric. 

My Supervisor would constantly not be there and get angry if you asked a question while he was there. He would always brag about working there for 20 years, but did not know how to do the job. His answer for everything was either “send an email to assist” or “go look at guidelines”. He would never take the time to explain or work with me. How am I expected to do a job when my so called leader couldn't/wouldn't do the job? He would only meet with with me once every couple of months and during those meeting, he spend the entire meeting puting me down for not having a higher metric even though I was above goal. He only cared about how he looked in front of his management. He would often take his favorites off the phone and let them sit at his desk for hours without taking a call so they could protect their metrics. After I talked to HR about his behavior, he would use firing as a motivator every chance. Eventually, when I was ready to put my two week notice in, he advised that I could ""Just leave now, progressive will go on without you”.

","Where do I start? Managers are disrespectedful and will talk to you like a child. You don't recieve adequate support or training. Recruiters will lie and tell you there is work from home options and that you are rewarded based off performance. Progressive is not performance based it's all based off who likes you, favoritism and discrimination.You recieve unorganized, unstructured training. You have to deal with verbal abuse from customers,coaches, supervisors and directors. You handle between 80-90 calls in 1 day that leave you mentally and physically exhausted. No time for huddles with your team or people around you since you are chained to your phone. Performance is never enough nor rewarded. They will sabotage the great performers and prevent you from growth within the company. The worst experience ever to say the least. Very high turnover. If you enjoy being told no to career progression and oppurtunity as well as being lied to discriminated on and sabotaged you will fit right in with the Progressive culture.

Company wants you to do well, so they invest a lot in training and trying to get the right people. Great team of people to work with.
","Work load is soul crushing. Work life balance does not exist, 60+ hour work weeks common. You will work through lunches, stay late, and still take work home. Staffing seems to be a very big problem, people are not replaced after promotions even though though numbers and profits are increasing. Very steep learning curve for trainees and newbies.
Advice to Management
Expecting adjusters to handle 10 new claims a day on top of previous diaries, taking available calls, and assisting with the claims of others during calls off/time off is not realistic. Morale and loyalty are the first to go when conditions do not ever seem to improve. Big emphasis on customer service makes customers are merely metrics and numbers. Being expected to push a network shop on a customer that is 30+ miles away is not good customer service. The business model is there however there needs to be a little more common sense added to the mix.

Sun Jul 22 2018,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Great place for a career,13,"This is an outstanding company to work for. There’s so much opportunity for anyone who puts their heart into what they do here. Training is extensive and there’s a lot to learn, but you have plenty of support and coaching to help you along your way. Benefits are really good and there’s plenty of companies that offer discounts to Progressive employees for a ton of different products and services. There’s a lot of growth and expansion in the company right now. If you can get into this company and want to make it a career, do it!

During busy peak season, there are constant opportunities to work overtime and they encourage employees to sign up by offering gift cards and raffles for really nice prizes. Senior leadership will walk around a few times a month and pass out treats and snacks. They really are grateful for the hard work the reps are providing. They’ve all worked their way up from the bottom and know what you’re going through.

I also like how they recognize promotions, anniversaries, and advancements as well as send hand-written thank you notes to the reps for all their hard work

Large call volume can make you feel a little overwhelmed at times and there are a lot of customers to assist, but you just need to remember to take it one call at a time, one policy at a time.

I don’t understand how others can comment negatively about Progressive. Perhaps they work for an agent’s office and not the actual carrier? I’ve never been treated negatively by anyone at this company, (coworkers or management), I’ve never felt talked down to, I’ve never felt micro-managed. Others who complain about feeling overloaded with work must not remember to take things one step at a time. Those who complain about being micro-managed must not be open to coaching and helpful suggestions to help their service skills. People who say it’s hard to move around or up in this business must not realize that you have to show you’re the right candidate for the position you want. They won’t just place someone in a position because that person wants it… they must have the skills, personality, and resume to back up that application. That’s how this company has done so well for so long.

There are also some who complain about not having a work/life balance at Progressive. Again, I don't know where they get that from. They strongly discourage you from taking anything home for extra review/study and want you to keep work at work. They never tell you to take work home with you, even if you work from home.

If you remember to take it one call at a time, one policy at a time, are open to coaching and improvement opportunities, and keep a mentality of providing service to others, you’ll do really well here. If you’re looking for “just a job,” you’ll want to look somewhere else.

Good benefits
Flexible schedule/Work from home (until this was arbitrarily taken away)
Young and energetic staff
Excellent and thorough training
","1. Terrible Management. It’s difficult to express how terrible the supervisors are in such a short space. 

2. Constantly Changing Policies. Change can be good and it’s good to be able to be adaptive and “progressive.” However, it’s not good to arbitrarily change things like highlighting the flexibility and work-from-home aspect of a position and then deciding it would be an in-office position and only giving employers a few weeks notice.

3. Unrealistic Workload. The volume of the work you are expected to complete is unrealistically high. Supervisors hinder your progress instead of assisting you. Upper management raves about how much growth there is and at the same time, they refuse to hire additional people to help and pretend that the workload hasn’t increased.

4. Discriminatory Hiring and Advancement Policies. During my time in the Tennessee office, I saw racial discriminatory hiring practices. There is enough evidence there that Progressive would have a very difficult time fighting a lawsuit. There is also an argument to be made for age discrimination as well as most of the employees are young. There are virtually no older employees. 

5. All of the “best work place” activities and “best company culture” is just talk and is just for show. Your immediate supervisor will spend most of their time planning games to play, “diversity” day activities (which is comical since Progressive doesn’t have a diverse work staff), or an after-hours bar trip instead of actually working or assisting you with your work. You are then expected to bring in food for a potluck, play games for an hour or two and then you’re chastized when your work for the day isn’t completed.

Ultimately, I left because the supervisors were so terrible. I have never worked in an environment that had such terrible supervisors. The majority of them were lazy, unintelligent and vindictive.

IF upper management doesnt like you, youre out! 
They say they hire from within but you'll likely be within a job for YEARS before you are promoted 
Job is tough , answering calls, emails, skype messages and voicemails, its very stressful
Very high turnover rate, they always need more people and people always quit, (example the day i put in my notice 3 other people did also ) 
Heavy work load - you'll likely work 10 hour shifts 2-3 times a week (with no extra pay) to cover the workload
You will be graded by surverys! If a customer is upset about the value of their vehicle or what have you, and they give you a bad survey you will go through all the things you could've done better, regardless of if you technically did anything wrong
