","Very poor management with very little desire to keep you well informed on the job. New projects are rolled out with little to no warning for clients and employees. Before the pandemic there was an extremely high turnover rate. Employees in all departments find the workload unmanageable and overtime is rarely given to help employees catch up. 

There seems to be a constant air of desperation and confusion. Massive and continuous IT problems make it extremely difficult to perform your job and the infrastructure is 20 years out of date. All departments are short staffed and hiring decisions do not reflect company needs. Overall there seems to be little concern on putting the needs of the clients first by upper management.
Advice to Management
There is way too much micromanaging. Management is very strict, corporate, and and there is lots of bureaucracy. There appears to be no effort made to ensure employees get any personal enjoyment out of their jobs or to make the environment fun and inviting. There also appears to be no interest in actual critical feedback. Upper management would do a lot better to hear out employee and client concerns and drop the air secrecy about everything. Management only wants yes-men.

","Where to begin? First off, if managers are leaving a review to bolster ratings, they should be a bad sign to everyone. Things have been going from bad to worse over the past several years. Here’s some lowlights:

You are expected to to work nonstop. There’s maybe 1/3 of the amount of people working in roles and departments compared to what’s really needed.

Abbott could care less about you as a person. This was made abundantly clear in their COVID-19 response. They forced everyone back to the office and take attendance daily. There were no exceptions for employees who’s elderly parents live with them, schools not being open, sickly family members, etc. 

An entire team, people that had been with the company for over 10 years, were ambushed with their termination. They were fired because a higher -up executive didn’t like them. 2 of those people were over 60. All during a pandemic. It’s shameful and disturbing.

Tue Nov 03 2020, Human Resources,"Abbott Park, IL",Current Employee ,Abbott appears to be a great company to work for....,5,"The brand name of working for Abbott. Decent 401K match.
","Abbott overall lacks much culture. Working for the company looks great from the outside looking in. Benefits are decent, no employee health programs like gym reimbursement, etc. There is little growth, everyone works extra long hours, are expected to do 1.5 to 2 people’s worth of work. The morale is low because everyone works unhealthy hours to meet goals and expectations, there’s little acknowledgement for your hard work, employees do not feel appreciated. There are no bonuses to be awarded for hard work. The turnover is high, it’s a revolving door. Leaders get promoted for who they know or rub elbows with. You can be one of the hardest working person on your team and not be recognized, awarded or promoted. The divisions are miserable and sites lacking structure.

My specific group leader is incompetent and leads by emotion. He expects our team to work every weekend, juggle 2 people’s worth of work, 65+ hours, little resources to complete your task. I have seen team members fired not for lack of performance but more if he does not like you, or if one has a difference of opinion that isn’t favorable to his own advancement. He is insecure and looks out for himself because he realizes his role is in jeopardy. If questioned, he will never defend his team or have his support, if it doesn’t work to his own self-interest. The team morale is low in the group, little encouragement, empowerment or teamwork. I’ve seen superstars in the group fired because they do not fit the Abbott ‘culture’ without coaching. You work for Abbott one day and gone the next, typical Abbott culture.

Thu Oct 08 2020,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,N/A,1,"It’s not outdoor construction,solid benefit plan, has a pretty awesome range of products that make people’s lives better which makes it better than working for banks making money off of fees, cafeteria staff are really nice
","**this is specific to my former team only**Any company is really just as good as the five people you spend the most time with. As a new grad you will be surrounded by boomers who are stuck in their ways and show no sign of modernizing quick enough for your skills to match any competitive market. The location is horrendous and meeting rooms feel like coffins (10x10 rooms with 9 grown men rebreathing each other’s breath isn’t pleasant). The pay doesn’t match the cost of living in the Chicagoland area and raises are a joke where you are told to write your own performance review of yourself. Additionally, if you’re ahead of schedule and objectively meeting goals you aren’t congratulated but instead given arbitrary tasks to complete. Even if objectively meeting goals, management (just one person I’m talking about) will start to criticize personality traits and hand out a lot of “do this because I said so” type of tasks that never get used to test your patience. People will throw others under the bus constantly. There is an arbitrary yearly goal system where three to four goals are your main tasks for the year but management has no issue turning this into 15 items, especially if they are passive aggressive. There is a remote work policy in place but it’s arbitrarily approved and is frowned upon. The location is terrible for younger employees who want to live in the city. The buildings have mold in carpets and in ceiling tiles and you can hear people coughing constantly (not all buildings). It’s a healthcare company and 80% of employees I’ve seen are overweight and stressed out due to constantly changing priorities and poorly organized project plans (probably not unique to this company but it’s ironic considering how it’s a healthcare company).The contractors that work here are played so much with arbitrary contract extensions where contracting companies are trying to keep people hoping for full-time but put them on the contract extension wheel ( probably not unique to this company). Again, my experience is only contingent on the five people I had to spend the most time with but I don’t think these issues are unique to my former team.
Advice to Management
Make sure your management has access to proper mental health services and encourage them to utilize it. Take the time to properly establish teams based on complimentary skill sets and take time to check in on your employees overall satisfaction with their “leaders”. Make sure you hire actual leaders that other employees can reasonably model for success, not just someone with a chip on their shoulder with a tendency to assign vague tasks to see their team scramble instead of actually thinking through a solid plan with clear goals before assigning work. I’ve met other leaders in the company and they were great people.

They juggled the return to office date for months with noone knowing when it would be. Then, they mandated every employee back to the office with mandatory invasive nasal swabs every other week. Working from home had no issues in the workplace, yet they are so incredibly stubborn and privacy invasive. They even request your medical history.

Advice to Management
Learn what’s your role first - to manage people and delegate tasks. Don’t hire educated/qualified folks if you want to continue with your current management style. Don’t lie in interviews. Be transparent to candidates that you expect them to do administrative tasks. Please learn regulatory and build on management skills before you go into management! Don’t ruin others lives causing them to leave.

Advice to Management
Working at Abbott Diabetes Care is a trade-off between the excellent benefits and the oppressive imperial management and lack of advancement opportunities. Hey sure talk a great game and superficially show they care, but it’s all bread and circuses. Executive management at this division cannot execute on anything to save their souls, and they hold endless and mind-numbing meetings to harangue staffers and blame line management for their failures. Add into this an extremely rigid 1950s type hierarchy where rank means everything and a plantation mentality. Our Director made us call him “Doctor” even in private meetings. He never bothered to even learn the names of his team. We were all just “hey you”. Salary levels low end for area and industry.

For being a medical device company it's appalling at how many people don't properly wash their hands. Strict attendance policy which normally wouldn't bother me, but if your mother gets stabbed and you have to leave to see her it'll be marked as an occurrence point against you because it's company policy. They do not care about the little man. Very, very, very corporate. Little to no room for promotion. And one supervisor in particular really enjoyed trying to boss other people in other departments, and when he couldn't get his way he'd throw a fit and complain to that departments supervisor how their employees aren't listening to him. My advice? Avoid 2nd shift Final Pack and CVD departments.

","- Management has limited communication and slow decision making. They have a ""get it done"" to make deadlines mentality, and often poor engineering and decisions are made, which ends up rearing its ugly head at us, both financially and time-wise. 
- Promotion seems arbitrary; instead of promoting qualified colleagues, they have moved the goal post, and then hire externally. Conversely, I've seen peers promoted to staff or management positions after they flopped at leading a project or managing a new process. THere is no transparent measure for promotion, and there is no obvious way to provide cross-functional feedback besides directly asking the management. 
- Even in the midst of a pandemic, I do not get a sense the company cares about the livelihood of its employees. ""Built as if intended for my family"" is the motto, but management does not act like there is semblance of a family or community that cares for one another. It took more than 2 weeks of increasingly serious news about COVID-19 for the company to issue notice about cleanliness and potentially working from home. When such news happens, responses should be in terms of days, not weeks. Good management requires frequent communication, even if the initial communication is not 100% accurate.

","Management shamelessly lies to prospective candidates during interviews about opportunities, culture, and your ACTUAL JOB. 
- JOB DESCRIPTION- Everyone gets told that they will be working on regulatory tasks that involve using your brain, and this is consistent with their job description. But, once you are onboarded you soon realize that your job is primarily composed of two things: 
1) being a labeling technician or coordinator who manually implements labeling for multiple products for all countries and all languages. That's right! They will have you vouch for labeling in languages that you don't know. To add to your misery, all Abbott Vascular products are from the jurassic period, so they are already registered in hundreds of countries. Now, your job is to manually ensure that you post the right IFU version in the right language(s) for all the right countries. So that's X products x say 267 countries... you do the misery math. Even though this is your primary job function, management refuses to add it to the job description or disclose it during the interview process. 
2) being a glorified assistant who performs printing, scanning, notarizing, stamping, and shipping of documents for global regulatory requests. This is basically a high school interns job, but at Abbott Vascular.. this is performed by the regulatory specialists and project managers. Again, they conveniently keep forgetting to disclose this during the interview.

OPPORTUNITIES- If you are able to adequately suck up to management by taking on event planning & travel scheduling tasks and staying for several years (because maybe you are on a work visa?), then you may get to put your name on an actual regulatory submission. However, you will not be authoring the submission. LOL. Management will ask you to send the submission template to the engineers for doing the regulatory writing. So you will basically learn no useful skills for your next job. 

CULTURE: the toxicity is as contagious as COVID-19. Oh, and by the way Abbott wouldn't let us Work From Home during a pandemic and a national emergency caused by this coronavirus. 
The 3 pillars of toxicity include:
- Unprofessional conduct: the long time Abbott employees seem to have no training in regard to proper conduct at work.
- ""clicks"" based on ethnicity: If you are a white man here... phew! good luck!...unless you can join our bollywood dance troop at work? In other words, the diversity in RA is embarrassing. 
- Work visas: what better way to have a hostage work force that will keep its heads down for the sake of maintaining their visa status? Also, why is our government giving skilled worker visas to do an admin's job?

","Poor training, no collaboration or positive encouragement among team, management is virtually non existent and does not listen when problems arise and they set the tone for the negative culture by speaking poorly about all of their employees to other employees
Advice to Management
Become team oriented, make sure everyone is trained equally and well, do not let your employees dictate negative work culture among each other - it's not High School(popularity club)- treat everyone fairly, speak and listen to all of your employees vs basing decisions on gossip and hear say, stop gossiping about others as well, maybe your team will follow your example, and get sales up so there is work (cases) - never say this is the busiest we have ever been - especially when it is slow in a highly populated territory and only have 3-4 cases a week on average.

Majority of coworkers were fantastic and developed lasting relationships
","There's no accountability for management. No management reviews, no exit interviews. There's no place to express your needs/concerns without having to open a full-blown complaint with HR, and people are too scared of the consequences to open the complaint because of managers' passive aggressive reactions to feedback.
Managers pretend to have your career growth in mind and lead you on (breadcrumbing) with vague ""growth opportunities"". In a few cases, a singular opportunity was offered to multiple people during respective 1:1s. When questioned about timelines, managers continue to avoid giving a direct answer (i.e. ""soon""). You're told ""you're doing everything you could be doing and more"", leaving you helpless and in limbo indefinitely. Managers will claim that the situation is beyond their control (which very well may be true) but you expect your boss to go to bat for you regardless of the situation.
Compensation is also grossly inequitable, as management will hire someone with an accomplished resume at a considerably higher rate, rather than promoting/give a raise to a veteran employee who has worked 12 hour days for 5+ years and has exhibited mastery of the role. Managers continue to ignore the disparity as the workflow suffers from demotivated employees and inexperienced new hires. 
New hire training also falls on coworkers rather than management. The unofficial trainer is volun-told to create the training material without a change in their job description, and is still expected to complete their own work.
If you plan on taking any PTO, you're expected to complete your vacation-length's amount of work before leaving, effectively defeating the purpose of vacation.

Hold some basic management training. Management 101 is: Support your team, ALWAYS.

","The upper management continuously acknowledges the significant issues with morale, waning confidence in company, regressing compensation, training deficiencies, and lack of upper mobility confidence. They promise change and improvements in order to placate the masses, but things stay the same or get worse. More good people are continuing to leave because the faith is gone. Names on office doors can change- but nothing else does. Employees are making less money while tasked with more, opportunities for advancement are earmarked for upper management's friends while truly talented people are not given opportunity. Employees have been pushed out when they have raised concerns or ""challenged"" upper management, not allowed to transfer to other divisions because of spite, targeted because of raising concerns, or threatened termination/terminated for reasons that do not seem ethical and seem manufactured. People are fearful of retaliation when bringing up concerns because they have seen first hand what the culture is. The terms ""keep your head down"" and ""don't call attention"" are used way to often -when they should be influenced instead to speak up and share ideas. ""targeting"" has been seen and witnessed way too often and it is a shame that this is being communicated to both new and tenured employees. This used to be a company that people never wanted to leave and coveted to be able to work for. The current culture is one of fear, uneasiness, and doubt.

People are very friendly. North burbs of Chicago are very low cost of living compared to nearby areas of other larger cities on either coast.
","Politics - to set in the ways of doing everything the ""Abbott"" way, or the ""way it's always been done."" Abbott almost never has real turnover for those who have been with the company for 5+ years so the more tenured IC's or low-mid managers have no current/relevant skills to speak of. This makes integrating new technology or new business processes akin to moving a mountain even if it's for very simple tools.

Another major con is career advancement although for me it wasn't too bad. Often at Abbott career advancement means waiting in a ""queue"" and is rarely tied to actual marketable industry skills or even personal accomplishments. The lack of cut-throat or performance-based advancement could be a positive for some but for those early-career professionals looking to make a name for themselves this can be very deflating.

Compensation is also on the low end for the Chicago area - might be due to the attractive side benefits.
Advice to Management
If Abbott wants to become a healthcare + ""technology"" company, it needs to start behaving like one.

Fri Aug 23 2019, Director,"Santa Clara, CA",Current Employee ,Analyze carefully before you join,12,"Competitive Package: base salary, bonus (only for management level and above except in premium markets), long term incentives (manager level and above).

Top notch benefits such as multiple Health Insurance options with no monthly premium, vacation buy program, unlimited sick pay for exempt employees, care coordinators, limited maternity and paternity leave (better than the standard but not as competitive as other big companies), among others.

Long standing reputation and stock price growing very nicely...what’s not to love about it, right?
","1.Leadership: Probably it’s biggest gap. Chicago is very disconnected from the reality in the field. You will not get to ever see the CEO - he’s very well ranked externally but is not an inspirational or culture driven leader. No clear sense on the Company’s vision for the future or the culture the company is looking to build. Very old school in his thinking. He’s due for retirement, although his successor’s leadership and abilities are yet to be put to the test and there’s not a lot of confidence he’ll drive a positive change in culture. Company highly oriented to financial/business results, which has produced a long standing reputation and high yield in its stock price. However, with the lack of communication related to the vision, lack of culture strategy, and extremely poor integration work with the new companies, the question is how long will these good returns continue. Leadership in certain divisions move (or are moved) at such a high pace so constant change in strategy and direction confuses people and has driven turnover in some areas. 

2.Infraestructure: Organization is very top heavy, bureaucratic, and slow to move, with limited resources to support the everyday work. Outdated and non connected systems make the most simple data requests a challenge and are highly people dependent - each employee defines the way to manage processes, creating lots of variability and inefficiencies. Constant last minute fires requiring data validation generating big administrative burden. Lack of clarity related to how to measure goals and metrics resulting in constant re-do of analysis and differences in how divisions measure results.

3. Human Resources: Lack of strong HR leadership or strategy. Very old school as well and stuck in the old way of doing HR. Employee benefits can vary by division and legacy teams from integrated companies do not get the same pay as benefits as Abbott employees (ex. Bonus targets or pension) causing big tension and dissatisfaction as they make less money than Abbott employees. Force ranking performance system does not foster collaboration nor is it objective because goales do not tend to be very well aligned at the beginning of the year, so ends up driving loss of morale. No employee surveys or culture initiatives. Lack of listening to employee opinions or how it impacts morale. 

4. Workforce: Highly tenured workforce, not the best place for millenial and early talent. Many long standing Abbott employees who have not moved with the changes in direction, remain in their roles due to grandfathered pension benefits and high pay, generate loss of productivity, increase in workload for other newer team members and high dismotivation. Some of them block good talent to be promoted.

5. Offices: Many old buildings and facilities across the affiliates. Your experience will highly depend on where you end up located. Capital investment is managed tightly so expect to work in old outdated buildings with a decor that was stuck in the 80’s or early 90’s not very inspiring.

It is very important for a company this large to present itself as a high-quality place to work instead of simply presenting the illusion that it is. There are many opportunities for improvement, but also a lot of pessimism that these opportunities will ever be realized.

Sun May 05 2019, Front Line Leader,"Sturgis, MI",Current Employee ,Good people held back from excellence by burnout and turnover.,3,"Pay and benefits are great for the Sturgis, MI area. This is also a great place to get experience since they have such a hard time getting and retaining staff; your self driven educational opportunities are pretty much endless. 

There is a lot of soft skills and concepts training available; from leadership development to excel classes to health and fitness and even stress/burnout management. There is little support for the implementation of these skills, but most companies don’t even offer the training, so this is a big plus.

Being part of a larger global company with multiple divisions, there is incredible growth and travel opportunity if someone were inclined and in a position to commit themselves.
","Hard skills training from experienced people is hard to come by here. The group has succeeded by the skin of its teeth for many decades and prides itself on scrappiness, hard work, and long hours. I repeat, long hours.

This has caused poor work/life balance, operational inefficiencies, and burnout. When people can leave or retire, they do so as quickly as they can. This leads to poor retention rate of talent that is able to effectively train new generations as well as a purging of experience that can leverage their knowledge to implement long term solutions that would fix the aforementioned problems.

A great place to be able to afford a family, they need to give their employees the time to be able to raise one though.

Dying branch of Pharma Abbott 


This was such a great place to work. There was a sense of pride and loyalty that made working at AN feel like an honor. There are still many white hat employees that maintain an uncompromising approach to their work but are often silenced or punished by management for being honest or when trying to do the right thing. 

Lately, metrics are most important and although management says quality and safety are top priority I saw an obvious trend of compromise. The “special culture” there is another way of saying it is impossible to grow unless you have someone above pulling for you. 

The atmosphere can be toxic if you get the wrong boss. Management is often through fear and intimidation and albeit subtle, they impact trust and ultimately employee loyalty. Bully Bosses thrive here and if you’re under one it can cost you your health, your marriage and your sense of self worth. 

The culture can vary greatly from sister sites and even by department. Many employees that are badly mistreated by one boss will excel just by moving to another department. 

This can still be a great place work if you have the right boss. The people there are some of the best you will find anywhere.

","Extremely hierarchical - the people who are promoted / running the show are the people who were able to stand or thrive in the toxic culture for more than a few years. They believe their title will command respect and admiration, not their competency or ability to lead. Most people director level or higher have been there in the same role for 18+ years, have never worked for another company and they have no desire to keep up with the times or improve. They maintain job security through secrecy and back stabbing and holding others down. Several Leaders and HR professionals plainly stated that this is not a Learning Company - you will not develop, there is little outside training, no leadership training and no desire to keep up with any business trends outside of Abbott. 

The leadership rules by fear, bullying and outright abuse. Innovation is punished as you are expected to do what they say, without challenging the way things have always been done. Goals are established to check the boxes with little or no strategy, and little to no value add. Leadership believes the way to improve results is to squeeze the life out of their employees by demanding more without any meaningful improvements to products, processes or resources. The more productive/talented you are, the more work they pile on you without promotion or even minimal acknowledgement. If you have a life or a family this is not the company for you. If you value your health and well being this is also not the company for you.


They frequently and blatantly discriminate against women and are not inclusive, in fact I would argue that not one person in HR has any diversity and inclusion training or expertise.

Collaboration is unheard of - departments fight among themselves, and focus on blaming, shaming and finger pointing when profit goals are missed.

The leadership runs the company like a bunch of middle school mean girls, except they are all middle aged white men.

Executive management takes great pride in the amount of work they give to people, this is a part of the culture. Think long and hard before taking a job here. Is the extra money worth the stress the organization will put on you?

Almost immediately, Abbott acquired St Jude Medical and that is how wound up working for Abbott. I was very impressed with the efficiency at which Abbott destroyed the place. Most original top performers and good managers left within the first year. The only ""Pro"" to speak of is that these acquisitions just about tripled the value of my original Thoratec RSUs.
","Abbott management is very abrasive and condescending. As I mentioned above, many people left or were pushed out but they were not replaced. Abbott management expected/demanded that the work get absorbed by those remaining. Many people are doing the work of two or three with no additional compensation. In some cases, workers were expected to take on the work of their departed manager without additional compensation or even a title upgrade.

It appears their business model as it relates to quality has four steps*: 1) cut cut cut costs obsessively for two years. 2) Earn an FDA warning letter 3) spend $ millions remediating two years worth of work 4) repeat

* (for abbott lawyers, this is just my opinion and nothing more. Any appearance of disclosing trade secret is purely coincidental)

Abbott plasters posters around their facilities reminding employees to think of patients that use their devices as if they were members of their family. Well, my advice is to regard EMPLOYEES like they were part of your family and treat them a little better. Common respect for employees is lacking.

Seriously, you need to stop sending those emails. They were annoying.

- Opportunity to work with talented and intellectual co-workers: Many of these people will leave the company due to the absence of creativity and intellectual conversation in the workplace.

- Great resume builder and catalyst for future positions: This is of upmost importance as you will be leaving the position within 1-3 years and other prospective companies will reach out to you with employment opportunities.
","- Work/Life Balance = Non-existent
- Upper Management = Political Nightmare
- Corporate Mentality= Profit over People
- Culture = Fake
- Stress = 24/7
Advice to Management
I wanted to be as fair as possible when writing this review to help future prospective employees understand what is truly means to work at Abbott Nutrition. If you want to be a number on a piece of paper, with no influence or creative control of your job, then working with Abbott Nutrition is the right place for you. And this may apply to many prospective employees who want to embrace this corporate mentality. However, I warn you. Isolation and deterioration of one's own personal freedom and creativity does more harm than good. To work for a company that promotes ""Life to the Fullest"" but restricts all life from its employees is quite contradictory. And while the benefits and compensation of the company are exceptional, your work becomes your life and your life, outside of work, becomes non-existent.

My advice to management is to look closer at the finite details of the company and take a moment to step away from PowerPoint presentations. People are what make a company successful. This has been lost over the past couple of years within Abbott Nutrition. Unfortunately, one of the worst parts of working at Abbott Nutrition is the current culture. What exists currently is no different than that of a Fraternity. The mentality of ""see something, say nothing"" and ""I have power over you and you can do nothing or say anything to counter my decisions and actions."" is childish and creates rifts in company culture and employee dissatisfaction. 

Many of the employees that work for Abbott are smart, creative and selfless. Upper management needs to welcome these talented individuals and give them freedom to run their business or turnover will continue at a high rate.

To work for a company that promotes ""Life to the Fullest"" but restricts all life from its employees is quite contradictory. And while the benefits and compensation of the company are exceptional, your work becomes your life and your life, outside of work, becomes non-existent.

My advice to management is to look closer at the finite details of the company and take a moment to step away from PowerPoint presentations. People are what make a company successful. This has been lost over the past couple of years within Abbott Nutrition. Unfortunately, one of the worst parts of working at Abbott Nutrition is the current culture. What exists currently is no different than that of a Fraternity. The mentality of ""see something, say nothing"" and ""I have power over you and you can do nothing or say anything to counter my decisions and actions."" is childish and creates rifts in company culture and employee dissatisfaction. 

Many of the employees that work for Abbott are smart, creative and selfless. Upper management needs to welcome these talented individuals and give them freedom to run their business or turnover will continue at a high rate.

","Abbott Nutrition is a great stepping stone for any young professional looking to open more job opportunities elsewhere. I would not recommend Abbott as a long-term career. Upper management is clueless and promotions are based more upon how buddy buddy you are with the higher-ups rather than talent and ability. Hard-working employees are often overloaded with tedious, reduntant projects that carry into personal time at home. Communication across management is non-existent, so direction is usually vague, contradictory, and unproductive. Working environment can best be described as judgmental, very conservative, ""don't speak unless spoken to"", undiverse, and as being a place where creative collaboration and lower ranking employee input is not welcome. If you are lucky enough to have a non-micromanagerial manager, you will inevitably feel hindered by the unrealistic company expectations and restrictions put in place that limit employee creativity and ownership of your position. Upper management is expected to be treated like kings and queens, and dealing with miscommunication and gossip is just normal part of an average week. I used to love working for Abbott Nutrition, but this department has been moving in the wrong direction for a long time.
Advice to Management
Eliminate the fear-based environment. Create a space where lower ranking employees feel comfortable enough to voice their opinions and converse with you like normal people. Abbott is filled with many talented and intelligent employees; trust them to do their job properly or expect to lose them quickly and frequently.

","I want this review to be as honest as I can make it....Not sure why everyone is saying that pay is great because it’s not. I have never been a sales rep for a company whose at plan commission is about 22,000 a year. Not a quarter or a half, per year! And not to mention it’s only paid out twice! Sales reps should be money Monivated so to underpay then and reduce the frequency of pay is a bad formula. 
Next, everyone act like this pension is the greatest thing since sliced bread and it is if you stick with the company for 30 years. News flash, the market has changed. Most people are not going to be with on or two companies their whole life like the baby boomers. So essentially all you are doing is getting money taken out of your pay check to fund somethingg you will probably see little to none of unless you work for 15 plus years. 
Last, If you are a sales rep you will be micromanaged in to the ground. You’ll have a ride along every 2-3 weeks and calls every week. Some people will lose business because of their manager

","Leadership. I stood to make a lot of money as in January a new business model was being put in place where CS's stood to be paid on commission. I opened a new account in December that placed a huge order to be billed on January 2nd 2018. Somewhere in Mid-December my sales associate concocted some crazy story that I was on drugs. This was while I was in the hospital passing multiple kidney stones. When I returned to work, my sales associate called my wife without my knowledge and told her I was on drugs. The leadership pulled me in for a mandatory observed urine screen. The urine screen was negative for any and all drugs. Later that day my wife moved out of our home thinking I was on drugs. Abbott suspended me for 3 weeks and then fired me citing that I was not at a facility on a certain day that I was scheduled to be there- another lie. I will be suing Abbott once I get my life backj in order as they have created suchj chaos in my life it would be a disservice to let it go without punishment. My attorney is chomping at the bit to proceed. I saved every email, every text and so has my wife. I will update after abbott pays the price for discriminatory harassment.

Thu Jan 04 2018, Senior Scientist,"Des Plaines, IL",Current Employee ,For the experience,6,"Since the company is well established, it has proper design control and development procedures in place. This is useful to learn, but requires seeking of guidance to understand its value, as little of its importance is explained to you on the job. Many of my colleagues here are incredibly intelligent and competent people, who provide me with insight and guidance. However, most people would admit that they are unhappy here, which make for a less than ideal environment to persist in. Learn what you can from this experience to place yourself in a better place. Benefits (health insurance, company perks, profit-sharing, 401K match) are generous.
","Upper management has a tendency to micromanage and not trust its personnel, despite hiring top talent. Decisions are made and ordered down to scientists with little rationale or explanation. Leadership seems chaotic. Some managers are also promoted to levels beyond their capabilities, whereas competent personnel are mistreated and micromanaged, indicating a lack of meritocracy. There is very little room for career growth, as the higher management positions are saturated with some doing just enough to get by and waiting to collect their pensions. Scientists partake in technician-level tasks that require little-to-no intellectual effort. Very little innovation is integrated into the products developed here. Ideas and methodologies are stale. Roles here are very siloed, thus resulting in limited exposure to the development process as a whole. Job is not time-demanding, but due to sporadic decision-making from upper management, it may require last minute and weekend cramming to meet deadlines. While this may not be pervasive throughout, there is some culture here where people/groups function ""just enough to get the job done,"" such that when issues arise, it gets dumped on other groups. Be prepared that R&D receives little acknowledgment and credit for their efforts in bringing products to fruition, as well as trouble-shooting on-market issues--customer-facing groups (sales & marketing) often jump to take and get credit, hence the lack of meritocracy.

Wed Nov 29 2017,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Client Service Rep 3,1,"Since acquiring the business Alere, the benefits of the company's 401K match is 6% as long as you contribute up to 3 %. The opportunity to cross train and gain more knowledge about the business.
","Although you may be cross trained, you will be told that you'll be compensated, but that was not the case. You'll be advised that you have the opportunity to move up within the company, however you have to maintain a ""balance performer"" status for over a period of 3 consecutive months. Balance performer consists of meeting Quality, ACW, and hold times, attendance and busy work. I took calls from all 3 departments of customer service, employer and clinics and was not compensated nor received feedback for quality training. We went through an aggressive 2 week ""training"" period, but the majority of the role wasn't learned until we hit the floor. When we escalated calls due to lack of knowledge the senior reps would seem annoyed so I stopped escalating. There are no managers available after 5pm, so when there is a situation that requires management, we had to advise clients to call back tomorrow. Also, ""busy work"" is required of all representatives which includes keying contracts and results for donors. The busy work is based on how many contracts get keyed per hour while taking calls and in the event you are providing customer service and fall behind on your busy work, you will be chastised.
Advice to Management
For the amount of information that needs to be obtained, please extend training further than a 2 week period instead of overloading people with information and then throwing them onto the floor.

Mon Jul 31 2017,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Direct Manager's Jealousy Ruined My Abbott Career,7,"The majority of Abbott employees are respectful and genuinely care about the well-being of others.
","• Direct manager periodically harassed me about my salary during private meetings in his office. He told me that my salary was too high for my position, questioned why the company chose to pay me such a salary and openly complained that I was one of his top paid employees. My manager also said that I should learn to appreciate my current salary when I asked how I could earn a greater merit increase during an annual performance assessment. I perceived this behavior as a form of jealousy.
• Company does NOT follow its own standard disciplinary procedures outlined in Corporate Human Resources policies. Counseling services, performance improvement plans and probation are swiftly bypassed when it is convenient for management.
• Company does NOT follow its own standard employee problem solving procedures outlined in Corporate Human Resources policies. Conflict resolution between employees either directly or with management as an arbitrator is discouraged so that Employee Relations can get involved and escalate the severity of the situation.
• Company denied me a severance package upon terminating my job
• Company refused to bridge my pension upon terminating my job just weeks prior to vesting.
• Company assigned its own employee as the independent, third-party reviewer for my job termination appeal. This employee's relationship with my direct manager led him to immediately dismiss my appeal. 
• Company retaliated against me by appealing my unemployment benefits eligibility with the Workforce Commission. However, after company could not prove allegations and even failed to appear for its own appeal hearing, the WC affirmed my unemployment benefits eligibility.
• Company refused to negotiate a settlement with my attorney once again citing allegations it could not prove. It threatened to publicly smear my name and counter-sue me for attorney's fees should I ever file a lawsuit.
