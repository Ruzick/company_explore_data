","Like previous reviews here, low pay, long hours, and no respect for the work you do as the Old Boy mentality is all that matters. Join this company and go nowhere, keep your voice low as loud talking and socializing is not allowed. Got a cell phone? Then you’ll have issues.

This is a company right out of dark ages. Many employees have been here over 35 yrs, a time when “Help Wanted Female” was acceptable.

Be very careful accepting employment here especially if you are leaving a current job. They have no scruples about recruiting an employed person then letting them go if they just don’t like you. There is a high probability that you will be fired within a few weeks for no reason even days before Christmas. Got a long resume, degrees, tons of experience?

Not sure how things are now, but even if they pay per industry standard, I do not recommend working for this company.

Promising talent has either left or looking to leave due to lack of deserved promotions, discrimination, low pay, too much work and bad work environment. 

Employee motivation is at its lowest. Company wide, the same people get promoted and share the pie.

Wed Oct 18 2017,Anonymous,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Stuck in yesteryear - in dire need of house cleaning,7,"Numerous ""smart"" employees with vast amounts of problem solving abilities and ""think outside the box"" approaches to daily tasks and troubleshooting scenarios. In my time at the company, I encountered many employees that believed in the mission of the company and that were driven by a goal to learn and better their performance output. A majority of these employees were motivated towards vertical movement while also wanting to elevate the performance of those around them - team effort and team rewards (see cons for flip side). Most start work without a ""me"" mentality and are dedicated to the big picture.
","Management consists of individual protection silos, and a culture conducive towards ""kick the can down the road"" when it comes to employee well being and dealing with intra-company and intra-departmental issues. In my experience, team leadership was selfishly motivated as supervisors/directors appeared to place blame on employees within their group while taking credit for team contributions. 

Opportunities for vertical movement seemed stagnant within numerous teams, forcing many to form their own silo to protect their own job.

A culture that was clearly averse to accepting the changes within the modern workforce - stuck in the late 80s/early 90s when it comes to workforce mentality.

The company has a massive problem with nepotism and favoritism. 

Use of isolation tactics against ""new thinking"". 

Fully embracing of the ""good ol' boy"" culture.

Discouraging atmosphere for those looking to grow their career, and even more discouraging to young employees set on not being ""boxed in"" to a simple job title or description.

Numerous mid/upper-level managers are in dire need of corporate leadership training, as well as a fresh course on HR policies and modern day business practices. Training employees in Microsoft programs does not qualify as company sponsored training.

Extremely low base salaries = severely underpaid talent (especially given the fluid formulas used for bonus payouts - read ""change as necessary""). 

Work/Life balance sold as a pro in the interview process... this is not true based on the stories I've heard, or my experience.

Many of these ""cons"" have been ongoing for over a decade. Each passing month of accepting the status-quo is a month closer to passing the line of no return.

The company pays for metro passes if you live near a park and ride. They also pay for parking but practically force the bus on you. There were some really nice people in other departments. The company as a whole looked great and was somewhere I wanted to be for the long haul.
","My department was vicious. Everyone plots against each other, acting like best friends. Very cut throat. The gossip is vicious, profane, VERY PERSONAL, and unlike anything I've ever seen in a professional environment. They hate new people and treat them like they are disposable. Jealousy is an epidemic because everyone wants to be the center of attention and can't stand others getting recognition. If an employee doesn't like someone and the employee is a favorite, they aggressively go after the person's job, are hostile, argumentative, confrontational often yelling at the person, and lie about them to the manager. Brown nosing gets you everywhere! The manager allows it and brags about how many people have been fired. If an employee reports someone, they WILL be retaliated against. Managers and employees talk /gossip behind closed doors and managers never let the target know there is a real problem or ask for their side. They don't want new ideas and if you make the slightest mistake, management publicly ridicules you in front of your co-workers. There is no such thing as constructive feedback. One insignificant mistake will get a person fired if they're not in the group of favorites or are new. They'll never see it coming. They'd rather replace someone than work with them and make the rest of the team act like adults. I saw this happen time and time again, always the same employees, while I was there until I finally had to leave. It is truly a toxic work environment.
Advice to Management
Stay out of the gossip. You're their manager. They are your subordinates. Value new employees. Recognize cut throat behavior and do not tolerate bullying and retaliation. If someone makes a mistake the first time they do something, realize they are human. If there is a problem worth firing someone for, they should be coached privately and given an opportunity to improve. Show some respect! Upper management should really check to see how their managers are really managing their teams. When everyone is reporting each other to HR, there might be a problem!! When there are screaming matches happening at people's desks, a manager is failing. When a manager is constantly firing new people, it is worth looking into. That's not normal. Pay attention!!

Advice to Management
Stop micro managing and do not violate the trust of employees. Watching employees work from your pickup while it is snowing out isn't going to earn you any loyalty either. I'd take a long hard look at the Rocky Mountain District if I were the president of the company.

","They keep telling us the DRIVERS are the most important employees. The biggest ASSET to the company. So how come when the industry entered the downturn ONLY the DRIVERS took a 25% hourly pay cut, a 50% PLUS cut to our quarterly bonus, Lost almost ALL of our EXCESS LOADING and UNLOADING PAY, went from 5 on 2 off-- to 4 on 2 off, effectively cutting us from 20 pay days per month to 18 per month AND ALSO we get ONLY 1 load a day for 2 of the 4 days some pay cycles! To put it another way >$100,000.00+ a year to <$45,000.00 a YEAR AND THEY WON'T LAY ANYONE OFF! THIS FORCES YOU TO QUIT OR GO BROKE, and if you quit, they keep your last bonus (because you have to wait 2-1/2 months AFTER it is earned, before you get it!) and the $1500 they give you at sign on, so you don't even get a final paycheck.

","Tribal culture: you are either part of the tribe or not. If you are not, be ready to justify even the smallest decision that is made. 
Upper management has the tendency to dive down into insignificant level of detail simply to find a flaw that is later used as a jab against you and your performance. Upper management does not deliver compliments only critical feedback which makes it difficult to maintain a positive outlook on how you are doing.

Speed to market and lowest cost are paramount to safety and functionality for most projects. 
Action from other departments can be slow unless the request is made by a senior manager in many cases. This results in inefficiencies in execution of work which will be blamed on the individual not the system or lack of resources. 
 Strong resistance to diverse points of view to try new ideas or new service providers

A methodical approach to projects while slower always proves to be the lowest total cost option however, here the preference is to go fast, bolt on as you go and blame everyone else for why the total cost is higher than what was forecasted. 

Has a small company mentality but is now sufficiently large enough that processes need to be upgraded or changed to accommodate growth.
Advice to Management
Old management style of managing by exception is not effective in retaining top talent. Micromanagement breeds distrust in the organization thus decreasing motivation. It is okay to provide constructive feedback as long as it is justified and not in the form of an attack on the individuals previous experience. Diversity of industry experience is useful for providing a cold eye prospective to old problems. Don't discount these ideas simply because they are different from what has historically been done.

I feel respected by my VP and other senior leaders with whom I interact. My work is challenging and I am very fairly compensated. Great work atmosphere, everyone gets along well. There are always office politics, but it seems to be kept in check here. Senior execs really seem to care about the employees. Quarterly company meetings keep us informed of what is happening. Pay and benefits are very good.
","Seems like a lot of the senior execs have gotten their kids jobs here. Not enough emphasis is placed on employee evaluations, so you have to seek out feedback from your boss.

","Marketing Department has much better compensation and bonus structure than the rest of the company. This happens to be the reason that 6 out of 13 VP's have managed to get their children positions in the marketing/trading department creating issues in itself. Management is saturated with OU and TX A&M grads. When tenured professionals submit thier 2 weeks notice, they are sent home on the spot.

Plains purchased our comapny and quickly threw money at us to move to Texas. There were many openings were some of us could have filled and stayed in California. Instead they hired people from the outside filling those vacancies clearly knownig that 95% of us did not want to leave. Many good people left and others went to Texas with the intention to come back. When Plains would find out you were trying to come back they would throw more money at you. When you rip families apart money is not the answer.

Work to more actively grow employees, promote from within in order to keep the knowledge in house, instead of hiring from outside so often. Most departments seem to have too much management level, not enough employees. Departments are too lean so the workload is too heavy, yet the expectations keep increasing.
