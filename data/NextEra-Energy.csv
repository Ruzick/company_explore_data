Tue Feb 09 2021, Maintenance Engineer,"Jensen Beach, FL",Current Employee ,At the Forefront of Renewable Energy,0,"The company is always looking to improve products, services, and internal processes.
","One drawback to the company's focus on continuous improvement is the desire to accomplish the same or more work with fewer employees each year. The result is a smaller, overly stressed workforce that is challenged to produce consistently high-quality work. This feels particularly true the farther away you work from headquarters, as if your facility and business unit are an afterthought to executive leadership.
Advice to Management
If the company won't hire more people or even fill existing vacancies, then at least limit existing employees' workload to that of approximately one Full-Time Equivalent (FTE). Otherwise, work quality and productivity will continue to decline.

","There was a lot of bullying in the department I worked in. No respectful words, only narcissistic comments, scornful jokes, false rumors about everyone (except the bosses ofc, they get sucked up), and a lot of backstabbing. People are in the expectation of what the bosses do; as long as the boss treats you well, they are nice, if s/he is dismissive of you, everyone will mock you and refuse to work with you. Bosses act like they are hiding something, they are on the defensive perpetually, taking offense at each and every remark. Employees run together in little mafias that exclude one another, and on a bad day OMG... they even bully their own friends and are unacceptably aggressive to the customers. New employees are targeted and socially isolated and everyone is forced to do overtime without compensation. Worse yet, what you end up doing has nothing to do with your job description and managers have NO IDEA of what the heck they want you to do. Only apply here if you want to meet the most narcissistic, rudest, lying and inmoral people in the world.

","The IT organization is run by the GE White Boys club. If you are not a part of this circle, you are not given the resources, budget or support to be successful in your role. Many times, these men will tell you to stay quiet in meetings and will then take your ideas and hard work and represent them as their own. They will go to dinners and happy hours together and make decisions on behalf of your team without even consulting you. You will constantly deal with aggressive, belittling and bullying behavior from these men. It is unfortunate that a Company of this caliber allows the archaic, male dominated practices of the 1970's and 1980's given the current social reckoning that is happening within our country. Do not work in the IT organization especially if you are intelligent and motivated. Go work at another Company that will value your abilities and enable you to break glass ceilings.

IT is growing and the organization is realizing how important their digital transformation is and investing heavily. There are a lot of opportunities to grow in IT and career opportunities are abundant - they look for strong talent and provide training and other options for your career growth.
Work life balance is highly dependent on the leader you work for and the boundaries you set. Many people work outside of office hours, but it's not necessarily expected of you, depending on role.
Good ideas are rewarded and a lot is invested yearly on ideas that can improve the business.
","The social structure of hiring about 50% contract employees to 50% employees is strange. Your team is often comprised of people who will leave in a few months or are trying their best to be brought in full time. It always felt like employees were treated better than contractors although they do the same work - an employee can gain an award on a project a contractor did most of the work on.
IT is quite outdated in many areas and while they are fighting to catch up, it can be frustrating at times to feel ten years behind. Some processes need improvement.

","It's literally 3 positions(customer service rep, design engineering, and field worker) in 1. Overworked. Understaffed. There's a high turnover rate, there's no incentive to stay. Rumor has it that the service planner stays for an average of 8 months. computer programs are outed. You would think since we're in 2020, a lot of things will be automated but I think they are comfortable living in the 90s. It's more of a customer service representative role than an engineering role. They say that they want employees taking days off, but most people in this department heavily regrets it because once they return they find themselves buried in work...it becomes more like...what's the point of having vacation. The days you have off, you will make up for it. Some coworkers has described it as overwhelming and stressful. Company doesn't take care of the employees who take care of their customers, which I find odd. No overtime (only during named storms). Everyone wants to do produce excellent work but it becomes difficult when you're juggling three different roles.

They spend big bucks on facilities and amenities for the corporate team, while those outside of the hub get buckets to direct rainwater and cheap jackets to keep warm. They even made a ridiculous fake money scheme to reward employees. Collect your power bucks! 

Leadership is flat out dishonest and not trusted by anyone. They get pushed by the Juno team to tell these mistruths to keep people focused, but everyone knows they are a lie and even the management team will tell you that they had to keep stuff secret for some time. 

Engagement surveys? Ever had management throw food at you and tell you that your job security depends on putting all fives on an engagement survey? I have.

Also, the company is always looking to gain ""momentum"" or ""accelerate"" by downsizing people. They also accelerate by trimming back employee perks and benefits on a slow and constant basis.

Many people complain about diversity goals leading to certain people remaining in positions who shouldn't and consistent trends amongst those who are fired. 

All of this said, if you are willing to drink the kool-aid, just say yes, and leave your conscious at home, then this company has some advancement opportunities. They operate just about everywhere in the US and some places abroad and aren't the worst paying place in town. If you like to be one little fish in a huge pond with room to swim, then go for it.

","The pay isn't competitive you can even ask around or compare online to see. The benefits have been slowly getting worse. The health care deductible is thousands and the only offer two plans now. The pension is mediocre and they just add a small percentage each year so its basically nothing. All management cares about is increasing the bottom line, reducing headcount so you are forced to do more with less employees and the compensation doesn't keep up! 3% on average yearly salary increase with small cash bonus. The company is a leader in their market sure, but talented employees can find much better benefits and pay elsewhere. That is why you see the come and go with high turnover rates. People get here and realize well this sucks and leave! It can also be kind of stagnant depending on your department its basically a hit or miss on moving up. I suggest looking elsewhere because this company is literally the one stop shop here in south Florida. If you fired or want to leave, you will have to move out of state or Miami.

Sat Jul 01 2017,Anonymous,"Palo, IA",Current Employee ,Definitely think twice,5,"-Near a ""major"" city (Cedar Rapids,IA)
-Two-year outages instead of every year
-Most people are friendly and reasonable to work with
-Supposedly has the support of a large, corporation (NextEra/FPL) with values that support the employee
","-It did not take long at all to discover that the business model for this site is very illogical, it requires a low staffing in order to remain profitable and we are shouldered with a workload equivalent that is fit for two or more people. 
-Management oversight and accountability is lacking (my guess is because the management too is also over-burdened and can't keep their eyes on everything)
-Processes that are documented and proceduralized are frequently violated, neglected, or ignorantly not followed. My observation is because most, if not all of us, don't have the time or resources to do many of our tasks adequately, safely, and/or within process. So when we demonstrate our successes/results to the senior leadership, they can blissfully conclude that we can do more with less(!!); but it is really just a baloney story because we have often obtained those successes through our detours from the proper process. And I dare to speculate that the accidents from our failures to adhere to the process has forced us to modify those procedures and processes as a corrective action(s), which makes the processes more stringent, thus we're in a feedback loop that has worsened our working conditions and our ability to follow those processes in the first place. Result: there's a greater incentive to deviate because our workload and deadlines have not eased but our conditions have become more stringent. What is wrong with this picture?
-There has been a lot of turnover in my department and in other departments in the past 2 years, lots of pain when having to compensate for the vacancies even during the times when we were fully staffed, ""fully staffed"" was still understaffed.
-Many people have retired or transferred recently and over the last few years because they got burned out, sick of their management (bad managing skills, bad person skills, created a toxic environment), or both.
-Health plan is not good. It's based on protecting you for catastrophic injury or conditions, it does very little in helping you on lower levels of care, like preventative or acute care. All plan options are expensive, which includes the deductibles and co-payments, which all are significantly high for the money you're paying and the low level of care you get.
-The matching for 401k goes by 100% up to 3% of salary, 50% for the next 1.5%, and 25% for another 1.5%. 0% beyond that. I think there are annual matching limits too, but can't recall. Past employers would be 100% matching for a lot more than that.
-I have a general sentiment that the company is cheap, which is reinforced by the plant's business model, and the company seems that they're just overall struggling. I've noticed that the stock price is about $140 these days (mid 2017) and they have a $3.96 annual dividend compared to the big competitor (Exelon at about $35/share and $1 dividend). NextEra had $16bn in gross income and $3bn in net profits, where all of it went to dividends, Exelon had $30bn and $1.1bn, respectfully, which tells me that they spent almost all of their money for the company and workers. So who is being helped here at NextEra, employees or investors? Why can't NextEra fork out more money for their people? Did I make a mistake to come here?
Advice to Management
-If the business model is really as tight as mentioned in the ""cons"", then wake up and smell the coffee, the plant cannot be ran in a practical manner. Unless the model is merely a story that the plant CAN be ran profitably with more people being able to do the work, which spells deeper problems than what’s mentioned, then get more people! We are neither robots nor horses. I didn't sign up to get burned out, compromise my work-life balance, or marry my job and I’m not sorry if my view of a job is one without so much stress and pressure that one frequently loses sleep, is unable to spend time with family, and resenting the job because it resembles more of exploitation and is enshrouded in lame buzz words like “drive”, “pace”, and employee “dedication”. We’re not dumb; we’re just hostage to the situation and we can’t get a job the way we can order a pizza.
-Whenever you hire someone, it is a bad strategy and business planning to have the new hire come on board without PROPER turn-over from the predecessor. Current practice has the new hires come in right as the predecessor is walking out the door (or has already left). There may be reasons that the process is set up this way but they do not justify the lack of correctness with sound business strategy and the RESPECT to the new hires who are on-boarding to not have this familiarization to their role. If senior management agrees with me that this is not proper, well, this is exactly what occurs at DAEC in great frequency.
-Stop being so cheap and invest more in the workers! Geeze, Exelon made over $30bn last year and they reinvested almost all of that for the company and the workers. NextEra made only about half as much money and you decided to give three times as much to your investors? I see where the love is.

","Poor leadership, HR for the site needs improvement, if you are a woman of strong character and direct, it is not received well or respected. They say they want feedback however leadership role ambiguity, expectations are not clear and conflict with fleet expectation. Politics causes slow change, if any change at all, procedures only used when it benefits someone's agenda and if you do not agree with opinions you are viewed negatively. Many people have only worked in energy and only at the site, which causes issues with best practices being shared when new people come in, or a close minded approach to anything an outsider suggests.

This lots of low to no value added work, & causes extra costs from vendors due to extra reports required / requested. 

Constant drive to cut costs, but increased demands for extra reports. This puts more work on people left at the company & reduces their work life balance. 

Lack of a vision then the execution needed to deliver it.

","This company does not need to compete for customers (monopoly) or employees (only game in town), that leaves a lot of time available for internal politics. One of the most political organizations I have worked for in that one wrong word will get you set up then fired, even if that wrong word was said in confidence to your boss. I know several people who have had this happen to them. 

Managers and fellow employees have no qualms with making coworkers lives miserable until they leave then firing them if they don't. If you work here and even think you are being ""constructively terminated"" you are - seek out legal representation. They do it all the time and brag about it after the fact. In fact, I have never worked for a group who routinely trashed more of it's ex-employees. It is a red flag every time I hear it - like someone who never gets over their ex.

If you have worked for real companies you will be astounded at what passes for management here, low level supervisors major on minors and completely miss the boat when it comes to leading teams with communication, strategy and process. Underlings struggle on what to do as management would rather build dependence than strong leaders. Positions which should be senior are turned into junior versions and the position you applied for isn't what you get. People with multiple credentials and distinguished careers have to ask permission for everything they do. The path up includes groveling, submission and endurance which is referred to as ""relationships."" 

If you just want ""a job"" as many here do, then this is fine. If you want an exciting, self actualizing career, look elsewhere. By all means, do NOT leave another city to take a role here because if it doesn't work out you will be stuck without any other opportunities nearby. Buy a second home in Florida and rent it out when not in use. You will be happier.

","Cheap aggressive management, only focused in cutting expenses. Employees are Overhead Expenses contractors are Capital Investment, anyone is doomed to fail with such accounting.

Only come to Florida if you are going to retire. They treat their employees like crap and give them multiple concurrent assignment.

Generally good people to work with (peers). Every once in awhile you might have a bar-b-que made with the cheapest stuff one can but at your local wal-mart. That's about it.
","Management is abysmal to say the least. They only hire outside for management to near exclusivity. In fact, they're more willing to hire completely unqualified personnel, those who don't even understand electrical theory, to be a manager than they are to promote one of their own technicians. They pretend to care about safety but will find ways to punish you for reporting safety issues. They don't take any real action to safety concerns and will accuse you of sheer laziness or play a type of blame game if you bring up a legitimate safety concern that they seem to difficult to solve. In fact, I've personally brought up a significant number of safety concerns with simple, cost effective solutions to solve them. It nearly cost me my job. They produce safety bulletins daily ad nauseum, that are meant to correct safety deficiencies that basically do the opposite. They allow any manger, no matter inept, to post these bulletins that make sweeping commands and changes in work practices and procedures without regard to their efficacy or actual ability to implement. Nearly every safety bulletin is either redacted or ignored by upper management as a result yet the practice still continues. They refuse to implement any real level of standardization with regards to procedure writing and seem to go out of their way to ensure real levels of standardization are never achieved. 

They have a serious personality cult which is disturbing to say the least. They require their management, at every level, to read these corporate self help books. I personally have read parts of many, if not all, of the books they're required to read. They're awfully similar to religious texts. Anyone who has any sense can see through the crap these books spill out. The peeps sloth cult is dangerous. If you don't think, act, talk exactly like they do you are in the out group. They hate outside thinkers, they don't like ideas that intrude on their preconceived notions and hey have literally no business sense. Their renewable energy program only looks successful on paper as they take advantage of PTC's in order to secure obscenely low PPA's, unaffordable PPA's, do as to choke out the competition on the back of the taxpayer. I literally pay myself back some of my own paycheck because of the heavy government subsidies. Their model of infinite growth is the only way to stay popular. They manipulate their share holders in to believing company overhead is low when in reality it's obscenely high, they simply leave out a significant portion of overhead marked as other expenditures not related to the individual wind sites. A dubious practice at best. Then, they pretend that our technicians can perform more work than they're truly capable of. They under-staff by incredible margins. By about half that of industry standards and demand the same amount of work be done in a given day, all the while continuously trying to guilt you for putting the overtime on your time card. They harass you incessantly if you dare to take a sick day, or will never, ever accept your vacation plans forcing you always to have to change them. I've even seen, on multiple occasions, managers forcing employees to cancel pre-paid for vacations because of their inadequate planning and the company will NOT compensate for losses. I've seen managers force sick employees come to work because they employee couldn't afford to see a doctor, nor should he have to, when he knows he has a cold. Yet they damned zero injuries, rather, they just sincerely discourage you from reporting injuries by issuing reprisals for doing so. In fact, they often fire technicians for getting injured by doing nothing more than their job. As most jobs in the energy industry are physically intense, he'll a person can be injured by simply walking, but that's no matter to management. No, every injury has a person at fault. Period. Every thing is someone's fault and someone's head must be had! 
I once had a manager accuse me of lying about my car catching on fire, as a reason why I couldn't work on a SATURDAY. He forced me to send him pictures. He then accused me of setting the thing on fire myself in order to get out work for the day. I really wish I was making this up, but I'm not. The same said manager also regularly accused employees of faking illnesses, of intentionally losing or breaking tools, or any number of other things to get out of work. His actions have been continuously reported to upper management to no avail. This behavior isn't isolated though. Upper management regularly accuses employees of near conspiratorial type behavior as if they're tin-foil hat wearing paranoid types. This is not in jest.
Advice to Management
Stop hiring outside for management. Period. No excuses. If you aren't promoting from within you are failing, utterly and completely, as managers. You aren't preparing your employees adequately and you are selecting the proper employees to be groomed for said positions. Because of your incessant desire for outside managers, no employee sees NextEra as a true career prospect for personal growth. All who have even the slightest ambition already know they have to leave the company to move up and because of this they make no personal investment in the company.

On the flip side, while the company is growing by leaps and bounds (expected to double by 2020), there will be hiring of leadership externally.

","Over the past several years the company has become less employee friendly. For example, they are cutting back on the amount of vacation days you can roll over, they have reduced the floor that the pension accrues at and there never has been any type of paid paternity leave to name a few.

The compensation is generally reasonable at first but they will usually just give you COLA increases so you can keep up with inflation. Even with a promotion the pay increase you can expect is modest. 

Senior management has no regard for work life balance. 80-90 hour weeks for months on end are not unheard of depending on what department you are in. 

The company feels that they are they only game in town so if you want to live in the area, where else are you going to go? Historically, this may have been true but younger generations are much more mobile than Gen X and the Baby Boomers and I think this will come back to haunt them in the for of costly turnover.

The on site cafeteria and cafe are good and very convenient. There's also lots of growth and job opportunities.
","Employee's in the accounting group are given an unreasonable workload with little to no training and expected to work very long hours. Since there's been extremely high turnover within a short amount of time, new employees are training other new employee's and managers can't manage because they're overloaded themselves. Since the accounting department is usually the last group to get the information needed to meet financial reporting deadlines, they're often dealing with last minute fire-drills. Often times, the information they're receiving last minute is incorrect and requires series of changes. People are often working late into the night to get things done. The company is growing at a fast pace due to NEP, but the accounting group is shrinking due to high turnover and overworked employees. Also, when it comes time for reviews, the raises are pretty bad, but the bonus's are decent. Year to year however, you'll never get a decent increase in your base salary and you'll probably get a bonus close to what you received the previous year (if you're lucky). The company also doesn't consider whether you're overpaid or underpaid compared to market when giving annual raises, so if you feel underpaid you pretty much have to leave the company.

Sat Jan 17 2015,N/A,"Juno Beach, FL","Engineering Supervisor in Juno Beach, FL",Agree with other poor reviews here,13,"Top Utility in the nation perhaps world. For valueless leaders and narcissists it's the place to be. It's a performance at what ever means needed little respect for law and values. Many technologies to work and learn. Nuclear, fossil, wind, solar, hydro....etc
","Highly political. Many incompetent managers and VP's. Highly level of nepotism up to the VP level. Little training. No real employee improvement or development. You either sink or swim in positions with no help. Worst leadership style of any fortune 200 company. Employee engagement and corporate value initiative spawned from dozens of lawsuits that are usually settled. But current CEO openly disregards Employee engagement as a PR front. Its basically dishonest to the employees. Company boasts best employee to mega watt ratio in nation and promotes the small over worked staff levels even though more costly mistakes happen due to overload and parallel processing too Many items, tasks or problems. Promotions and job awards are openly on a politicized and relationship basis and not the company policy of post-award based on merit and skill and experience. Agree with engineering managers post here. Specifically in Power Generation Department these problems all exist and are at a turning point. It's not the entire company but power generation is the identified leader with world leading performance that is being modeled for all other departments including nuclear. Let's hope that safety and employee safety are not affected next. We have to measure success at the cost to actually achieve it. The cost has been too high in this case and competition is good but not with total disregard. We can do this better but being number 1 at what ever the cost is irresponsible and unsustainable. God Help next era (FPL)

Clinic, gym, and cafeteria is on site. Many opportunities to take different classes and certifications in house. Benefits are good.
","You are expected to give 200% of your time. If you perform your job per your job requirements and description you will get poor reviews year after year. You are expected to exceed your job requirements at all times; yet at review time this is only ""acceptable"" not ""exceeds"". There is no chance for advancement by your qualifications and/or performance. Upper management changes your job or promotes you per others perception of you; not your job performance. This leads to incompetent persons holding middle management positions. Nextera continually stressed the importance of teamwork but I saw numerous times (incompetent middle management) blaming employees for short comings when it was the supervisor's fault all along. Decisions and deadlines are made by upper management; middle management does not explain why these deadlines cannot be made and the project moves forward only to miss said deadlines. Who is blamed? The worker bees. None of the management takes the fall for promising something that cannot be attained. This company will contue to succeed and make money but at the cost of working people to death and finding someone new to do it when they are worn out and people come to their senses and move on.
Advice to Management
There are promotions based on perception and not job performance or employees competence. Work/life balance means nothing to Nextera even though it is emphasized. Projects need to be fully vetted as to attainability of deadlines/expectations instead of middle management not having enough intestinal fortitude to state that deliverables are not achievable.

Perception is key to moving up, otherwise growth opportunities are non-existent. Senior management has alienated employees with Project Momentum.

Interesting work. 
Employees are empowered. 
Co-workers are typically awesome.
","Work life balance is terrible. Average work week in my group is 59.7 (we kept time logs) hours. 

No overtime or comp time is given and the salaries and bonus don't make up for the hours. For example, if you work 70 hours this week and want to leave an hour early next week (after working 60 hours) you are expected to take vacation to account for the ""missed"" time. 

This is all dependent on your immediate supervisor. While most groups aren't as loaded as mine there are others that are. 

The difference is that some general managers didn't give up positions and others freely caved in and cut positions from the org chart. They largely did this by attrition, not replacing employees who have left. This way they can reduce head count and also say their group is at full strength because the org chart says so. 

My group is staffed at 40% of where we were with no cut in workload.

All of this results in quite a bit of stress in keeping up with deadlines and the feeling that you are not really giving every project due diligence because you are spread too thin. 

I am unable to give the company zero stars but would if I could.

They review all company groups every year to determine if they should be let go. Turnover is CRAZY. The job I took was of a guy fired two weeks before I started.

I have witnessed blatant disrespect and unprofessionalism by management and I was appalled that FPL would allow people like this to be in these types of positions. FPL ""screams"" very loudly about corporate values and doing the right thing. But I see this is used to cover up the fact that more often than not their management team is not doing the right thing.

Excellent product (clean energy) that you can be proud of. Lots of wind and solar energy that is a counterbalance to traditional (and dirty) coal and oil based energy sources.
2. The employees are mostly friendly and hardworking.
3. The benefits package is pretty good, not the best, but slightly above industry average.
","1. By far the biggest problem is unrealistic work expectations from management. Expect to work very long hours as almost all projects have extremely tight deadlines. Your ""daily work"" (which can easily take up your entire day) is not supposed to interfere with other projects that have been assigned to you. There isn't much of a ""work-life balance"" here. In fact, it's almost non-existent (even though management claims to have made it a priority).
2. Constant emergencies and crisis management. Even issues that aren't very important can become a crisis. You can easily fall into a rut of being a constant ""fire-fighter"". There is definitely a ""the sky is falling"" mentality here.
3. Career advancement is very difficult. There are very few opportunities for advancement and even if you apply for one, you are unlikely to get it unless you have the right political connections within the organization. It's not about the work you do... it's about who you know. If you want to advance within this organization, it's not about the quantity or quality of work that you do, it's about who you've had lunch with or who's holiday party you attended.
4. Office politics supersede everything. They supersede any established processes and favoritism is a big problem. A small issue, if associated with a politically connected department, will receive all the resources while a big issue, associated with a less politically connected department, will receive very few resources. You have to watch your back and even go out of your way to make ""friends"" with certain people just to protect your own interests within the company.

","Manager's lack of support, lack of employee development follow through and general ignorance. Employee feedback obscure and sometimes just incorrect!
After reading some of the reviews on here one that stuck out was “workplace bullying”. I never thought of what I experienced at Nextera was called that as it has never happened before to me at any place I have worked. If you want to work in a “high school” like culture than Nextera is for you. Things started out fine enough until I asked questions on how to do a process or where reports came from. Fellow employees were either too busy to help or gave the most common excuse that has the least common sense. “It would be faster for me to do it myself than to show you”. So much for transitioning roles or training. Then when reports were incorrect or incomplete, they would laugh about it but not show how to correct mistakes if any. Hardly an environment where employee development is encouraged. Manager’s feedback is obscure or sometimes completely incorrect at best yet they expect results. I was warned but didn’t believe what I was hearing. I should have read these reviews before applying to Nextera.

","Transmission is definitely not the expertise to have as this company views it as strictly a cost center. Zero promotions during my time, workload absolutely impossible to keep up with, chronic understaffing, management always on a witch hunt, zero work/life balance, management takes credit for complex solutions and ignores the working level, management continuously lies about caring for employees, upward mobility, promotions, company values, trust, to only slam employees after stellar year with record results.

If you come here you honestly will never work harder in your life without any upside potential. Be prepared to be given a great sales pitch to hire on, but then management attitude is they have you trapped, because where else will you go in South Florida? Not uncommon to have conference calls weekends, 11:00 PM during the week and you better be available. Management themselves have too many projects and always want answers ASAP so that everyone scrambles for every waking hour to get the right answer. If time does not permit proper analysis for correct answer you better not be wrong or you will be looked upon as incompetent. 

No strategy for future growth, so the thing to do is to look at everything with no increase in staffing levels. Gradually lowering bonuses and raises, again, where else will you go in South Florida?

Sun Feb 03 2013, Network Engineer,,Current Employee ,A very responsible company,0,"Good job security. The company changed it's name to Nextera Energy and it is a very diverse company. It is mostly broken down to Florida Power and Light, which is the regulated Florida division and Nextera Energy Resources which is unregulated power companies outside of Florida. Because of this, it seem to keep us on an even keel. The company has been very fair with me as far as benefits and pay. I started out on a lower scale after being laid off after the telecom bubble burts and took a huge pay cut. It took me 7 years to get back to what I was making, but on the other hand, when my wife had health issues and I needed to be closer to family, the company allowed me to relocate which was a god send. I work with some of the best people in the business and they are very fair about recognizing the people that make a difference vs. the personnel that don't, at least in my department. I plan to retire with this company.
","Like all companies these days, Nextera tries to get the most out of its salaried employees and it is not unusual to work lots of overtime with no compensation other than your yearly bonus. Vacation consists of only two weeks to start with two floating holidays and 8 scheduled holiday days off. Our health insurance is on the expensive side and is Cigna which is not my first choice, but I am glad to have something.

2. The benefits are a little better than the benefits that I had at my previous employer (that was also an energy industry utility). The health insurance is more expensive compared to my previous employer.

3. The area and location is nice. It's a much healthier environment compared to where I used to live in Houston.
","1. By far the biggest con is the workload. I have never been so busy, tired, and just exhausted in my 15 years of working in the energy sector. Management has no idea of how much they are burdening their employees with projects that frankly I don't see any value in.

2. Because of #1, it is difficult to work with others since everyone is tired, grumpy, and focused on their own unreasonable workload. This makes group projects especially difficult.

3. In my 15 years I have always been willing to work extra hours when needed to meet deadlines or for emergencies. However, working extra hours has always been the exception. And when I did work the extra hours, it was appreciated. At Nextera, the extra hours are the norm and is expected not appreciated. I am completely exhausted and the 2 weeks of vacation is nowhere near enough to make up for it.

4. The so-called subject matter experts here don't really know what they are doing. Seeking their advice usually leads to unnecessary roadblocks in projects you are assigned. I have actually found more and better advice by going to internet discussion boards for my technical questions.

Because of the above, after three years of working here, I am looking for other opportunities and will probably move back to Houston when my apartment lease is up in the spring.

It's satisfying to work for a green energy company. Also, the company's stock price is doing great which benefits your company 401k plan.
","Management Churn: There is constant churn in mid and upper level management. I''ve been with the company for almost ten years and i've had eight managers and my experience is not unique. This makes it difficult to establish a solid, long-term reputation with a manager or supervisor. Many empoyees joke that if you don't like your boss just wait a year and you'll have a new one. It's difficult to work in an environment where there are changes in guidance, objectives, and goals every year.

Workload: The workload is indeed very high here and a major increase in head count is long overdue. There are long work hours and this is expected. I feel guilty leaving at 5pm and this really shouldn't be the case. It's an unsaid rule that if you are ""one of the 5:00 crowd"" you will have trouble getting ahead which is a very unfortunate situation because it doesn't take into account the quality of your work but instead just the number of hours you sit at your desk. I know employees that leave at 5:30 but do nothing in the last half-hour. They just don't want to leave at 5 and then be part of the ""5:00 crowd"". Also, better not arrive after 8:00 because that is considered late.

Management: Many of the mangers and supervisors are unfortunately poor project managers and many projects do indeed turn into crisis or emergency projects as stated in other reviews that I've read here. There is truly a sense of 24/7 emergencies working here. I joke that every day is a new emergency. A company should never write ""must have a sense of urgency"" in a job description without adding a warning ""... all the time"". This constant sense of urgency that is expected to tend to the endless emergencies is a breeding ground for stress. In addition, because many projects are poorly managed (mostly due to unrealistic timelines) this means more meetings to discuss why the project is having problems which in turn leads to less time to work on the project which already requires more time. Not a good way to run projects.

Organization: The company is definitely top-heavy. There are many layers of mangement and almost every little thing that you do, or want to make a decision on, requires ump-teen approvals from managment. This type of environment quickly teaches you to stop making proposals, or coming up for ideas, for new projects because it ends up taking way too much time and effort to get the approvals, funds, and resources needed which stifles out the excitement of proposing ideas or improvements.

Promotions: Advancement opportunities are few and far between. It's very difficult to move up in this company and if you attempt a promotion of some sort it is almost guaranteed that they will find something that you are lacking (e.g. a masters degree if you ""only"" have a B.S.) regardless of your dedication and hard work.

Salaries: There is salary stagnation. My advice to new hires is to negotiate a high starting salary because you cannot calculate or expect more than a 2 or 3% raise every year which by the way is pretty much just a cost of living adjustment. Also many new hires are starting with the same or higher salaries than employees that have been with the company for a long time which is not good for fostering long term careers here.
Advice to Management
You absolutely must address the workload issue, many of your employees are very stressed and feel like they can't do anything about it. Try to fix the issue with salaries: a new electrical engineer shouldn't have a starting salary that is higher than an engineer that has been with the company for years. Also, completely rethink project deadlines and project management within the company... many projects large and small have unrealistic time-lines and do not have enough resources (people) allocated to them.

I've seen better and worse. People are friendly and do their best to make it a nice place to work. Many of the lower level bosses are great to work for. If you are in the right group you get to work with emerging technology and new things. The benefits are in line with other fortune 500 companies. If you are in the right job at the right level you get to travel to conferences and such. Peons are not afforded these opportunities. Pay is in line with other fortune 500 companies as well.
","Work life balance is abysmal and only got worse during the economic downturn. Others have mentioned the ""every other Friday program"" - well, that got canceled. We were promised it would be revived by senior management. That was 1 1/2 years ago. Dress code is business casual; companies that seem to care more about their employees tend to adopt a less strict dress code. I've been to an Oracle interview and the VP was wearing a t-shirt and jeans along with everyone else. Too bad I don't want to live in California! I absolutely agree with the lack of long term planning and the ""everything needs to be done right now"" emergency mentality. This is what drives most of the work life balance issues. Impossible goals are set and expected to be followed - at your expense. The rush creates sloppiness which then leads to more problems tomorrow when upgrades are expected. Also, you never transfer anything to support. You create it and its your baby until you quit. So, the more productive you are, the more work you wind up with. This is not a sustainable method; I've seen product support follow a person even to other unrelated job roles when they took other roles in the company. Vacation = work from laptop. Sick = work from home. Nights = work from home. There are no good perks to working here either. Some companies provide tea/soda/snacks/coffee etc. Here you can expect water and coffee. In addition, you might be at a ""satellite"" office in the middle of no where. Fridge space for your lunch is at a premium in these offices (and first come first serve); I've been at 3 of them. No company vehicle (unless senior management). Here you can expect the gray wall no windows cube farm mentality in most of the offices. Career paths are non-existent for the most part unless you consider a career path ""applying for another job title, getting an offer, taking that job at another location, and moving there at your own expense"" a career path.
Advice to Management
First thing that needs to be addressed is work life balance (for real - not just presentations and talk but real action all the way to the lowest levels). Just because an employee is salaried doesn't mean said employee should be working 60+ hours/week month in and month out. Honestly, I wouldn't focus on pay; that is the one thing that seems halfway decent. The next thing I would address are working conditions. This is not the 60's, 70's, 80's or even 90's anymore. Our work spaces should reflect that. At many companies, weekend casual is ok for work and even for meeting vendors and performing interviews. Dress up is only required for meeting clients. This makes employees happy. Happy employees are productive employees. A word of warning...if things are still this bad when the economy begins to pick back up - be prepared for an exodus. Many retirement aged workers are already retiring and replacing them in some cases has been difficult. Imagine all of them retiring as the economy improves and then many others departing for other jobs at the same time. Its not a pretty picture. I really don't think it would take much to implement these changes. They are not impossible tasks.

Mon Jan 16 2012,N/A,"Juno Beach, FL"," in Juno Beach, FL","Stable company to work for; however, many of the employees are overworked and stressed.",9,"1) Stable company from a financial and job security perspective.
2) Layoffs are rare.
3) Salaries and benefits are average.
4) Corporate HQ in Juno Beach is a nice facility to work in (good cafeteria, gym, on-site doctor, etc.).
5) Nice to contribute and work for a company that is heavily invested in green energy (wind and solar).
6) Many training opportunities and the work is challenging.
7) Most employees are well-intentioned and pleasant to work with.
","1) Layoffs are rare but that is because the company is severely understaffed and the result is a work force that is tired, overworked, and stressed out.
2) There are constant ""emergencies"" that require immediate attention. Many projects have unreasonable deadlines. One month is far too often considered a long-term deadline.
3) Many departments could easily use a 25% increase in head-count and everyone would still have a very heavy workload.
4) Working a solid 8 hours/day is considered ""light"" and is even frowned upon (don't expect a good raise or bonus). 10 hours/day is not only average but expected. 12 hours/day is not uncommon.
5) A 3% base-pay raise is considered good. I was once told to be happy with 3% because it was ""50% higher than the average raise of 2%"". I agree that 3% is good when many are unemployed and have a salary of zero. However, after working countless overtime hours and meeting all of my goals over a number of years, I had expected significantly more than 2%-3% raises every year.
6) There is a deep ""good-old-boys"" network. If an internal position is posted, it's almost guaranteed that management has already hand-picked the person for the position long before it was even posted. Good luck when applying for internal advancement opportunities. Many employees have been in the same position at the same level for a long time.
7) Many managers are fighting to be ""king of their domain"" to become the next VP of their department. The result is over-burdening their staff with nonsense projects and difficult deadlines in an effort to appear to be a better performer (to be the next ""leader"") when compared to other managers.
8) NextEra is the only game in town in the Juno Beach/Palm Beach Gardens area. They are by far the largest employer in this small suburban area. If you decide to leave, you will need to either relocate entirely or deal with a commute to Ft. Lauderdale (50 miles) or Miami (100 miles). It is not like working in Houston (or most other areas) where if you are dissatisfied you can find another job down the street. Many of the employees feel ""stuck"" since they don't want to commute to Ft. Lauderdale/Miami and haven't found another opportunity yet that offers a relocation package.
