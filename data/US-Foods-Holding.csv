","You will be underappreciated and treated like your feedback is worthless if you are an hourly associate. Upper management and Project Managers repeatedly make bad decisions at the expense of the doers, never taking the doers feedback into account, since they see them as mindless worker fools. Though one of the company's values is to speak up and management is supposedly encouraged to respect employee feedback, that's not what actually happens on the floor. There is a terrible lack of respect from supervisors and up towards anyone that is not a ""yes man"". The brightest and best workers are overlooked for promotions if they tend to speak up to discuss alternatives to management's decisions, while their underproducing peers are promoted. Promotions outside the department rarely happen due to favoritism company-wide, unless you can move out of state.
If you are comfortable being completely stagnant in your career while making below market pay- go for this job. Otherwise, run fast and far in another direction!
Advice to Management
You don't know it all. When you ask for feedback from your employees, respect their answers. Involve the doers in decision making and you'll see how things get better. Promote based on merit and stop overlooking your rockstars.
Supervisors- this isn't a popularity game where only the people you like (those who never speak up) are valuable. You happened to be liked enough to get promoted. That does not make you better than the people on your team. Show some respect and stop smack talking your employees. Everyone sees it, and it's ugly.

Mon Dec 02 2019, Sales Representative,,Current Employee ,Too much work and not enough time to do it.,1,"The company is strong on branding and technology. I've gained software experience with Tableau and Salesforce.com which will help me in my future endeavors. I've met some very nice people that I work with.
","Too many unrealistic corporate initiatives and expectations. Cookie cutter KPI's without any regard for customer base. SFDC (Salesforce.com) is great, but upper management does not understand the amount of time it takes to record notes, tasks, requests etc. Time is needed to analyze business and to work at the pace of customers and the situations and seasonal issues that arise. From my perspective, the company is all about checking boxes so the KPI's look good. There is so much change that by the time you have figured something out it seems it's changed again. Work/ Life Balance is non-existent from my perspective. The expectation is that you get all your work done in 8-10 hours a day; which is completely unrealistic. The only way to stay at pace is to work nights and weekends and it just feels like a race on the Hamster wheel. 













 They sell ""change"", but they don't allow time for anyone to really develop in their role. There is so much turnover, that you don't know who to call in what dept. for what and as soon as you do that position changes. There are a lot of nice people that work here, but everyone is so busy and distracted by demands, that hasty mistakes are made all the time. These mistakes cause firedrills to resolve and often it feels like you are all alone, despite that the company touts ""team-selling"". Work/ Life balance is non-existent for a Sales Representative. Management will tell you to not work nights and weekends, but then if you don't meet their KPI's and other expectations, you will have to answer for it. I'm a very organized person, and I really can't keep up. It's a hamster wheel that doesn't stop. I know I am not unique in these concerns amongst my peers and everyday I question how anyone thinks this is a normal way to live.

","Losing touch with the customer by pushing technology concepts. Sales persons are required to spend a large piece of their day, usually in the evenings, catching up with all of the Salesforce requirements pushed down the chain. Life/work balance decreases continually and they are losing good talent. Good sellers need to be selling and the company needs to back them up with administrative help. Support tends to forget that if the salespersons are not selling then the company is not cashing checks. It's a growing company that should own the market rather than trying to emulate Sysco.

","SO. MUCH. RED. TAPE.

- Pay is $19-$20 an hour once u start hitting their quotas
- Burn out rate seems lower than other grinding warehouse jobs Ive worked
- Motivated to come in every day
","- New employee training is severely lacking
- Training pay is $14 and u start 75 min later than everyone else. That's 6 hrs 15 min per week, so expect to barely survive until you get out of training.
- First 3 months you will spend half those days not selecting. You will be wrapping pallets, running pallets to doors. Possibly janitor duties if the sanitation guy is on vaca. 
- You will work really hard and struggle to reach their standards. Most new people skip their breaks, sometimes lunch too, just to get their numbers up to par

Mon Apr 01 2019, Driver,"Milwaukee, WI",Former Employee ,Management is losing control of operations,2,"US Foods was a good company when I start there. I worked at the Milwaukee division for nearly four years. There was plenty of work, without being overloaded. There were good routes and management actually tried to keep things running smoothly. After they acquired Dierks Waukesha, it turned into a downward spiral.

They pay well for the work it is, but you are going to work for your money. 

They had good benefits. 

It's local and you will be home every night.

The equipment is newer and in good condition. They also have on site mechanics that maintain vehicles.
","After they acquired Dierks Waukesha, the company went into a downward spiral. Management began to lose control of the organization. This was more than just growing pains. Every day turned into a fourteen hour day. I was working 65+ hours in four days and being asked to work off days. Keys to customers locations were being lost. When I reported to my supervisor that I did not have the keys for my first two stops, he replied, ""No body cares anymore."" There is poor communication between other departments and transportation resulting in critical information not reaching the driver. An example of this is a customer changed his door and lock. They put the new key in the mail box. The sales rep knew this, but never bothered to tell transportation so the driver would know. So you waste an hour playing phone tag to find out the key was there the whole time. 

For various reasons, a lot of the management that was at US Foods prior to the acquisition decided to leave the company. The result was that a lot of the management that was at Dierks Waukesha (the company that failed) ended up in management at US Foods after the acquisition. The ironic part of this is that I worked at Dierks Waukesha and left because the place was a soup sandwhich. After the management came over, it looked more and more like Dierks Waukesha every day. 

I began to experience the transportation manager and other supervisors asking me to violate company policies. 

Routes began to decline in quality. I heard a number of drivers who had been there upwards of twenty years or more comment that they had never seen the place so bad. 

The few weeks prior to me leaving, about five other drivers also quit. 

A lot of the operational problems are the result of not properly staffing the place. There is a lot of turnover because it's a very physical, hands on job. Not many people are willing to stay there because there are too many other trucking jobs that are local, no touch, and pay well enough that it's difficult to justify staying there long. 

When one driver quit, the work load increased for everyone else. It created a domino effect where each driver quitting became the breaking point for other drivers. 

There was also zero truth in routing. I started each day by looking at my route to figure out all the mistakes I had to fix. I would be given an hour and fifteen minutes to make a drive that takes at least two hours. We were always scheduled to make deliveries outside of customer's delivery windows. Routes cannot be scheduled to exceed fourteen hours, so they manipulate the times to keep the route times down.

Cameras in the trucks and stupid policies about them like not being able to take a drink of water when the truck is moving (even in parking lots).

There is very little opportunity for career advancement if you're looking to get into management.
Advice to Management
Make the tough decisions to staff the place properly. 
Stop letting ""customer service"" be an excuse for poor treatment of drivers. Drivers who are not treated well by management are not going to give good customer service. Open your eyes to how dangerous things are getting because drivers are overworked. Hold people, including supervisors, accountable and enforce your own policies. Losing customer keys and truck keys is an absolute operational failure. Policies are in place to maintain accountability of keys, but those policies are not being followed. When this is brought up to a supervisor, it's blown off, not realizing, or not caring about the huge problems it creates for the other drivers.

Thu Oct 18 2018, Coordinator II,"Tempe, AZ",Current Employee ,Coordinator II,2,"The company is far ahead of the competition when it comes to technology. Currently in the process of updating software programs and equipment. Most departments in my facility now have the option to WFH up to 3 days a week. This is a big plus. They provided the laptops and the headsets. Many helpful tools for the field people, from the GPS delivery trackers, My Kitchen ect. 

The company wants to see people succeed. They have a mentor program, Toastmaster, training, Lynda.com tutorials, Lunch N' Learns, Spirit Committees, ERP's (Employee Ran Programs). 

The company tries to be open and honest as much as they can with email updates and quarterly Town Halls. Obviously there are some things they can't share with us until the moment they decide to, which sometimes can seem misleading, but I get it. 

Benefits are descent. Tuition reimbursement. 401K. Stock options.
","There have been instances, where a department has had issues with a Supervisor, but it takes multiple people on multiple occasions over months, before upper management and HR will do anything about this Supervisor. It seems the Supervisors are favored and the employees are looked at as the cause of the issues. Please take complaints seriously, especially when they are coming from several people in the same department about the same person. Really look into the issues, and find out what can be done to remedy it. You sometimes get these new Supervisors who have little training and things don 't go so smoothly in the beginning. They could use extra training and coaching. 

With the companies ""Process Improvements"", it now has allowed them to pick ppl up and put them in a new group w/o even talking to this person before hand. This just happened to five of us. We were pulled into a meeting, with out knowledge of what was happening. Then when they told us we were all being put onto a new team, we had to have our poker faces on to not show how shocked we were. This isn't how you should handle things. I don 't mind being on this new team, in fact I love everyone on my team, but it was like a sucker punch to the gut being told in that fashion. 

Supervisors are not protected from this either. I've seen several Supervisors told they are moving to a new group. They called it ""Cross training"". Well, that's just how they get away with doing something like that. This one Sup. has been moved five times, bouncing between 3 groups. I think he's had enough ""Cross Training"". 

When you do things like this, it doesn't make us feel secure. I honestly have not felt secure ever since the whole merger business started a few years back. 
Things have drastically changed since the days I started. Some good and some not so good. 

With the ""Cross Training"", some managers are taking advantage of this. I went to my new team and was in training the first month. My second month, I was asked to help out another department 8 hours a day for the full month. This is now affecting my learning and I felt like I was falling behind. I don't mind helping out, but A. I'm in a new position, please find someone else to help out right now. B. Allow me to work 4 hours a day in my new task and 4 in the other dept so that I am continuing to learn what I need to for my new job. 
Now i'ts been a month since I last worked on anything related to my new job and when I do get to go bk to it, I'm going to feel like I'm starting over again.

Thu Apr 26 2018, Program Manager,"Rosemont, IL",Current Employee ,Toxic culture,15,"US Foods is a great brand in the foodservice industry, and they are very forward thinking when it comes to the importance of innovation and marketing.
","Overall, there is a culture of not promoting from within. In particular, senior executive positions are filled with people who are former colleagues of the CEO. When internal people apply for roles, they sometimes don't get the courtesy of a phone screen or even a personal message from the hiring manager that they've been rejected. People are overworked and are never coached for development. No one wants to talk about succession planning or what someone's potential at the company may be. I think it's telling that in the 4 years I've been there, I can't ever remember the name of any of the highest level HR people we have had on the exec team - people are simply not prioritized here. 

There is also a toxic us vs. them culture that is the field sales organization vs. the corporate office. Very little accountability is encouraged, people tend to make allowances for the field, which empowers them to be rude rather than collaborative.

Team members who drank with the manager, even though they didn't like and were afraid of the manager, got promoted. If the manager did not like you or you complained then you would be harassed. Again, HR was useless . 3 people left from my department in a couple of months and I moved as soon as I could.

","Corporate trying to save money through Fit for growth, which meant rounds of layoffs of good, experienced professionals who knew how to keep business running with as little waste as possible. Disconnect and distrust between markets and corporate as a result. Restructuring meant those who clung on at corporate through the failed merger clawed their way up through the chaos into management positions. As a result, a lot of bad managers who don't understand how to do their team's roles, let alone manage people. A lot of management by bullying and fear. A lot of promotion through who you know and kiss up to rather than skill. Many good employees left rather than deal with a dysfunctional culture . Success depends on your manager, how well you brown nose those who have power cliqued themselves into higher roles, and how well you can ignore the bullying of those who do not agree with this culture. Upper management looks the other way because they want to save money, but a house built on a poor foundation will not stand for long.

","While HR is trying to change the culture, the culture is very fear induced. Management treats high level employees as scapegoats and they give you non busy tasks to work on. Management has way too many bosses each with their own agenda which causes a lot of confusion. And their agenda doesn’t have anything to do with the bonus, it’s about them making themselves look good to keep their job and you are their pawn. No communication in the work place and everything is kept a secret. I have heard bosses actually scream and yell at each other. This company has placed people with no management experience in management roles. This is the one time that I wished that I listened to Glassdoor. Please make sure when accepting an offer here, your gut doesn’t feel off and if it is listen to it. I feel that the past couple reviews was HR trying to increase the score.

You will be overworked and bosses expect you to stay. My boss told me that I shouldn’t leave at 5pm because it was “unacceptable”. 

When walking in the elevator every morning, people look miserable. And saying good morning and being friendly, do not expect a nice response or even one at all. 

HR will try to draw you in with the new open floor plan changes going on but walking around the floor, during work hours, there is no one there and the people who are there look unhappy and uncomfortable. The regular cube floors have very high walls and are placed into pods, which makes it to be a not friendly environment, and due to the high walls of the cubes the floors are very dark.

","Seems to me that promotion is very much dependent on your managers views and is not consistent even across adjacent teams. Feels like men get promoted way faster, with less experience. No work from home policy, which I feel is essential to attract the younger crowd from the city. The upper management may have bold ideas to grow the morale but the execution gets stuck with middle management (big disconnect between what is said and what is done day to day to align to the vision).

If you value your career, having a great working environment and culture, and having work-life balance, DO NOT WORK HERE. Don't let anyone convince you that only disgruntled employees are complaining here, this is the first time I said to myself 'Hey I should've listened to Glassdoor.' Don't make the same mistake I did!
","Absolutely zero transparency in the interview process. Lied about the job responsibilities and definitely lied about the working hours expectations. From a job responsibility perspective, the work that is done here is more clerical than substantive and the clerical work that needs to be done is done with no reasonable deadlines, it's stressful busy work that adds 0 value and 0 fulfillment. When concerns were brought up to Senior Management regarding ""I feel like I work more hours while contributing less and doing way more busy work,"" the response I got from management was ""Everyone has to start somewhere."" When I quit, they were more concerned with asking back for a signing bonus than to schedule an exit interview (never scheduled) to see why MULTIPLE brand new hires were leaving in a matter of months.
Advice to Management
Value your employees and don't lie about working hours and job responsibilities in the interview process. Also care more about scheduling exit interviews to figure out why so many people are leaving than about asking back for a signing bonus that never had stipulations in the offer.

","Warehousing and delivery personnel at most distribution centers are unionized, while sales and adminstrative are not.

Find a way to abolish the union. This is the first ""union"" position I've ever worked and the levels of sheer lazy and ineptitude among my co-workers is nauseating at best. In my short time here I've heard every excuse as why something doesn't get done. Middle management concentrates too much effort on all the wrong, insignificant nuisances which have little, if anything to do with successfully delivering to US FOODS clients (being on time, even if the trailer is not loaded or paperwork ready). Upper management could right the ship to some degree, if they so choose to do so. VPs of operations appear to be hamstrung between what is allowable per union contract and what those in Chicago demand as acceptable results, hence these individuals don't last very long here in Denver. In short, the excessive lack of communication and direction between the divisions within this division are the primary reasons it has difficulty maintaining it's current customer base or expanding its market share within the greater Denver - Metro and surrounding service territories.

The company preaches their silly little corporate culture, but there's very little of it actually in practice. The lower level managers won't hesitate to throw you under the bus if it makes them look good. Some of them are very childish and bully employees. Management seems to have this desire to want to instil the fear of god into the employees with regular layoffs. They laid off 10% in corporate last year and they plan on doing the same in 2017. There's very little loyalty to the employees here, they don't care about you as much as they preach that they do with their ""cultural snacks"". Don't get comfortable because reorganizations and upheaval are a pretty common occurrence around here.

","Raises in the two digit range but unfortunately it's the digits following the decimal point. They'll give you a giant smile as they increase your rate by less than 50 cents! 

The supervisors and mid- management have not sipped the kook-aid, they've been baptized in it. Many of them have moved up within the company and have no outside or supervisory experience. One department manager stood up at a meeting and told everyone that there had been many that applied for the jobs and that the employees should be happy they were there. This speaks volumes about their motivation and team building. 

So why they needed a big team: they have archaic, and isolated data systems. Instead of investing in improving the backbone of the business and improving it, they hired 60-80 people to continue running the old systems. They had an opportunity to make a long term investment, but instead they chose to create an ongoing liability. So along with the team building mentioned above, this is an excellent example of their stellar business acumen. 

I could go on & on about this company, but I think I've said enough to give a good idea of what they're made from. Bring your band-aides because that's how it's held together.
Advice to Management
Over the last year you've hired a lot of outside people for Tempe. So many of them are skilled and knowledgeable far beyond what you have to offer in your in internal recruits. Tap into that. Your internal promotions know the databases. However they lack any idea of how large, successful, public companies operate. It is extremely unlikely that any of the new hires work for the people that interviewed them. The supervisors have never seen the resumes, or asked about prior experience. Here's a BIG suggestion that will take you farther in team building than all the dunk tanks you could fit on the properties: 1) ask your subordinates to bring in their resume; 2) actually put in a little time to read it; 3) use the next 1:1 as a mini interview. Figure out what strengths your team really has. Ask employees what they think of some of the issues in the team/department and interaction with other departments. Then, here's a crazy thought: take what you learn from the ""outside"" perspective and build on it! You have so many slogans. Try living them out.

Every stop is set at 150 cases per hour if not more and sometimes less in some rare cases but usually they have an elevator to deal with if it is set lower. The scanners suck and need to be replaced, they are slow and malfunction frequently.
Advice to Management
This is a good company that is here and can do much better with the cases per hour changed by the stop. Start setting things at around 120 or 130 cases per hour or some of them even less so that it can give more time to the drivers to get the stop done safely. If you have to stop and pee god forbid, you will be behind! Please replace these scanners, they are outdated and need to be upgraded!
