Cisco can not keep talents. It currently laid off lots of senior and experienced professionals and hires lots of inexperienced engineers to cut down the cost. Where do those experienced professionals go? FAANG. Those young and smart engineers will only stay in Cisco for couple years, and then leave for FAANG as well. The upper management needs to think the reason why.

- There are plenty of opportunities to move within the company
- Truly care about the individual especially during difficult personal times. And I've seen time and again Senior Execs step in and help.
- Great benefits especially Medical for my and my families needs
- full week of community service beyond your PTO and everyone is encouraged to find someway to give back
- strong Senior Exec leadership especially during tough times
","- During annual 'Limited Restructures', it's not about being a rock star or not, it's your position that is eliminated including whole teams
- Tight weekly commits can cause stress within teams depending on management
- Marketing has continued to overpromise or oversell, Cisco didn't use to sell on roadmaps
- dilution of culture. when I first started you could call anyone from John Chambers down and you would get a response. Now, it's not uncommon for someone to not respond unless you cc: their manager and yours.

 Some of the initiatives and causes that the company undertakes that really makes it stand out in the corporate world. 

I think the pay is fair if you have the WFH flexibility(which has been in the culture, but depending on org and director/manager ). But now that all other tech are giving flexibility long term what is Cisco selling point.

There is a certain amount of security and stability knowing that your the big gorilla in the in the playground and the company can weather the storm
","Neoptism, too much given to people who dont contribute vs those that have been there. The established people do the work while the early and late in career get a pass. 

No RSU when you ask it is said that there are none. C'mon senior leaders you think the"" middle class"" dont talk amongst themselves and hear about who gets it. Since there answer is there aren't RSU's maybe you should give us credit that we can see the stock awards to our leaders who cut 10K people then get 35K shares really you can't take 25K shares and kick 10K down to us. Or how about stop laying people off and buying a 3 Billion dollar company the next week say maybe just once...lets start small dont acquire < 1 Billion company and maybe keep some good people around.
Advice to Management
There is all this effort to hire new grad, younger but the contributors who have been there has no opportunities. Why do new hire get more preference and upward mobility. What is the retain rate of all this hiring after 3-5 years???

The internal recruiters are terrible. Half of them have no updates and you have to chase them. They disqualify you saying you dont have the experience but it is right there on the paper(do your job) so you have to argue with them and escalate. Wouldn't you treat people who have been there a long time contribute to the success of the company through the good and bad with more respect. 

There was a huge exodus of Manager which was a perfect opportunity to give mobility to senior contributors but instead we get the friend game and just recycle managers from one org to the next. Half the time they have less experience like being a manager is sooo hard you make it seems like you are trying restart the sun

The effort has been active, on-going, and sincere with goals to improve employee and non-employee worker experience - unfortunately, as with the economic theory a lot of this doesn't trickle down to the management layer most immediately impacting employees. Cisco is an excellent and truly thoughtful corporate citizen - for the first time in my life I feel true pride about the company I am representing from a moral perspective. This is the reason I accepted the offer extended when I initially joined.
","Politics with a capital P plus some; Innovation is a prized quality at Cisco however individuals trying to work through and contribute to transformation are passively punished for not doing things ""the Cisco way""; Lack of alignment between enterprise strategy and team executions - most managers keep doing what they want to do regardless of what the stated organization and corporate strategy; Frequent and disruptive leadership shakeups in IT; non-engineering roles - despite lip service are not valued; There is very little respect for work-life balance unless you put your own boundaries up - which is problematic especially as we strive to do better with mental health for ourselves and our co-workers. There is an assumption that people have the capability and will to establish these boundaries. A lot of managers and directors here take as much as is offered without consideration to how much they should take and then perversely shame you for overworking yourself.
Advice to Management
Treat IT like an external service and organize teams into value streams where the Supplier is IT and the Customer is the business.
Corporate cultural has a tendency to throw out leaders that don't deliver in a specified time frame rather than supporting them - this leads to organizational instability. It appears outwardly like a lot of frantic reactionary decisions rather than sober and measured response to events. This is very draining for most employees.
Put your money where your mouth is and stop hiring mostly engineers and architects. Business process and architecture require people with training to execute.
Cisco honestly doesn't need one more engineer or architect. We are drowning in them. If engineers solved business problems, we would be a warp capable civilization and very well may have solved global climate change to boot.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review on your experience. We pride ourselves on our brand name and our benefits such as work life balance. Cisco hosts an annual global Leader Day and there are various leadership pathways on the Degreed Platform as a way of prioritizing leadership. However, we realize there is still work that needs to be done in ensuring our culture permeates throughout the entire business, as there are pockets that may not experience the same as other teams","Have you heard the quote "" when you stop growing you start dying' ?
Its too late for advice. Cisco is a dinosaur!

Advice to Management
Live the values you talk about. Treat your employees as valuable assets vs trying to find the cheapest talent. While the execs talk about the right things, this is not what reality is down the chain. Get people into management training earlier (HiPo programs) vs promoting your favorites and having terrible experiences for the people they manage. Enough with the layoffs - you've got to do a better job of using the talent in different ways, especially for top performers, when you have lots of job options. At some point, the older workers will sue you for ageism that is very apparent.

January 22, 2021 – A member of the #WeAreCisco nation - HR team
Thanks so much for taking the time to leave a review as well as your 8+ years at Cisco! We thank you for highlighting flexibility and work life balance as this is a benefit and engrained with our culture. We realize that while many reviews speak to employees feeling that Cisco is a great place to work, there is still work that needs to be done in ensuring our culture permeates throughout the entire business, as there are pockets that may not experience the same as other teams. Initiatives like Leader Day and multiple opportunities to provide feedback from the employee’s perspective are just a couple of ways Cisco is working towards achieving this goal","increase accountability at top management

","Market is flat or declining. Layoffs are routine. Culture is cut throat. and toxic. Too many people managers don't know how to or care to manage people but are more focused on playing politics.

","A behemoth of a company where collaboration could be optimized so much more, although it is better than it was 10 years ago. Career movements should be much easier for internal candidates than it is, of course there are job movements but should be more supported. Each team has its own employee experience based upon the leader, and of course you can expect this but it is difficult to get around this or through this if you find yourself on a team that doesn't quite gel with you. There are teams that have a fantastic, warm culture, while other teams play favorites, politics and there is no accountability. Lastly, every year we are expected to cut x% from the budget, so it became an uninspiring place to work if you value innovation, large transformation, or you care about the customer experience.

Fri Dec 04 2020, Data Scientist,"San Jose, CA",Former Employee ,"Superior Work Life Balance, Frustrating Bureaucracy",1,"Cisco has always had female leadership presence and because of that, the company takes work life balance very seriously. Also, because they invented telecommuting, that lifestyle is built into their DNA. Almost everyone I worked with was excellent. When we got our red tape out of the way, we did a lot of cool stuff.
","The company is gigantic. This primarily manifests itself in 2 ways: Layoffs and Bureaucratic Slowdown.

Cisco pretty much has a standard policy of cutting 10% of the workforce every, single, year. A lot times the layoffs make ZERO sense at all, and people often get rehired at higher salaries. It's almost a Silicon Valley tradition to be laid off off from Cisco at some point in your career.

From a software/Data Science perspective, the red tape primarily shows itself in data access. Finding the right data steward and actually completing data permissions is a frustrating and circuitous process. But, on the other hand, red tape slows things down so much it's pretty rare to get overwhelmed.

I worked out of the Meraki office and really liked all of my co-workers in the building and the culture that was built there. We initially had really good dynamic, and for a period of time I really enjoyed my day to day. Over time, we had a series of leadership changes, acquisitions, and after nearly a dozen manager changes in a few short years and an exodus of talent, my team became a shell of what it formerly was. I had great experiences finding other ways to involve myself in the Cisco community that led to a lot of amazing new connections and opportunities that I will forever be grateful for. Cisco has abundant opportunities outside of your immediate org if you are motivated and ask to be involved. There were a lot of amazing upsides to Cisco, but my immediate BU was horribly mismanaged.

We can't thank you enough for not only taking the time to leave a review, but your 10+ years working at Cisco. We agree, working remotely/from home is a great benefit and perk that we all know the value of – now more than ever before. Regarding the cons section, Cisco is taking steps to evolve how we approach workforce transitions allowing choice and time, where possible. Just as there's diversity with our portfolio, there are a diverse set of ways in which Cisco contributes externally that are in-line with our values and are core to our corporate social responsibility. We have an ongoing process of aligning our investments and resources to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners.

Wed Oct 28 2020, Financial Analyst ,"Research Triangle Park, NC",Current Employee ,Great Spot to Start Your Career,0,"-The rotational aspect of the program is great in that you can experience 4 very different roles over the course of 2 years, which is great for trying to understand a company as large as Cisco. The variety of roles is clearly a plus as you are able to preference which areas interest you as you move throughout your time in the program.
-Generally, the expectations from your teams are within reason but provide a challenge at least in my experience. Learning is encouraged and mistakes are seen as an opportunity to grow rather than a reason for criticism.
-The program itself feels like a family of sorts that you can relate with people in the same boat as yourself early in career. This makes for a great support system and provides an automatic resource for general questions.
","-Sometimes timing of role responsibilities and additional program expectations can overlap which can create a challenge; however, these are chances to exercise time management.
-Transitions can be a little tricky to manage due to turnover of roles (some new ones can be added and others) so some processes aren't as clearly defined. Generally business partners are understanding though and there's always help to get you up to speed.
Advice to Management
Continue to invest in this program as there seems to be real reception from managers to consider/utilize ideas of their LIFTers. Don't abandon the continuous improvement mindset with regards to the program as a whole, I have enjoyed my time in it thoroughly.

Mon Oct 26 2020, Customer Support Engineer III,"Research Triangle Park, NC",Current Employee ,"Great People, Great Products, Great Company, but still a large corporation...",1,"PROS:
-- Positive Work environment / Corporate Culture.

-- ","ant Exposure to New Technology.

-- Endless opportunities to develop existing skills, learn new skills on the job, and change roles.

-- Leadership is dedicated to making the company feel like one large ""team"" or ""family"" where everyone is there to help everyone else (not always practiced of course).

-- An extremely well organized and streamlined company.

-- Company culture heavily promotes internal-innovation and is very open to hearing about (and trying out) ideas of employees if they are innovative, reasonable, doable, and the employee is willing to make them a reality.

-- Technical ability and breadth of technical knowledge are prized commodities company-wide, even among non-technical roles, and often go hand-in-hand with opportunities for personal development and advancement.

-- Positive attitudes are well rewarded and those with a consistently negative outlook often find themselves a victim of the Annual ""limited restructuring"" events.

-- The annual layoffs do not usually impact technical workers (and their supporting coworkers) that are focused on growing / profitable technologies and products. 
-- In contrast to media speculation and Lamentations following layoffs on web forums, these layoffs are almost entirely avoidable. With the deluge of resources to learn new technologies and skills within Cisco, workers who find themselves layed off when their area of focus is no longer relevant (profitable) almost always passed up many opportunities to reskill, move into growing tech, etc. And the writing is always on the wall well before the axe falls. 

NOTE: there ARE exceptions to this like when huge portions of staff at one of the Cisco sites is let go for heartless business reasons -- such as when jobs are moved overseas to save money (or when jobs are moved back because customers prefer to ""speak to someone in ""). 

-- Cisco gives you a choice of several nice notebook models to use (including the current year MacBook Pro 15"") as well as quality monitors and computer peripherals for your daily use. This is a nice perk if you're a bit of a nerd, which many employees are.
Cons
CONS:
-- The (very) regular restructuring / layoff events. There really MUST be a less heartless and less disheartening way of aligning human resources with ever-changing corporate goals and fluctuations in stock prices. The current method of mass purges every year can't really be called anything other than lazy and uninspired leadership with a near-sighted view of success. For a company that so prizes innovation this practice sticks out like a sore thumb.

-- Oftentimes employees are dramatically underpaid for their work. Sadly, since many of these workers started with the company fresh out of college as interns, after 10+ years they will often find themselves making half of what an employee at another company with identical skills and experience makes. Since Cisco does not really ever give employees more than a few percent pay increase per year, many of these seasoned workers are trapped in a low paying position with no real hope of receiving a fair wage without leaving the company, accepting a (much) higher position at another company, and reapplying at Cisco a year or so later, at which point Cisco will match (or offer a slightly higher) wage than the worker is currently being paid. Situations like this really show that at the end of the day, a giant corporation that genuinely cares about its workers well-being, is still a giant corporation.

-- The Annual layoffs

-- Even when an employee is paid something close to fair market value for a specific role, the pay is typically lower than what the vast majority of other organizations will pay, and the benefits (once amazing beyond compare!) are very middle of the road. 

-- The annual layoffs

-- Unless a candidate is truly an industry leader or posseses unique skills Cisco cannot find elsewhere, there is no real room for negotiating pay / an employment contract. If the candidate attempts to negotiate after an offer has been made and rejects the initial offer, that's the end of the ball game. The hiring manager will go on down the list of the fifty other perfectly qualified candidates and offer the job to one of them. This regular practice has cost many candidates a job when they were simply following normal, acceptable job-seeker etiquette. The unstated (but commonly understood) idea behind this behaviour is that working for a great company like Cisco is a highly valuable reward in itself, and the difference in pay is accounting for that ""fact"" -- I have never heard of anyone telling this to a candidate but I have heard managers on a number of occasion allude to this.

-- The annual layoffs

-- The company was founded in Californis and has always been based in California. For those who do not know, this region of the US known is known for its very strong progressive and left-leaning social and political beliefs. And while almost always a good thing, the imprint the area in which Cisco is located oftentimes makes leadership announcements, company initiatives, etc. a little bit preachy and ""holier-than-thou"" -- looking down on those who do not always agree with Cisco's political or social stances on certain topics.

-- The annual layoffs. I am taking to YOU, CHUCK ROBBINS, please fix this for the sake of your loyal employees, you're so much better than this.
Advice to Management
