Tue Jan 19 2021, Systems Engineer,"Tucson, AZ",Current Employee ,Overall a good place to work at the moment,0,"- Competitive salary for someone with under 5 years experience.
- The company overall respects work-life balance.
- Most peers and managers are competent and have the overall aptitude to have their current position.
- Management seems to care somewhat about their employees in terms of their health and job security.
- They have been adding to their already strong culture of continuing education and personal development.
","- Promotions are steadily getting harder to come by and competition is increasing between employees. There is also a significant difference between the incomes of people who gained employment at a given level and those who naturally tried to rank up. I have heard from many employees the process almost seems entirely random. 

- One can see the company slowly starting to trim spending on employees where they can. For instance, cutting back on the terms of their retirement and pension plans for senior employees without warning. So much for it pays to be loyal. Its just an observation and does not effect me - I am a millennial with less than 5 years of experience.

- From my experience, there is a strong stigma against relatively early career employees handling any kind of increasing responsibility. Nearly all of management I have met expect one to work for several decades before you can even start talking about taking on additional responsibility.

","The bureaucracy is real for things as silly as limiting the number of monitors to being forced to use ancient software.

Lack of results is condoned and often given a promotion. There are few bold innovative decisions getting made as the company has merged and expanded. If you are motivated and driven to think big, look elsewhere. Leadership would rather make low margins in the teens than take a risk on something game changing. You will hit a wall and tire out if you are growth driven. 

Achievements and hard work are less valued than political savviness in navigating the internal company. If you are not in with the right people or with HR, your career growth is doomed but the good news is you will never get fired until you are old.

-Good opportunities to build skills and grow your career if you are willing to network.

-It's an extremely stable industry.

-As an entry level/early career employee, you work 40 hours per week; no more, no less. This can be a pro or a con depending on where you're coming from; the one caveat being that hours are fairly inflexible. If you need to do overtime it is paid.
","-If you're not a white man, it's pretty inhospitable out there. The casual sexism and racism by fellow employees is off the charts. Upper management is pushing D&I initiatives, which are great, but it really doesn't translate into a lower level cultural change. You can succeed professionally, but day-to-day interactions with coworkers will be exhausting to navigate.

-You can negotiate market rate pay coming in, but you won't see much salary growth which is a huge issue if you're early career. (Perhaps not so much if you're coasting to retirement as many are.)

-Benefits are mediocre; would expect better from a company whose main benefit is stability and work/life balance. Decent 401k match, high deductible health plan, small bonuses, no stock.

They made it very clear multiple times they do not care. Management was able to lie during a yearly reviews and evidence to the contrary, including emails from managment, was ignored. My experience and career path was never considered when I was moved positions and in 3 years I had 5 mangers and around 30 different people on a team of 6, no issues actually got addressed. Management didn't care when I repeated asked to be trained only to later blame me for not doing tasks correctly. This place isn't worth the headache.

Tue Nov 03 2020, Systems Engineer I,"El Segundo, CA",Current Employee ,Knowledgeable engineers but slow pace,0,"Steady workflow. Things get really busy as important milestones approach (Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review) but ramp down in between. Usually, your functional manager finds work for you, so there is (almost) always work to be done. There are many expert engineers and Engineering Fellows to learn from, and there are seasonal company-facilitated courses that you can take for free to broaden your knowledge. Benefits are pretty good and the Paid Time-Off program is nice, although since this is my first job out of college, I don't have anything to compare them to. Most of the people I've met so far are really nice too.
","Work can be slow and there isn't much supervision on less-experienced workers. I joined RTN 1 month after I graduated college and it was rough the first few months. Everyone seemed too busy to mentor me or train me. The company consists of a lot of experts and senior-level engineers, and they rarely hire new graduates unless they went through their internship program. I think since most of the employees are older and experienced, they forget how to treat or train new team members since usually everyone already knows what they're doing. It's difficult to learn things on your own since you'll be working with classified information. There may be documents or data that you can't access. There is a lack of mentorship, which can be discouraging, and an imbalanced workload on employees. In my department, there are some employees that have easy tasks while others have to come on weekends. Not sure if that's the nature of the job but it's something I've observed.
Advice to Management
Need to focus more on training new hires, especially new grads, and mentorship. I think a mentor should be assigned to a new hire to guide him/her during the first few months or first year of employment.

-Pay is ok.
-Work life balance is meager. They encourage you to work long hours and on weekends and they do give mod time and sometimes overtime.
-Adjustable desks.
-People joke about incompetence of upper management.
-Information is in a wiki everywhere as well as presentations are everywhere.
-Good referral bonus if you refer senior engineers
-$10,000 a year for graduate courses.
","-Promotions are political: I was passed over for a promotion even though I was the main person working on my Six Sigma project. A teammate who did almost nothing on Six Sigma and who started later than me got promoted over me.
-Overtime and time charging is nickled and dimed to the n'th degree. They constantly remind you that lunch does not count as work and want you to charge tot he nearest 6 minutes (never really enforced though, just threatened)
-People are jerks. They yell at you for not knowing things despite the fact that the knowledge transfer is lacking. Even thought there is a wealth of information no one knows where it is. Oh, and if you happen to ask the wrong person a question you will get reamed out in a group email.
-They put people where they need them, not based on the person's wants or interests. This severely stymied my career growth.
-Their COVID response was and still is lacking. There was no effort made to get the people working in closed areas working remote. And they used thermometers comparable to meat thermometers to test if you had a fever.
-Lower ranked people aren't listed too and publicly ridiculed if they make mistakes.
-They could not have picked a worse time to merge with United Technologies: they merged during March of 2020 when COVID was at it's worse. Needless to say, I am not surprised at the numerous layoffs on the aerospace side of the business.

Advice to Management
- Take the opinions of your lower ranked people seriously.

- Solid pay-scales and pay-raise opportunities.

- Great vacation and sick leave.
","As the company grows, it becomes more and more bureaucratic and over the 10 years I've worked for Raytheon, I've watched communication go down the drain entirely, even in the smallest of groups within a program.

- Overly complex management structure. Program managers, operations managers, supply chain managers, district managers, project managers, site managers, shipping managers. Literally everyone is a ""manager"" in Raytheon! It's insane. In our program of roughly 25 employees, more than 15 of them are ""managers."" 

- Not keeping up with trends in organizational structure that other companies are adopting to stay competitive. I.e. Raytheon is still HIGHLY hierarchical and I believe this comes from the high amount of retired veterans and constant work with the government. They cannot let go of the military world and they bring it into the corporate environment. Not to mention, they all hire one another into their ""Good-Ole-Boy Club"", even though they have ZERO experience in the field (We literally have a former high school teacher and genetics engineer as the head of our quality department in a maintenance program). 

In a world where decisions must be made quickly and competition is fierce with technology, Raytheon is lacking massively. A perfect example of this is it took 8 months for me to get a new laptop, even though mine was running on Windows 7 and being repeatedly locked out of Raytheon's own system due to being a security risk. EIGHT MONTHS. Emails went all the way up to our program manager, operations manager, IT department - no responses ever. No action. At least not until my computer was completely locked out of the system and I demanded IT to get me a new laptop.

- Benefits are lacking for such a large and diverse corporation. Health insurance is the worst I've ever seen in the industry. Nothing but a health savings plan (HSP)? Really Raytheon? One single medical event and years' worth of savings are drained.

- I've experienced more broken promises from management than kept promises. I've witnessed management tell an employee their job is safe and 6 months later call them up to tell them their position is being terminated. Not even a face-to-face meeting. HR emails them their severance paperwork, sign it, and done. Out the door they go after years of working for the company.

- HUGELY understaffed projects across the entire enterprise. In a world of contracts, the bottom bid gets the win. So what does that mean when you can't cut costs in overhead? You cut from staff. We pile on many positions' worth of duties onto single individuals, and this creates more and more mistakes, burnout, and eventually loss in morale. People within my program who've worked for the company for decades have told me they've never seen Raytheon so low before. All we ever talk about is money - never the people, never the quality.

- Meetings to have meetings to have meetings. My god we never stop having meetings. Doing our jobs with Bluetooth in our ears on mute, quite literally, all day long. Then after a meeting is over, individuals from the meeting call each other to complain about other people in the meeting and what a waste of time it was to have one another in the meeting. It's completely counterproductive and a total joke. Take some lessons from Elon Musk and cut the meetings. Meetings were created in a time when emails, texts, and instant communication didn't exist (you know, the 1950s). We don't need it anymore - period. I know managers that are literally paid to sit and have teleconference meetings - $100k/year salaried individuals to sit and have meetings. Talk about waste!

- Massive lack of use of technology in my particular program. We are still doing bookkeeping with physical paper and typing in data that could be easily scanned with barcodes. Yet to ""justify our jobs"" we keep doing things like we did in the 1990's. Myself and other employees have researched and presented ideas for a more productive use of technology, only to be given excuse after excuse by upper management why we can't implement these tools. Our program won't even buy iPads to do inspections of equipment with because ""security is a nightmare."" 

- Red tape. As mentioned above, bureaucracy. We have to get approval just to order office supplies - pens, paper, ink. I watched a former manager get written up because he purchased too much Windex at one time (making it a HAZMAT purchase - for a 5 gallon jug) and this was ""against company policy."" What a joke. Are you serious Raytheon?

- Lack of trust of employees. Management does not trust employees. Period. Hence the constant ""training"" and red tape that covers management's butts rather than investing in the employees.

- Lack of trust of management. Employees don't trust managers. Managers don't reply to emails or phone calls inquiring about important business opportunities and needs. But god forbid you forget to fill out your time card - management will call you at 3:30am (because they're in another time zone) to make you fill it out.
Advice to Management
You need to COMPLETELY redesign the company management structure and culture from the ground up. Raytheon continues to grow (especially after the recent merger) and we just get worse and worse. Communication falls apart, morale is down the drain, and to be honest, I hate going to work. It is nothing but a complaint and moan fest from all employees and that's because we do nothing but spend our days fixing problems that never used to exist because we are overworking our staff and more worried about pinching pennies than investing in the greatest asset of any company - the people. 

In short, get your stuff together, management. Most of you are living on double-retirements and STILL pulling salaries from Raytheon, so the drive and ingenuity to keep Raytheon competitive just isn't there. I've heard many managers say they'll be fine if the program tanks. While those of us with young kids and families are struggling to make a solid living and future for ourselves.

This company is not a family or people-oriented business. All you care about is satisfying the government instead of standing up for what is right. 

And this comes from a guy who was offered a $15,000/year pay CUT when offered a promotion after completing his Bachelor's Degree. I was told, ""You have to think of compensation in terms of opportunity sometimes. We are offering you less pay, but greater opportunity.""

Tell that to my family who you wanted to take more than $1,000/month away from.

I had to fight for 3 months to get the promotion with the same pay I was already getting.

And have yet to get a pay-raise 2 years later, although I've been given many additional duties and responsibilities.

First chance I get to be free from this company, I'm taking it.

And there isn't much you can do to keep me, since the culture is downright horrendous at this company. It's completely unenjoyable to work at the company.

I write this review in hopes of not only stirring up management to wake up and make some changes, but to steer good people away until this company gets it crap together.

","The HR department needs to be completely overhauled, they have an inability to do basic tasks and have created a toxic environment where asking for HR assistance becomes detrimental to your career. Middle management is given too much power because HR does not look at complaints objectively. HR should be the middle ground, not taking sides on HR issues. It is clear that they pick and choose which issues they want to get involved with based on severe favoritism.

Several middle managers are promoted from a technical role, which is a bad idea. Just because the person is great engineering does not mean they will make a great manager. Not to mention these middle managers try to put people in corners, whether they agree with the career direction or not. This is a sad and unfortunate way to manage employees.
Advice to Management
Create an environment that does not tolerate favoritism. Ensure that middle management is not misusing the internal disciplinary or ombudsmen process to their advantage, train HR to be objective. Reevaluate middle managers and determine which should be in a non-manager technical role and which should not be managers at all. Make this change quickly so that it sends a message through the organization that it is important. 

Take diversity seriously, it takes action not just some colorful internal emails. Diverse potential candidates or internal employees must see people like them in middle management or above to see that what you are saying is important.

Wed Aug 26 2020, Senior Systems Engineer,"Waltham, MA",Current Employee ,10 years and have never seen anything like this,2,"Former Raytheon employees have heart. They truly care about what they do and the Customer (war fighter/peace keeper - pick your position). You will learn a lot here about yourself, and how to work in teams (whether good or bad). Former UTC employees are consultants and used to working a contractor mindset (this is not a pro).
","Since the merger with UTC, I have not heard one good, positive, enthusiastic comment from anyone; be it from the now consolidated 2 businesses (had 4 last year and 6 in 2012) or the corporate entities. The merger is a takeover. The skills, innovation, thought and insight of the former Raytheon employees has been brushed aside to be led by multiple consulting firms. Book expertise is what's changing this company. Real world application is now a thing of the past. Pooling resources instead of building skills. Disconnect and inconsistent messaging and communications to employees. 10% pay reduction for parts of the company and mass layoffs elsewhere, including Pratt and Rockwell. Change is good, yes, but this feels like the real life version of the movie Annihilation. Forecast for career advancement and truly building a skillset are slim. Compensation is taking a hit from ""Covid"". Work/Life balance is decent but only if you have a manager who believes in it (policy is one thing, but everything is manager discretion). Senior mgmt is self-absorbed and is well versed at lip service. There is a clear disconnect between what sr mgmt says and what we all experience day-to-day. Culture and values are changing and not necessarily for the better.

Advice to Management
Stop promoting incompetent employees who are you buddies, family or fellow friends. I have worked at Raytheon for 10+ years. The culture at Raytheon is mostly a toxic work environment. Management favors certain class of employees over others. This enables favorable employees to make accusations against other coworkers for punishment. Management also encourages unethical and questionable behavior towards their unfavorable employees to justify their termination or self separation of the company. I have heard multiple complaints about management unethical behavior from coworkers without resolution from ethics or upper management. Raytheon does have a high attrition rate. The average new employee last about 2-3 years before they leave the company. Raytheon knows they can hire and fire base on their preferred class of employees. New employees will enjoy their time there early on but later notice a change when conflicts keeps arising every time and everywhere you go of no fault of your own. If you are a favorable class you won't notice this at all. However, the unfavorable employee will become disgruntled and be ignored by management and by coworkers. I know many companies practice this behavior but it is very rampant at Raytheon.

","There seems to be a company culture of 'do what you're told and collect your paycheck.' Not very innovative.

The engineering side (aerospace, mechanical, electrical) seems to have their stuff together, but not so much on the software side.

Interesting software, but poor to mediocre implementation.

Outdated tools (IDEs, source control, compilers, issue/story tracking, etc.)

Outdated mindset on how software is built. There is widespread use of agile in the form of scrum, but a lot of apathy or disdain for it, especially by those who have been around a long time. So ymmv on how well it is practiced. The development style of the code is very 80s and 90s. For C++, lots of use of the preprocessor, little to no documentation (whether through commenting in the code, or documents about the code), passing in-out arguments instead of returning values from functions.

This place used to be innovative when it was Hughes Aircraft Company. It is now driven by cost-cutting. There used to be a library, which is now in the process of being closed. It reflects the change in values of the organization. Many of the managers I experienced were technically incapable and failing in leadership. The place is heavy with politics and backstabbing. Engineers are often stuffed in loud cubical farms.

Sat May 30 2020, Software Engineer,"Portsmouth, RI",Former Employee ,"It depends... Probably not the best for Software, good in other areas.",2,"Depending on what you want to do with your career, Raytheon can be a good place to start or stay. Bear in mind everything I'm saying is for the office in Portsmouth, RI, and for the biggest program over there, which is in a ""maintenance stage"", your experience might be very different in other programs/location. 
For a Software Engineer, unless you're planning to move to management or leadership and you REALLY like this industry (the military, defense, politics) I do not recommend you stay here too long as your skills as a ""Software Developer"" are going to quickly deteriorate and come to a halt, it might become really hard to get a job in Software/Technology companies after getting used to how things are done here. Salaries are comparable to other defense companies, but really below to what the market offers in commercial companies (When I switched to my current employee my salary literally doubled), Health Insurance is just bad, very expensive high deductive plans . Needless to say, there are a lot of great people here and I feel grateful for how well they treated me and all the opportunity I was given. 
 Some of the highlights for the Pros: 
- There are some really nice and smart people that work here, people are willing to help you and guide you through on baby steps. 
- 9/80 schedule, you get every other Friday off (standard in Defense Contractors) 
- Modtime: you can adjust your schedule within reason to complete your hours for the week (this is double edge sword, as you are expected to record your time by the minute, more on this on the cons) 
- 10k Education Reimbursement (at least at the time I was there).
- Overall a very relaxed environment (although this depends on the project/location), but in general you just worry about putting in your hours for the week and you're done.
- 2 Weeks off in December because of the Holidays.
","Oh boy... where do I start? There's a lot of things I didn't like about this place, and a lot of it is baked in the culture already, either because people here have only worked here and they don't know any better, or ""that's just how things are"" in the defense industry.
There is a lot ""Factory Worker"" mentality here (at least with Software Engineers), you're expected to record your hours by the minute, and by that, I mean that different task/projects get different ""charge codes"" allocated to them and you're supposed to record and ""charge"" to those ""codes"" for every task you do. That leads to some really awkward moments, like meetings that you have to ""make up"" the time for because there is no charge code associated with them. A lot of people avoid company events because that would mean that you would have to end up making up the time for it (All-hands meetings, different organizations activities, etc). A lot of the mandatory training you'll have to make up in you're own time (although leadership was trying to change this by the time left). Yup, you read that right ""MANDATORY TRAINING"" on ""YOUR OWN TIME"", and we're not talking about training that is going to be useful to you in your career as an Engineer, I mean ""Ethics"" module and what not... 
This factory mentality leads to other things like holidays only providing you 8 hours to charge on 9 hour days and you having to make up 1 hour for every holiday. 
Work from home, allowed in certain programs, but very discouraged, you'll have to write a direct letter to your supervisor and manager explaining where you're going to ""spend those hours"". Snowday? Forget it, you can just do mod time or PTO. I even heard they were trying to make people use PTO or make mod time during the COVID-19 crisis. These are things that would be unacceptable in any other company, but here everybody is used to it so everybody dismisses it as ""is just the way it is"". 
My last point, probably the most important one and the reason I left, is that you won't be doing a lot of ""Engineering"" here. The biggest program here is the ""maintenance"" stage. Meaning that you'll be going through a big pile of technical debt trying to fix bugs and implement minor functionality. All of these with technology decades old, no tools and vision to fix the root of the problems(IDE? nah we use vim, Version Control? You'll be stuck with Clearcase, etc...). Don't expect to be attending seminars about the latest industry trends and/or best practices, don't even think about doing training outside the corporate modules about the technologies you're currently working with (which again, are at least 15 old). 
At the end of the day, if for some reason the program you're working loses funding (common in defense), you'll have a very weak foundation to continue your career in Software, at least outside defense.
Advice to Management
Invest more in your employees and their growth, give them a reason to stay. The Software Industry is very different in 2020 than what it was in the 90's .

If you are interested in testing your abilities and want to learn new skills, there are plenty of opportunities here. From a technology perspective, few companies can claim to be more advanced. If you want to work on the latest in cyber, AI, hypersonics etc., this is the place for you.
","The proverbial turtle moves faster than the management team. The company is so big, and stuck in 'this is how we do it here', that agility is near impossible unless senior management makes it happen (and funds it). Margins are thin and senior management optimizes for stock performance. The end result: investment in emerging tech and employee-facing programs is a joke. Your experience will really be dictated by your manager and the program you work on. Be sure to evaluate those while considering a job at RTN.

Sun Mar 29 2020, Senior Mechanical Engineer,"Huntsville, AL",Former Employee ,Worst Company I’ve Ever Worked At,7,"They were in Huntsville Alabama
","I’ve been in industry for 10+ years now and I’ve never been treated so badly at a company. The Raytheon Huntsville office exists solely as a head count. There is little to no work and what work they do have is intern level busy work. In 8 months I may have gotten a solid four weeks of work. They entice you with a very competitive salary and sign on bonus. Interview promises of what seem to be a project engineer or project lead role on so many different missile systems, only for that to be washed away the first week. The Huntsville office is second rate nobodies in Tucson’s eyes and you are treated so. You are encouraged to build and nurture connections with Tucson personnel, which is short for find your own work. The atmosphere in the office is life sucking. It honestly will get you down and make you wonder what is wrong with everyone. No one socializes in any way. If you are a new hire, no matter experience, you are treated like you know nothing and are a bottom feeder. I have never been at a ompany where a common question you hear daily is “what is your title or what level are you”. No one cares about the work just how to climb the ladder. 
After turning in my notice my lead said “okay”. That was it. No one cared. Just another guy leaving. My exit interview was the same. Good riddens. 
United Healthcare is the insurance. Do your research. Possibly the worst insurance coverages out there. The Marketplace is very competitive with the prices which says a lot. 
HR and Payroll are clueless. If you call them for anything they have no idea how to answer even the simplest questions. They submit a ticket for you to a Subject Matter Expert. I’d no idea that was a thing for HR or Payroll. It would make so much more sense to have the person hired in a role to be able to do their job. 
Since I left before 12 months I was obligated to pay a rather large sign on bonus back. To get me out of there, no problem. I coordinated 3 weeks prior to leaving with Payroll on a payment plan to pay back the bonus. Done right. Well here we are in the middle of the Covid19 pandemic and I’ve left Raytheon and started a new job two days later. As usual on the Raytheon payday I go to my checking account online to pay a few bills. To my surprise there is no paycheck in my account. After calling multiple times I was given a one line email stating an HR employee had directed Payroll to take my last paycheck. This during the time we are living in and after I’d coordinated a payment plan. It says a lot about a company that would do this. They care nothing about people.

Tue Feb 25 2020, Systems Engineer,"Tucson, AZ",Former Employee ,You can probably do better,12,"The real pro of RMS is the work/life balance: 40 hour weeks, flex-time, lots of paid holidays and decent PTO. Unfortunately, that's about it for pros. I really can only recommend taking a job with RMS if you need someone to pay for you to relocate. Take their (very generous) relocation package, work the year you'll owe them, then leave for greener pastures.
","True fact: the 2 year retention rate of new hires is between 30 and 40%. I made it about 15 months. This is not a coincidence. I was specifically driven out by a hostile manager that was poached from a vendor and brought in to ""clean house"" but I would have left sooner or later on my own due to what a mess that place was: Heroic amounts of red tape, indifferent management and a truly depressing work environment top the list for me. Getting anything done is slow and inefficient and management is pretty well useless. Amongst management and a lot of the veteran employees, there's a conceit that Raytheon is the only game in town and if you feel otherwise, there's something wrong with you. The truth is, at least for RMS in Tucson, it's a dump. It's clearly well past its glory days and let's not beat around the bush: they're war profiteers who would sell nukes to North Korea in a heartbeat if the DoD would let them.

","The STC site does not reward engineers with merit, but rather based on time. I have watched peers get promotions over me just because they were reaching too many years without a promotion. Those that perform above and beyond are consistently rewarded with ""On Target"" reviews while management continues to tell us its only a technicality, telling us we are the highest performers. Meanwhile, raises are based on performancex not even convering inflation. Upon talking to HR, they could not help me as I was simply ""On Target"". Compression raises were given last year, only for those of us that were passed on promotions anyway to be told we were not eligible as we were in higher company quartiles for our salary grade. New employees are consistently brought in making more than cleared engineers with more experience, only to sit and do nothing while awaiting clearance. Upon getting cleared, despite having had work and excelling at it while uncleared for almost a year (something rare), I was told I was not eligible for a better rating as I had only just gotten my clearance. This company rewards mediocrity and chases away good engineers that care. I could sit around like my more successfull (by Raytheon metrics)peers and do nothing but surf the internet and proceed through the ranks of Raytheon, but I have too much self respect. I can't wait to start applying for other positions, of which will recognize my worth as an engineer, and actually challenge me.

Tue Dec 31 2019,Anonymous,"Woburn, MA",Former Employee ,Eng Logistics Specialist II,5,"I got some good technical experience and got to spearhead some interesting tasks/projects on my program. It’s a big name company and generally a big company, so the benefits and vacation were strong (pay wasn’t as strong). They relocated me for an internship a while back and relocated me for my return offer as well — they are willing to give you some exciting opportunities in some new and different places. I managed to make a few friends who I still stay in contact with, enough people work at the company for you to find at least one person you click with.
","Definitely a backwards company culture. Lots of closeted bigots, or just blatant ones, line the building. Gossip and cliques are everywhere, it was worse than High School honestly. Leadership can be downright disrespectful and are often embroiled in some ethics violation or HR violation (or both). The company provides avenues to report serious issues anonymously, but solutions got caught up in politics and bureaucracy that severely slowed their implementation or prevented them entirely. 

My coworkers who were at the company a long time would tell “you think this is bad, ten years ago people walked out of conference rooms crying they got reamed and screamed at so bad.” Many leaderships, especially program managers, acted like loud, disrespectful, children — I do not exaggerate, they would scream, flail their hands, blame everybody but themselves. 

They don’t have too many checks or balances on the advancement of “highly favored” individuals. If someone senior is obsessed over an employee (whether or not for good reasons, they often weren’t) that said employee could easily advance despite the HR controls in place. In some ways, the office I worked at had a beautiful set of rules and values that were ostensibly ignored by both leadership and staff. 

The Raytheon I interned at was an awesome experience, but the Raytheon I returned to after college was a very disappointing and pathetic one. The issue may be that the different regions and offices have too much leeway and too little oversight to align to corporate requirements. So in one office you have a top tier company and another you have a company spiraling down the drain.
Advice to Management
The path to success at Raytheon shouldn’t be either to stay so long that you’re promoted out of pity or swindle your way to the top. Leadership who screams at the top of their lungs and insults their team is embarrassing, not a reflection of ‘toughness’. You have the structure to support a healthy work environment; however, it needs to be a priority to reflect the values the company has established.

Enormous amount of folks of all backgrounds and job types that have been there for years and are evidently are in position to retire very early. Probably the most integrated and equal opportunity-orientated company I have ever worked at - that is for ethnic minorities, females, gays folks, etc.
","Very low pay. Not a lot of innovation going on. Most of the work is either slight modification of existing product to create a new product OR updating an older product to eliminate obsolete parts, etc - typical military manufacturing environment. Many of the tasks that engineers perform here are handled by technicians or engineering techs in other companies I have worked at. Very clannish. If you don't fit in, go to lunch or hang with the right folks, etc. you will likely have issues. Probably the most cut-throat place I have ever worked- and I have worked at equally large, but primarily commercial, companies before. Seems like the ""lifers"" do best here. Many of the people that joined around the time I did, with many previous years in engineering, did not stick around that long either. The review process is somewhat arbitrary and based largely on supposed peer inputs. So make sure you hang with the right crowd etc. if you want to have any chance of getting ahead. Bonus plan, at least for the grade level I was at, was not sufficient to make up for the rather low pay. I would not recommend to a friend unless desperate for employment.

Sat Nov 02 2019, Senior Engineer,"Orlando, FL",Former Employee ,Do NOT work at Raytheon Orlando,5,"Learned hard lessons about corporate politics. Some very nice and genuine people, many of whom have left.
","Raytheon-Orlando is the unwanted stepchild of Raytheon corporate. Over the past 10 years, they relied on 1 sustainment contract and built up their executive ranks. They hired dozens of people in anticipation of winning follow on work only to fire them once they lost the contract bid. The management lied to employees for months before firing everyone. They had no follow-on work and did not prepare themselves for the possibility they may lose the contract. When I left, they had few engineers to actually develop the technology they needed to compete for future work. With the proposed merger, it would not surprise me if this business was closed down as the revenue drop has been significant. 

Despite their mistakes, most of executive management kept their jobs. Anyone who was close politically with management and who had been there for years kept their jobs. Some people have even received promotions. Essentially, they fired everyone not close to management and used the savings to enrich themselves.

This is not an organization a technical person should be a part of. There are no opportunities to learn and grow and it can be difficult for you to transition to another Raytheon business, many of which are more manufacturing or systems engineering-oriented as opposed to sustainment. It is not a technical powerhouse and if you find yourself on the wrong side of the corporate politics wall, no one will help you.

You can slack off and nobody cares (I see this as a con but many out there consider this a pro).
","As a young EE I wanted opportunities to learn and grow from on the job experience. Raytheon is not a great place for this. Project progression is extremely slow, so much so that other engineers joke about how little progress we make each week. Some engineers have a ""that's not my job"" mentality so responsibility for certain parts of projects will get passed around via email until everyone forgets about it.

Performance reviews are not based on performance so if you are hired on as anything less than senior, then you are the scapegoat because managers are highly encouraged to give out good, neutral, and bad reviews.

You will be shamed for having innovative ideas. Raytheon is conservative when it comes to design work, always opting to reuse old tech.

","No integrity, bad leadership, a very self-destructive culture that eats its own. At the San Diego office, there was a lot of infighting even on the senior leadership, and any disagreements were met with shunning and punishment and retaliation. What a horrible way to run a business. All while the big screen TV's in the facility preach what a GREAT company we are! Absolute hypocrisy.
Advice to Management
Get better management. Be open to criticisms and other ideas without seeking retaliation against your critics. Actually work as a team and listen to voices other than those saying what you want to hear.

Sat Sep 28 2019, Technical Support Engineer II,"Largo, FL",Former Employee ,"Don't expect to move up within the company, They hire from outside first",7,"The benefits are good, until the whole healthcare push, cheapened to the HSA plans. They do offer 9/80, competitive vacation
","The retention is a façade. They hand out shirts, have Friday Raytheon shirt days, and always profess how they are for the military. They care to get the money from a contract. They employees are of little concern, and eventually when you go through a divorce, have a girlfriend who has crohns, they don't follow proper labor policies to help employees or discipline. Found my end of the year eval decorated with lies and made up scenarios that were never discussed or written down to be able to professionally discuss what to do. Fought and won an ADR which overturned it and then had retaliation to explain I need to do the PIP in order to work with Raytheon or continue as it is a tool to help. In the end it is used as way to stress and give reasons to let go of employees. HR never listens and they ignore retaliation claims and hostile work environment claims. They force everyone to have ethics training every year, yet when explaining to them they never address it. I was let go due to a new supervisor with a new perspective in the pocket of the manager out in Caly, that had a brother who is the boss of a higher division of the same group to come in a set in motion to not listen, harrass me and continually threaten I'll be out of a job. As a veteran, I'm not impressed. Sadly I had a retired cousin tell me his career and thought that's where I should work after my time in the Navy. That was a mistake. They don't care and walk you out the day they let you go. I will be happy when I have a better job working in the field I wanted to even when I asked to transfer. Whole life engineering is a joke and waste of time. The title itself is misleading as nothing they do handles product to be part of any of the lifecycle. THe engineers who run it are of title with no knowledge of the products. Most managers are hired from other companies who have other workers do the work, build up their reports and do nothing. The supervisor who made sure he let me go, did nothing but talk to everyone around him and fly all over the country. He accomplished nothing. His goal was branding. To me branding inside your own company is a sham to hide that you are doing nothing. I actually help win a new program and lost my job due to attending a section meeting late (That did not pertain to me), and excused myself from a meeting that was for IT personnel (I am not an IT), as the manager did not know me and assumed I worked in the IT department. Raytheon was fine as long as you sit in a cubby and do whatever they tell you, no imagination, no fun, and no reason to be original. Have no life outside or work unless it is about Raytheon events to wear Raytheon shirts and make Raytheon look good. You do not matter, you are expendable, you are not allowed to be human. Do not take VA prescribed medication at work and never wear your captain American pants with your Raytheon shirt Friday trying to work. Never question authority, as they are in charge. Thanks to Raytheon, I realize I should've stayed in for 20 years and never work for them. Stuck up ignorant snobs. Your look is everything to Raytheon. You don't look good, good luck on doing well.
Advice to Management
Stop trying to look perfect. Be real , actually care about employees, not so much on the budget. Raytheon is like going to high school all over again. Classism, good ole boy mentality, and too many poor managers led by inadequately poor managers. Union is needed, as the staff would treat employees like trash. Too Lean. TEE is a joke, and the company is a mess as a whole, basically polishing a turd over and over again. PRISM was a bad idea, and all your SAPs. I couldn't move into supply chain procurement, because I did use the programs and no budget for internal employee training. I lost job opportunity every time with hiring from outside the company. Best thing to do is leave, move up and come back.
Raytheon, better let everyone know when they cut your useless employees like Office Space, upper management will roll. No need for 5 bosses to do the same job. Raytheon stock will fall and start losing money within the first 2 years after the merger, so good luck. I will be there to pick up the slack.

Within the first 3 months of my hire date, management started to treat me unfairly because I was not catching on quickly enough. Employees will throw you under the bus to save themselves. Once I got a negative reputation in the department, the environment became hostile. I spent too many days to count crying in the bathroom, car, and parking lot because my contributions were dismissed, I was highly misunderstood, and labeled a problem employee. People literally lied on me, misquoted me, sabotaged me, and the end of it all, I was left holding the bag. Management and tenured employees would not let me forget the mistakes I made. I felt non-existent and distrustful of management. They would say one thing and change the story later. I left because I could not handle the nice/nasty attitudes.

Program Analysts shadowed the Team of 5 members to learn about the product. There was a tenured analyst assigned to the new analyst for 6 months. Bring these actions back.

","Those little guys with two first names are just horrible !! The whole dog-gone department will suck you in stating that they will put you in one department and change departments when you do get there... Afterwards, they expect you to perform at something you have ""never"" even done before and try to ""embarrasses"" you if you don't live up to their ""Unethical"" expectations. The upper Management in Waltham Massachusetts doesn't have a ""CLUE"" as to what the ""REALLY"" is going on and the HR Department always sides with the Department and Site leads who do give a ""HOOT"" about you unless you ""SUCK"" up to them.. Diversity isn't accepted, it's as racist as it ever i.e. 1-2% Black people and 3% Indian and maybe 5 % Asian... They really don't want ""Diversity"", they want slaves and either you do it or else... Note: if you are a ""Whistle-Blower"" then, you are ""TERMINATED""... No-Questions asked !! The ""Good-Ole-Boy"" system is so prevalent that you can smell it all the way in Phoenix, AZ... And they wonder why soooo many people come and leave within the ""FIRST"" year of hiring. I say, fire all of the upper management and the Site leads who are ""Constantly"" losing people because, they are the one's that contribute the most to this ""RACIST"" attitudes...

Stay away from the Sensor Department and all of the other ""Unethical"" departments as well.. They will try to tear you down and put very ""Nasty"" reviews in your file... Stop expecting everyone to learn the same and punishing people for not catching on. New employees need job aids, standard tools, and 6 month learning curve before judgement is passed. Have a heart and remember that you are dealing with people and not robots.

Raytheon is a behemoth and should continue on their business trajectory because it works. Future and existing employs have to decide if the fit is right for them. It has become a giant in the defense industry through M&A, thus integrating cultures is a huge effort. They were successful during the One Raytheon campaign, but they stopped short. I would look more analytically at the leaders and evaluate them on softer management skills (e.g., diversity, staff retention, staff promotion, 360 feedback, etc.) The company knows who the legacy mid- and senior- leaders who are cancerous to the business. You should encourage them to retire or leave. You will be a better company because of it.

","The idea of working at Raytheon turned out to be much better than actually working there. I believe it to be a great company in theory with people that really do want to make it a conducive work environment, but with such a large company growing so fast they are in way over there heads. There is waste in money and effort at every corner. If the thought of working on a project where you will in inherit 10 years of technical debt and be forced to contribute to that technical debt furthermore, this might just be the place for you. If you will be put on a new project, don't fall for the notion that there will be a clean slate and therefore a new direction that you will be able to help take a product/project. There rarely is a rev. 0 at a company this size thus making it that more critical that projects have followed processes and were held to certain software requirements. The drivers of almost all of the larger or newer projects are engineers with h/w backgrounds even though all of the backend work will be software and this can lead to many problems. Overall as a software engineer with experience at multiple companies if your work and overall quality of the work you do is of importance, I would avoid this company if you have other options. For engineers passionate about their work these types of things will slowly eat away at you.
Advice to Management
Be more selective in your hires. All of your skilled staff is overworked or completely held at bay, there is rarely few in between from what I have witnessed. Hire more young, yet experienced staff members to lead software teams. Just because you have a lot of experience (30+ years) does not make you qualified to lead a software team running agile practices.

If you want to stop younger employees from leaving in droves, you should give more substantial raises to current employees instead of paying so much more to poach people from other companies. When an employee can move to another company, get an instant promotion, and make $30K more than their current salary, there’s no incentive to stay.

Most of my team members are nice and will answer your questions to the best of their ability, but will not go out of their way to help you further than that. Specific to my team only, my scrum master was very encouraging and was good with interpersonal conflicts/issues
","You are pretty much worthless to Raytheon IIS until you obtain a government clearance, which means you will be sitting in an awaiting clearance area anywhere between 6-24 months (or possibly more) doing pretty much nothing (unless you get lucky enough to be pulled onto an unclassified program that is not labeled GPS OCX.) Your salary is embarrassingly low as a software engineer at Raytheon. You will be using old technology/outdated tools that are really slow and hinder your ability to do any real software development. The team size in M2C2 is way too big, and all the more interesting/critical work are given to more senior members of the team who don't have time to really mentor you into the role. Work flow is very unsteady. You may get a lot of work for a time period, and then go 1-2 weeks just twiddling your thumbs at your desk. Upper management doesn't know anything about software or testing, but know how to stress out developers by constantly asking for work statuses. There is very little collaboration among team members and many single points of failure in the team. The work office space set-up really hinders collaboration and growth, and learning/growth is very slow. It is difficult to move up and progress in your career working in this kind of environment that does not embrace innovation or enthusiasm.

","The program I worked on in Aurora was very poorly run. Managers are always in meetings and refuse to listen to their employees about industry standards and legitimate concerns. 

Like a certain movie I had 5 managers I had to report to. Getting them all to come to an agreement on something was challenging to say the least. For example: the manager who did my performance evaluation hadn't known what I was doing the last 8 months. He didn't even know where I sat anymore. They gave me a laughable increase in pay (1%) and told me I had a negative attitude. All I did was point out legitimate concerns that caused issues later costing the company time and money. Never mind that work that I and another employee had done saved the company at hundreds of man hours that year and helped them to meet a crucial deadline.

 Communication is severely lacking and things often fall through the cracks. 

Job security is a fuzzy thought at best. They seem to constantly lay people off, panic that they're short handed, then do a job fair. 

High deductible health insurance is terrible. There is no paid training here. None. They'll ask if you want to learn something only to provide you with no way of actually learning it. 

Management needs a massive shake up.

- A month into my role I was asked to match the hours of the finance team (10am-7pm, sometimes 8-9pm). 
- Had to take a week off for family matters and pto request was not getting approved. Offered to telecommute and left the office, only to have senior finance mgr IM me and tell me to get offline on the second day of my OOO (""who said you can work remote? You need to get offline right now""). 
- Basically everything they told me during the interview was a lie. Anyone with other company experience will not enjoy working here. PM's talk to you like you're servants. Managers yell at you. People call you out in meetings in front of 5 other departments. You're told to not ask questions. When you seek help everyone is busy. No one is truly competent or sharp. 

The only ones who didn't seem to mind the rude culture were people who started their careers with internships at Raytheon and just climbed the corporate ladder. You will probably move up fast tho if you stick it out because turnover is high, but I've seen people get demoted for no reason with no HR involvement.

GBS is a cost center, there is no revenue to the business unit, so the only metric they have is to squeeze cost.
