I have been working at AIG full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Good benefits medical, dental, 401k match. Good people.
Cons
This company/department in implementation is the most Toxic relationship I’ve ever been in. The leadership is the worst I’ve seen ever. Directors hire their daughters and family and do everything they can to promote them into under serving positions at an accelerated rate. Nepotism is extremely bad here. Leadership does not develop their employees. They are condescending, rude, and very dismissive. Everyone cares about their scorecards. No clear vision. Toxic environment and no pay raises offered to employees for over 10 yrs. Implementation has terrible turnover because leadership is bad. Leadership in implementation do not even follow the companies core values. They do not and will not ever value employees.
Advice to Management
Nothing said could help this environment. Needs overhaul. Focus on your employees and giving them the environment to thrive by not micro managing, listening, not stealing their ideas and making them your own, quit hiring your family and promoting them over much more deserving internals. You want a change for the better...quit thinking your old “this is the way we always done it ways” are what’s best. Some ppl you have as managers are completely incapable of of speaking to employees on processes and procedures. What is the point of that? You just continue us to promote the wrong ppl....it’s sad. I do not recommend this place at all unless you are desperate for work.

There are no valid reasons to work at AIG.
Cons
This organization almost singlehandedly ruined the global economy in 2008 by writing un-capitalized insurance policies for predatory investment banks, which policies it knew would be paid for by the public if the situation ever went into crisis, which of course was what happened. What is enormously offensive and even-more indicative of this organization’s fraud, however, is that after so utterly destroying its own reputation through that financial crisis, it has blatantly and incompetently tried to deflect attention from its fascist policies by launching a series of “diversity” and “inclusiveness” initiatives, which only prove the reality of what it is attempting to hide.

Thu Jul 23 2020,Anonymous,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Their First Insurance Company,11,"Great snacks, great office, some cool coworkers. Stickers, Macs, great company events coordinated by the Director of First Impressions who was amazing. Snacks. Drinks. Did I mention snacks?
","Clearly ran by people who hadn’t worked the insurance market in a very long time. They may have had these long illustrious careers with legacy companies, but they didn’t know how the sausage was made. And eventually it became obvious that they cared more about maintaining their “yes people” than they did about correcting course for the business. 

We had people who literally had no job responsibilities. Literally could not tell you what they did. Still can’t. 

More to come. Always more to come. 

Anyway, when AIG announced that BBI was being placed into runoff, there was no honesty. No reaching out to business partners with concerns, no telling all of the employees at the same time, lots of hard questions to answer with no support from the (lack of) strategy team. They scrambled to find investors, but did little to support the front line workers who sold their reputations to make the company run. In the end, all they did was burn their market facing employees and burn a whole lot of brokers. 

The concept addressed needs of the industry, but it was in the hands of the wrong people. They were so inward facing that they couldn’t accept criticism, refused to understand the needs of our customers, and ignored all recommendations given by the market facing team to improve numbers. In one meeting with external partners the CEO said during an introductory speech “who knew building a middle market insurance company would be so hard?!”

Well... everyone did. EVERYONE. And we didn’t need a McKinsey study to tell us this. 

And to top all of this off? Someone’s first day was the day the runoff was announced. Two people in operations began a couple weeks before that, and a few others in Q1. All while they knew the company was about to go under. 

All the company culture in the world can’t make up for the sheer lack of humanity from the independently fiscally secure leadership team- AIG knew in early Q1 this was happening. Why didn’t the CEO know? And why did she let people still be brought onboard?

More to come.

","My Manager misrepresented the job as a more senior level position, but it turned out to be basically a departmental coordinator role. He then began harassing me about my disability 5 weeks after I started the job. My complaints against him and my requests for disability accommodations seemed to be handled professionally at first. But soon the work environment became increasingly hostile even after my Manager quit. I was asked to do work on projects where resources were withheld from me, and when I asked for help, I was told that I had failed to complete the work as assigned. Team members who did not hire me told me I should share more about my personal life to strengthen my business relationships. I tried that, but not only did it work, it made things worse. The information I provided was used against me, and I was ultimately fired for having a panic attack at the office. I was escorted out of the building by security personnel and was told I needed to go home to get some rest. The next day, the same HR Rep I had worked with on my disability accommodations paperwork called to tell me I was being terminated for disruptive behavior. It was extremely traumatic. When I filed for unemployment, they fought it and lied about the reason I had been fired.
Advice to Management
I left a good job at a company where I had tenure to come and work at AIG with the promise of growth opportunities, a relaxed culture with work/life balance, and a collaborative team. But it was a team of senior level employees who had worked there for 10+ years, and it did not feel welcoming at all because I was different. Just because a person has a disability does not mean that they cannot work effectively when given the right resources and a fair chance to succeed. It might not be easy to provide accommodations, but it is also not easy to live with and work through a disability. Show some compassion to people who are disabled. Work with them and be transparent with job duties and responsibilities from the get go.

- Good teams (that I worked with anyway)
- Flexible management

I may have been very fortunate, but my direct supervisor(s) and team were great. Very reasonable and understanding with regard to work/life balance situations, easy to work with, and genuinely enjoyable to interact with. Upper management was supportive of continuing education opportunities as well. Depending on job grade, you can start for example with 24 PTO days, in addition to the 9 company holidays. Matching 401k up to 6%, no vesting period, and an additional 3% company contribution in place of the frozen pension from a few years ago.

I also worked from home for the entirety o my tenure there, which was fantastic. The amount of time you save on getting ready in the morning and driving to/from work, and the work/life balance it allows is just about immeasurable.
","- Rigid compensation structure
- Difficult to move up
- Below market pay

In order to move up, you basically need someone above you to leave the company. This is understandable as AIG hadn't been doing very well in recent years. For reference, I think the combined ratio went from 1.24 to 1.01 or something in one of the recent financial reporting periods. Expense and loss ratios were also unhealthy for a while in the GI segment due to garbage underwriting, so it makes sense that they weren't eager to throw hundreds of thousands of dollars around in pay while unprofitable (unless of course you were hired to the ELT, which they hired plenty of over the last couple years).

Definitely rubbed me the wrong way to see six-figure exec after six-figure exec hired, but they were pinching pennies with regard to their grunt workers, particularly those who has saved them tens of thousands of dollars year after year.

Tue Apr 14 2020, IT Manager,,Former Employee ,Toxic Environment,7,"The low level and mid level workers try their best under horrible working conditions. Many truly care about making a difference and it was an extreme pleasure working with them while trying to make a positive difference. The amount of hours that salaried people are putting in, not to save their jobs but to get their work done, is ridiculous. But they do what they feel they need to do anyway.
","Senior management is a disaster. Favoritism and brining in their cronies really deflates the motivation of the workers and middle managers that have been there and attempting to do their jobs. In IT it is more important to please senior management and suck up than to support the business community and make their jobs easier. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Any positive financial numbers are played with to make it look like progress is being made.

This is not really a ""pro"" but it's something that AIG ""leadership"" has adopted as their ""go-to"" talking point when firing all of their employees. False company. False values. False leadership. For all the younger folks out there who are looking for a future - do not bother coming to this company. Especially if you're a woman and/or a minority. All they do is continue to hire old, white dudes...perpetuating their PALE, MALE, and STALE position in the market. HR is complicit in promoting their false positions...so don't believe anything they say.
","Lots of turnover - so rather than hire more people, ""leadership"" keeps delegating more responsibilities to lower level workers with no increase in pay and or promotions...then blaming them when things fall apart (as they do on a daily basis).
Advice to Management
Quit being so fake. Quit talking about how much you care about diversity...then only promote old white guys to positions of power. If you're reading this - check out their postings on this very website. They're primarily about being a diverse employer...but it's not true when it comes to leadership roles in the company. I'd challenge HR to simply provide a pivot of ethnicity by job grade (24+) and share it with the globe...

Quit talking about how much you care about your employees...then fire them, and leave the burden of the work on those who have remained and are in psychological distress from your mismanagement. If you really care about your people...then either do the right thing (i.e., ""what you would like done to you"" is a good starting point I learned in kindergarten)...or just quit because you're ruining people's lives.

They roll layoffs throughout the company on a regular and continuous basis just below the cut-off number which would require public reporting by law.

The best answer to restructuring is simply NOT to remove all experienced workers.
Retain/retrain some of your existing staff. Make the environment more stable. Staff will do so much if they feel they are valued and not just waiting to be axed.
Compensate upper management with their very high salaries only after they have succeeded.

Advice to Management
I worked at AIG for more than three years. The pros are the insurance is good, paid time off is plentiful, and there are many fun activities to participate in. 

That’s where the pros stop. The cons— well take into consideration you work for managers that have meetings constantly and these meetings basically consist of talking negative about staff and whatever manager isn’t present. I personally overheard this countless times. Then there are the managers that will do anything to please their favorite workers. We are talking about giving extra non-workforce approved breaks, free stuff from snacks to other material items. You have managers that handle escalations and managers that refuse to handle escalations. Here comes the best part of it all— AIG in Jeffersonville has a major history with layoffs and finding any reason they can to get rid off staff they (managers) aren’t friends with. I’ve seen managers get laid off who were very hard working and would do anything to help you- and then other managers get to stay who spend their days coloring boards for their team. Those are the managers who also refused to take escalation calls when no supervisors were available. 

The pay is terrible for the industry you work in. There are zero raises...ever. The holiday schedule is terrible. There are no “real” holidays paid off. They put your name in some sort of made up rotation and if you get picked you work. It doesn’t matter what the situation. Some of the managers here micromanage you until you can’t breathe and then there are managers who don’t care what you do. Your manager can change without notice. There is no consistency between managers. When we rated our managers I caught my manager filling out the form for himself! 

The HR system is a complete joke and if you had an issue you had to call into some sort of line and wait on hold to talk to someone for who knows how long. Paychecks were messed up by payroll all the time and getting that fixed was also a joke. 

Out of the two other call centers I worked in this was by far the worst. I left because I found another job in fast food that paid me better and at least I could fix the customers problems. At this job, you depend on other and outside people to fix issues. Rarely is it a one call fix. Service providers were rude when we had to call them and some of the calls people were down right abusive to me. 

I would stay FAR away from this place. It is terrible. When reading through the other reviews it makes me think they are fake. The Jeffersonville location is not a good place to work.

Mon Jun 10 2019, Financial Advisor,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",Current Employee ,DO NOT...I REPEAT...DO NOT WORK HERE,12,"You have a lot of autonomy. There is no micromanaging and no one is looking over your shoulder as your work. You also get to work from home. You choose your own hours. You also get a 3% 401k match. Health and dental benefits are very good. You get a book of business (but we will talk more about this later).
","Wow, where do I start? This is a pure commission role except you get a ""training bonus"" of $24k during your first year. After the first year, it disappears. Also, be careful because they will promise you about $15k-25k of residual annual income from your book of business during the interview, but I have not met one person who has received anything close to those figures so make sure to get the promise in writing. They basically tell you this so you will take the job. Also, the training is inadequate. You do not get any sufficient training on procedures or paperwork. You are basically thrown to the wolves with little upfront training. Therefore, when a client calls you for help with service orientated tasks, you will most likely not know how to help them, have to call them back, and they will most likely be upset. You will have to devote a lot of time to teach yourself how to do simple these simple things that they should have taught you how to do adequately (i.e. properly use the CRM software, do paperwork, look up detailed client information, resolve client services issues like address changes, etc) and this will consist of calling the help line and being on hold for while and hopefully getting someone that can actually help you or hoping that a more seasoned advisor will take the time out of their day to teach you how to do things and help you. All in all, you are learning as you go at the expense of the client. AIG is also all about sales. If you have morals and you always put the client first, you will have trouble thriving here. A lot of client are not treated very well. If you don't believe me, google ""VALIC complaints"" or ""AIG Retirement Services complaints"" and prepare to be baffled. You will be reading for hours so grab a glass of pinot noir or an IPA and get comfortable. There are countless complaints online. Bad customer service is the culture of the company. Financial Advisors are given more of an incentive to sell than take care of their clients and put their needs first. A lot of the clients that you will get in your book of business are clients that are unhappy and not eager to do business with AIG because they have had 5 financial advisor in the last 5 years and have been receiving awful customer service and inadequate attention. Also, AIG is not the only or primary financial services company that has their money for most of the clients due to the lack of good service. Also, the managers tend to be grossly under-qualified. Most of them are top sales people that were then promoted to a management role even though great sales people almost never translate into great managers. The managers only care about their ""scorecard"" because it is one of the factors that dictate how the get paid. The ""scorecard"" consists of different metrics of a district or region. By the way, none of the metrics on the scorecard exclusively measure customer service. All of them measure a sales or headcount. Yes, you heard me-headcount. ""Why is headcount a metric?"" you ask. It's a metric because the turnover rate is so high that managers have to constantly replace people who are quitting. In order to make sure that managers are hiring people as fast as they are leaving, AIG made it a metric to ensure that managers are always replenishing AIG's supply of FAs. If a manager does not hire fast enough, it negatively affects their pay. If they are doing a good job of hiring as quick as people are leaving, they get a good payday. Also, if you choose to become an enrollment focused advisor, be careful. Most enrollment focused advisors struggle because it is very hard to make a good living while having work life balance as one. Unless you are in a group with little to no competition, you are blessed enough to get a mentor who is working in the group with you, take over a great book of business, or you have years of experience as a financial advisor in the group space getting enrollments, prepare to work very hard for pay that is not commensurate with your efforts for about 2 years before you start making real money. In other words, you will be broke or you will be just scratching a living but will work 10-14 hours per day. Also, it is a culture of nepotism. Many senior advisors get their family members hired, and those family members often are given the best clients, books of businesses, groups, mentorship, and/or support. On top of the nepotism, management blatantly picks favorites. They will give the best clients to the advisors they like the best and give the rest of the clients to the advisors that have not kissed their butt enough. They will tell you it is a pure meritocracy, but it is not. Yes there are some instances when a advisors who prove themselves get better groups, clients, and a better book of business, but being a manager's favorite or someone's family member will get you preferential treatment and further. There is also a lack of female advisors and advisors that arepeople of color, so if you are a woman, black, latino, etc., think twice before accepting the job. Diversity and inclusion isn't really AIG's thing and is not a focus of the company when if comes to recruiting FAs. Lastly, prepare to spend, or as they call it ""invest into your practice"". The company made its advisor pay for the company cell phone up until recently! You have to buy company branded marketing materials . You will have to buy all of the items necessary to create your own booth/table for events/site visits/workshops/seminars unless you are lucky enough to borrow them (i.e. AIG branded table cloth that is about $80). Also, prepare to put an enormous amount of miles on your vehicle and spend a fortune on tolls and gas in order to cover your groups, see clients, go to events and go to your sites and not be reimbursed for any of those miles! The products can be better. A lot of them are proprietary, have high fees, and under preform. In a climate where investors are savvier and fee sensitive, it is hard to compete with other companies that have a better reputation, better customer service, more products and lower fees. Again, some products are under performing and many are not beating the market. So yes, VALIC is charging high fees for under performing products. Also, they say that they are a full service one stop shop wealth management firm, but they are primarily an insurance provider that mainly sell annuities and insurance that just so happens to offer brokerage products in efforts to keep up with their competitors. At the interview, they will not tell you any of these things because the company is not very transparent and is always selling their advisors a bill of goods. It is not a culture of integrity!

","The internal audit department as a whole was completely dysfunctional when I was there. The head at the time said in team meetings more than once that all of the people who left the department for better opportunities were losers. I have news for her, almost all of the people who left have now gone on to much more successful jobs, no credit to her.

She also made up reasons to give poor ratings, even when our own managers disagreed. They had a forced ratings distribution, and if you are new to the job or newly promoted, would give you a poor rating. That is really demotivating. When I brought proof of my performance, she didn't want to hear it. She was determined to give me a particular rating, and created a narrative to support it. My life was a living h3ll under her and when I tried to move internally and worked night and day to help them transition and document my work for an entire month, decided they wanted to keep me yet another month. I had to threaten to quit to be allowed to move on. And this is a person who made it very clear that she thought I was useless. Why try to keep me then? 

there was also a lack of trust on her part, and people weren't allowed to work from home or get certification if they didn't have a high rating. But it is impossible to break out of this box, if she has decided that you deserve a poor rating.

She would also overturn my audit results, saying that it was more important to keep the client relationship. I agree, partnership with the business is very important, but that doesn't mean that we should just give a good rating if there's a weakness, does it?

I will never forget the way she treated one of my hardest working coworkers, either. Turnover was really high, and I don't think that hard work will be appreciated there. Get your experience and move on.

As someone who knows the industry, I know how different this experiment of ours actually is. The people are committed and ambitious, and the potential for success because of those people is second to none. And like any startup of this size, there will be times where the ambition seems too tall to overcome and too ambitious to tackle. But unlike other startups of this size, we have the backing, commitment, and drive to get it done, in piecemeal and with patience. That, to me, is the difference.
","Every company has a con, and I think the one here is that there might be a bit too much emphasis on a lateral and flat organizational chart where some layers might benefit in execution and accountability.

","There is a lot of talk about work life balance here, and there has been for years, but they are just buzzwords here. Employees are consistently asked to more with less people and in less time. Unrealistic expectations around delivery dates come from top leadership and flow down to middle management, and then out to each employee. Eventually, there is no one left to delegate the work to, so those employees miss dinner with the fam, their son’s baseball games, or every doctor appointment they know they need to schedule, but who has the time for that? Not the guy on his laptop that is working during the baseball game instead of enjoying it.
Advice to Management
Stop the unrealistic expectations with you. Tell your boss no once in a while. Tell the guy your entire team of 15 has no bandwidth for those 4 new projects. Do that, and you’ve saved your employees 5 more projects you don’t have to delegate and they don’t have to miss dinner for.

AIG prioritizes building relationships with major clients, which is something many other carriers don’t do well. Still a household name in the industry.
","AIG is a shadow of its former self. Previous CEO tried to flatten the organization, only to have Duperreault come in and hire dozens of outside executives which made AIG top-heavy again. Raises and promotions are generally non-existent while the new CEO collected a staggering paycheck for 2017 akin to a top professional athlete. Archaic IT infrastructure in most divisions, teams are lean to the point of high burnout and turnover. Little to no support staff in some underwriting units, leaving underwriters responsible for the entire end-to-end process. Very low morale, and bureaucratic speed bumps at every turn. Still has somewhat of an Old Boys’ Club mentality, which could be a pro or con depending on the person. Senior leadership is completely out of touch with the people who actually generate revenue.

-Work life balance is pretty great depending on who your management is.

-Some of upper management are easy to talk to whenever you have a concern or facing a problem.

-The company offers great volunteer opportunities.
","-Working from home can be a hassle with the computers the company provides. 

-Lack of respect from coworkers. Have had stuff stolen from desk when I was not in the office.

-The personal respect from coworkers is nonexistent. I have had coworker disrespect and take advantage of me. I never worked at a place where you have sneaky people manipulating their way to get what they want. The code of conduct is nonexistent. 

-Some workers have a ""bully"" mentality.

-Way too much gossip on the work floor. I guess that's the reason why people come to work, is to invest in the work floor drama and gossip.

-Be aware of associates who, will make up lies and manipulate just to get to the top of the career chain. 

-Everything is urgent so prepare for that especially working on special projects. Sometimes you will be belittle or thrown under the bus to upper management if things are not met in their time frame. Associates actually have the time to monitor our every move. 

-Moving up the career latter will take some time depending on what area of the company you work for.
Advice to Management
-If your associates have a concern about anything that relates to the position or the work environment please take action sooner than later. 

-Continue to emphasize the Code on Conduct rules and regulations to associates. If they can't abide by the rules and regulations or, you see a consistent pattern, please take executive action. 

-Be more attentive to our associates and their needs. 

-Upper management should not invest in workflow gossip or drama with associates they manage. I have had my manager every now and then express his/hers concerns and frustrations with other associates/counterparts on the same team they management.

If you trust and reward your employees they will want to work hard for you. I have not received a raise in 7 years and I am always rated an above average employee.

I have seen several staff get let go that have a great deal of knowledge and are a great benefit to the company. Those are the people you need to focus on keeping because when you get rid of them and their knowledge it makes it more difficult on the rest of us.

When you are a claim representative and you are on the front lines doing all the hard work, talking to customer and adjusting the claims and your manager is the one that gets a 6 figure bonus it really makes you wonder why you are working so hard.

","Way too many levels of managers. They have 7-8 layers of managers in various departments. In some instances there are more managers than people who do the actual work of writing policies or managing claims. 

They are trying to save costs by not replacing workers at the bottom levels and this creates situations where the people who do the necessary work of insurance are overworked.

The technology is horrid. They push out systems that are inefficient and not catered to the specific departments using them. The systems often crash and the Help Desk is useless. There are no more on-site IT techs so it takes days or weeks to resolve even simple computer issues. 

The attempt to hub everything from Human Resources to IT is short-sighted and creates a block of work flow. The people in the hubs frequently have no answers and there is frustrating delays to get anything done. Also, HR often does illegal things because they are clueless about state-specific obligations and requirements.

Training is not sufficient, barely covers the job, role responsibilities, systems utilized. Most of the NY auditors are leaving the company in March. Shadowing and learning from these auditors would of been highly beneficial. This was never organized. Not sure what is going to happen when these NY auditors leave the company as new team members are barely trained. 

Guides are outdated, there is not a specific learning and development dedicated team. 

Realistically they should of completed their mass hiring 6 months before phasing our their NY team members. We should of been shadowing, partnering, utilizing these individuals - instead we received sub par training, inflexible work schedules and low morale. This is all covered up by shiny new offices.

Wants Lamborghini employees but only wants to pay Toyota Prius Salaries, tacky and laughable. They are trying to hire employees off the clearance rack or at a Goodwill Discount. 

Please read my email below to a Talent Advisor that went unanswered. That’s cool. I had to put them on notice. BEWARE! Do not state your salary requirements until you had a formal interview and they are really considering you for the position if you want to be successful getting hired here. I REPEAT DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY FIGURES.
Advice to Management
Good Morning, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to make sure you received this before you were out of the office, beginning tomorrow.

I’m a little confused because the last thing we discussed was compensation expectations and after giving my response I haven’t heard back from you. (Very Interesting).

So, let me ask you this, is AIG in the practice of shopping for the cheapest employees?

Are they looking for employees who are extremely qualified, have an extensive background, and experience but trying to bring them on at a discounted rate? 

Are they trying to hire employees on clearance? 

Are they looking for employees that are of a Maserati Ghibli caliber but only want to pay Nissan Versa salaries? 

My next question, if this is true (which I now do truly believe so) as a Sr. Talent Acquisition/ Advisor, etc. How do you sleep at night? (Knowing that you are not paying employees what they are worth-some call this smart business, I call it stealing)

I just need some answers and explanations because I find this extremely shallow and disheartening. Also, I want to forewarn my friends, colleagues, and social media connections who may be looking at AIG for potential employment.

These potential candidates (myself included) have sacrificed time and money to receive a college education and most of us have an extensive work history and background that makes us very qualified to the positions we apply for, and our compensation should reflect this. 

If AIG, doesn’t have the “budget” to pay a certain salary for a position then it should be noted at the bottom of the job description what the STARTING SALARY IS, so that way candidates are not wasting their time submitting an application hoping they say the “right compensation figures” to continue to be considered for a position. Not listing the starting salary on the job posting but if a candidate applies and seems like a good fit then asking the candidate what his/her salary expectations are before a formal interview is had, is tacky, deceptive and laughable.

This isn’t the first time time I’ve heard about AIG using these tactics and I didn’t want to believe it because I’ve heard so many other great things and was extremely excited about the opportunity to work for such a well known and respected company. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed. 

You may say, it has been extremely busy, it’s the holidays, it’s the end of the year, You’re trying to complete everything before you’re out of the office starting tomorrow, it’s short staffed, most of your colleagues and the decision makers are already on holiday, that I’m not the only applicant, that there are hundreds of other applicants as well, but the truth is, I NEVER heard back from YOU after giving my COMPENSATION EXPECTATIONS so that tells me you / AIG don’t want to pay employees what they are worth.

So, you have a good holiday, Christmas, New Years, I hope you share this email in a department meeting because this is an issue that needs to be addressed and maybe the goal in 2019 for AIG should be to pay and hire employees for what they are worth.
Helpful (10","Good Morning, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to make sure you received this before you were out of the office, beginning tomorrow.

I’m a little confused because the last thing we discussed was compensation expectations and after giving my response I haven’t heard back from you. (Very Interesting).

So, let me ask you this, is AIG in the practice of shopping for the cheapest employees?

Are they looking for employees who are extremely qualified, have an extensive background, and experience but trying to bring them on at a discounted rate? 

Are they trying to hire employees on clearance? 

Are they looking for employees that are of a Maserati Ghibli caliber but only want to pay Nissan Versa salaries? 

My next question, if this is true (which I now do truly believe so) as a Sr. Talent Acquisition/ Advisor, etc. How do you sleep at night? (Knowing that you are not paying employees what they are worth-some call this smart business, I call it stealing)

I just need some answers and explanations because I find this extremely shallow and disheartening. Also, I want to forewarn my friends, colleagues, and social media connections who may be looking at AIG for potential employment.

These potential candidates (myself included) have sacrificed time and money to receive a college education and most of us have an extensive work history and background that makes us very qualified to the positions we apply for, and our compensation should reflect this. 

If AIG, doesn’t have the “budget” to pay a certain salary for a position then it should be noted at the bottom of the job description what the STARTING SALARY IS, so that way candidates are not wasting their time submitting an application hoping they say the “right compensation figures” to continue to be considered for a position. Not listing the starting salary on the job posting but if a candidate applies and seems like a good fit then asking the candidate what his/her salary expectations are before a formal interview is had, is tacky, deceptive and laughable.

This isn’t the first time time I’ve heard about AIG using these tactics and I didn’t want to believe it because I’ve heard so many other great things and was extremely excited about the opportunity to work for such a well known and respected company. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed.

It is a great place to grow, but I would not recommend most employees try to plan to retire from here.

-PTO: I think that new employees start off with 25 days of PTO yearly plus 10 days of paid vacation.
-401k: Company matches up to 3% of pay. AIG also puts in another 3%.
-Tuition reimbursement 
-Insurance
-The new CEO (Brian Duperreault) seems to be doing some great things at AIG. I think that as a whole, the company is moving in the right direction growing the business.
","-AIG has some smaller businesses that they purchase and they don't really receive the same treatment as working in a corporate office would. There is no flex time at my location for most employees, and there is no option to work from home.

-Pay is not great. In our location most jobs pay $10-$20k less per year than jobs within 5 mile radius. Even glass door estimate states I should be making $15k more per year than I am paid at AIG.

-If you are a good worker, you will inherit a ton of other jobs and responsibilities without gaining any pay increase.

I worked at AIG full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
I worked with some 'great people' many years in Fort Worth Data Center. Great opportunity to learn new technologies, and how to deal with managing a never ending landscape of revolving executive stakeholders. 

Great benefits, PMO, 401K matching, etc.
Cons
Shifting IT model to outsourcing in many areas. As-A-Service = lose your job - that's the trend into 2020.

Work all day, then do APAC calls all night. Work life balance is there, but you really work around the clock. 'Follow the Sun' should be an IT support model, staffed properly. It's not to be taken literally and that is what's going on. We literally followed the sun from one geography.

It is time to pay attention to your employees. The way to make a company great again is not to spend a fortune to bring in a new Senior Management team and then act surprised when our expenses are too high.

I have been at AIG for over 10 years and I have made it through some tough times but frankly this is the worst. I have never seen the morale in the company this bad. It is time to figure out where you want to be in the next few years and develop and execute a plan to get there..what we are seeing now represents total chaos.

-Consistently restructuring / laying off - probably in the middle of a mass layoff as your reading this. 

-Work life balance is bad because they are constantly laying off and your trying to perform to keep your job

-Promise a bonus when you start but majority won’t even come close to target

- No strategic direction - it’s like kites in a hurricane

- Technology centers not culturally diverse - it’s hard to make connections at work with such a wide cultural divide. 

- No loyalty from leadership to employees.

- Leadership manages up and is completely out of touch with employees, mainly because they know they are moving to another position in the near future.
Advice to Management
The culture here was toxic and just as toxic when I left. No happiness, No sense of accomplishment. I have a friend who helped define cloud migration and has saved millions over a few years. Raise? Bonus? — Nothing - he’s worried about being laid off. With this kind of culture and a literal feeling of dread among your best employees how can you expect to move forward? You don’t even realize it but this culture is doing the exact opposite, which is stifling innovation. With smaller companies able to establish cloud based resources at large scale for very cheap - larger companies with mounds of technical debt are suffering - those who don’t innovate can’t make money so they have to save money - usually in human capital -ie: layoffs. Meanwhile the innovation cultures are prospering by simply creating an environment that encourages great work. I’m so happy I found it.

2) Recently, (last year or two) it has become a bit more lenient on employees private lives by allowing us to focus on family first, etc. (Work-from-home due to injury/incident or leave early to pick-up kids). Work-from-home situations are common but can be negated by any manager who deems they need the team in the office.
","My job of supporting projects of other company's divisions. I have run into quite a few (these people rarely get fired):
1) Clients who believe rules do not apply to them and badger our superiors to get the attention and priority for their projects.
2) Clients that think everything can be handled within a short time frame.
3) Clients that fail at time management or planning with immovable deadlines. 

Regarding the higher up management, they do silly things without understanding the full impact. (ie ""Hiring positions for a future goal but firing positions that support the new position"" and ""the firing of teams with no adequate backup plan""). There is a ton of office politics, and mid-upper management is comparable to Game of Thrones.

And importantly for monetary compensation:
1) The company will not give annual increases onto your pay. Which means whatever you agreed to when you joined the company is whatever you get paid every year unless you get new promotion/position (which upper management has limited those lower management and under to a few so it becomes a contest/lottery - but mid-upper management positions do not follow these constraints). 
2) There is no OT unless approved by mid management or higher. Lower management either ignores extra hours or rewards undocumented half day(s) to balance the hours. I have worked a minimum of 37+ hour weeks (non-inclusive of the lunch hour - and sometimes I have to work while eating lunch) for a majority of a decade.
3) The company does not reward hard work, but only work that they deem is highly noticeable to mid-upper management. And they only reward disloyalty quite often (ie. if a superior who relies alot on a subordinate who decides to leave the company- the superior can easily reward the subordinate to stay). The disloyalty I can somewhat accept, but the not rewarding loyalty is quite a disappointment.
Advice to Management
Stop hiring people for positions(in management) that you believe is necessary for the future of the company if those positions that mainly rely on support to do their jobs. Ending up firing a majority of support because you deem those new management positions invaluable to balance the budget will just leave a inverted pyramid hierarchy. Especially when you don't full understand the job do and/or if you don't have a backup plan for their responsibilities.

IT management is worst I've ever witnessed.
Extremely fragile infrastructure, supported with archaic means and largely focused on fingerpointing and addressing the symptom, not the cure.
In fairness, the first couple years weren't too bad, then there was a sudden change in philosophy -- Work / Life balance went out the window in favor of long hours, weekends and night work, working from home became a dirty word. You never actually are not at work...expectation is to monitor email 24/7. I was told that I was overpaid by my manager, which was an insult to my profession and years of experience I don't expect to be compensated in Central Wisconsin as I would be in Minneapolis, Chicago or even Madison, but when factoring in the expected hours vs. the salary, an insulting figure was the result.

","1) No action taken against you is based on work merit.

2) Management is extremely poor and unbiased in many of their managerial decisions. Several of the managers have been with the company a very long time and refuse to change, so they should probably be replaced. But no one looks at management's performance only their salaries when it is time to reduce staff. 

3) If you EVER have any sort of problem with ANYTHING it is best you keep it to yourself, management will target you for ANY issue or concern you bring to them, no matter what the issue is. And other employees and consultants CANNOT BE TRUSTED keep your complaints to yourself.

4) Lake of cohesiveness amongst teams/coworkers or anyone else that works within the same business unit.- This is not enforced from an executive level team so it is not enforced anywhere else within the company.

5) Cannot trust or accurately train new team members/co-workers for fear of being replaced by that person because management is so sneaky and underhanded. Nor can you share work for the same reason.-- this is known or felt throughout the entire company by MANY employees.

6) Incentives, bonuses, is not based on your work merit or job performance but more on your likeability with management. You could be dumb as a rock and your work output erroneous and low level with very little effort and concern for a job well done and management will worship the ground you walk on with incentives, raises, bonuses, comfort in knowing your role is secure. it's is almost as if management is jealous or hateful of you if you take pride in your work and give 110%--but at the end of the day no one cares how good or great your work is only how much your are liked.

7) Work Morale is extremely low on a very regular basis as a result of all of the above.

8) The ability to advance from within is a joke. Talent Acquisition almost never selects or considers a candidate from within 

9) The company overall has poor values and does not appreciate their employees.

10) The technology and process used are so dated that it is difficult for you to find a new job with the lackluster skills and experience you acquire or retain as a result of working for this company. Had I known this before becoming employed I would not have accepted the offer. Just imagine being in a rut of a company that progressed very slowly compared to the rest of the industries and years later trying to find a new job only to find out your knowledge and skills acquired from your last employer are outdated because there is no growth provided from the company. no training. old resources, outdated software and equipment

Stop hiring and rewarding at the top! Look at the people who are hanging in every day, getting the work done and reward them. Stop with the lies, don’t insult our intelligence and just be honest about things! Everything wrong with this company comes from the very top and rolls down.

","Workload is heavy and expectations are high. While telecommuting is a benefit, seems to limit career growth if you're not aligned with an office and visible there.

Be more willing to listen to all points of view. The employees closest to customers have valuable input that should not be disregarded.
