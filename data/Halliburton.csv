Main campus is extremely nice
You meet and work with some good people.
","-Poor culture. They say they are ready to change but when someone comes from outside the industry to actually change things, they face extreme resistance.
-Management, especially in the ASG IT department, is horrible.
-No incentive to go above and beyond. Your bonus is not really tied to your individual performance and is instead tied to company/department. So if you are reading this researching working for them, make sure you negotiate hard on salary instead of bonus. you can also negotiate on vacation.
-They DO NOT LISTEN. This might just be a specific department, but they ask for feedback, you give it and nothing is done. Example - I was vocal multiple times to my senior management about how I was being treated and nothing was done. In my exit interview, I once again provided this feedback and said I can give detailed examples with dates/times and other individuals in other departments that will confirm my information. Instead of wanting that information, HR just said "" I will give that feedback to my manager"". What does that do if you dont have those details? How will things change? Its hard enough to go out on a limb and be vocal, even more so when it is a down market for oil and the entire economy. 
- You are a number. The mentality is how much work can I squeeze out of this person. Example- due to market conditions they let go a huge percentage of the main campus in March/April 2020. Well that work had to go to somebody , and that somebody are the people who remained. You didn't get your bonus, they didn't offer any type of increase for these new responsibilities. You worked longer hours and there was not a shred of appreciation. In fact, it was relayed multiple times, ""just be grateful we have a job""
- You are not valued. Expanding upon the above point. In addition to no bonus, no increase for new responsibilities, you were also furloughed. Senior Management says, ""we are in this together"" while a good portion were exempt from the furlough. While the furlough was shorter than expected, that was to bring people back to let them go.
- They do not invest in training. One would think as a leader, if I know my people are taking all of these hits one after the other ,and are scared for their job ,then I can offer them something. Invest in their skills, offer them a day off, DO SOMETHING!!!
- They will say we have to go lean, but then spend a ton of money elsewhere. For instance, just recently they announced a million dollar grant for scholarships to try and recruit new talent. How about invest in the talent you currently have. You have the money!
Advice to Management
Its easy, Treat people better. Especially the high quality people you kept after you let everyone else go. Make sure you create an environment where people feel valued and have an open line of communication where being candid and truthful is not only welcomed but expected. If you can't give monetary compensation, then do something else to show employees you appreciate them. Empower your manager and senior managers to show value to the employees, lead by example. When someone cares enough to do an exit interview, make sure you get details from them and actually follow up on the concerns. Otherwise the cycle will continue.
-Overall this was the worst experience I have ever had in my professional career. While I realize this was a down market, you see the true character of companies when it is bad. If you truly want to recruit and retain the best people, it will be a good idea to treat them way way better.

Thu Oct 29 2020, Production Enhancement Engineer,"San Antonio, TX",Former Employee ,Horrible place to work,0,"The money while I worked as a cement engineer was okay although if you calculate your salary vs the hours you actually work, its below minimum wage which Halliburton has gotten into trouble for multiple times. I worked in Cement for 4 years before moving to Production Enhancement for 1 year.
","The first year was terrible as they would ""haze"" the new engineers to toughen them up. They would send me to the worst jobs at all hours of the night and then expect me to be in the office the next morning at 8 am. I was salary without bonuses for that first year. I calculated my hourly rate with all of the extra hours I worked to be around $4/hr. I never complained because I was young and fresh out of college and thought that was how the world worked. Come to find out after I left the company, that even though I was salary, I still should have been paid overtime. What they were doing was illegal.
As a woman, they never gave me opportunities to move up and improve. They said the only way to get a promotion was to move into a new department and start over with my training which would take at least a year. So that's what I did. I moved and right when I was about to finish my year of training, the market dropped and they let me go so they wouldn't have to pay my new increased salary.
Another con is that I was harassed during my last year while I was in training in the new department (production enhancement). I reported it to HR, they swept it under the rug and I was let go without severance less than 2 months later. After working at this company with zero problems for 5 years, no write ups, exemplary reviews by my superiors, and always on call, they let me go without warning and no safety net at the end of the month. Of course I fought for my unemployment which they tried to deny, but since they had no case, the judge awarded me full benefits. I wish I had sued.
Also the work/life balance is terrible
Old Boy's club
Only 1 woman executive when I was working and it was for HR and she was best friends with the CEO's wife. All other leadership positions were male with 1 exception. As an international company comprising of 80,000 employees, it was pretty telling.
Advice to Management

Out of four managers that I had, two were good and two were horrible. The good managers will care about your growth and work life balance. They will also make sure that you have everything that you need to succeed. Good managers tend to be more intelligent as well, and can understand situations and communicate well. When good managers push you to work hard, it is for a good reason and you feel properly incentivized.
","I had two terrible managers including my final manager. One bad manager got fired for an “HR issues.” My final manager was quite frankly not competent. He did not understand basic concepts of what his employees were doing. He kept claiming he was a “picture guy” but in reality he was just not intelligent enough to understand what was needed to get the job done. He was a very proud Halliburton employee with multiple family members employed, so I think he had connections even though he was a terrible manager. On a communication level, he acted mentally disabled at times. He completely killed the morale of my entire team to the point that some of us were happy we got laid off. I was definitely overjoyed when I got laid off. Management seems to be the primary problem. I see Halliburton as terrible company to work for and I would not go back for even twice my old salary.
Advice to Management
Do not be a bootlicker. Do not be a “yes man” that passes off all your work to your employees with no responsibility for yourself. Understand what your employees are doing and what they are going through. Communicate better and put a priority on team morale. Realize that loyalty is earned. Employees are not any more loyal that companies are loyal to employees, which is not loyal at all. So good managers will find ways to grow and enable their employees.

- 401k match and stock program 
- Good pay if your client gives well bonuses
- Excellent technical training classes.
","- Really poor management. They overlook their most hardworking employees and only give consideration to their buddies. 
- Toxic environment in the office. If you do not know something they will shame you in front of other people. 
- Promotions are given based on presentation and classes completion, not on work performance. Classes are limited and you might be sent to 1 round of courses per year. 
- Really long hours and zero flexibility to have other people cover you. 
- Some company men on location are extremely rude and condescending. Halliburton does not care about your mental wellbeing they just want the job done.

Medical was a catch but getting expensive now
","Stay away from the Interwood Houston district. 
Management is going to be against you if you call them out on any safety issues.
Instead of concentrating on the job, they make you drive to another rig to pick tools/equipment to use for the job, instead of using a hotshot truck.
Don't work here, they never seem to keep employees due to poor Coordinators/Management
They reject overtime but still wants you to work overtime
You get a lot of sleepless than and expect to carry out the job.
Coordinators lack communications
You don't get parts for the jobs on time
They cut bonus and paychecks every 6months
They hire a bunch of trainees and expect you to train them without incentives 
The moment you go against the coordinators, they will find some time to fire you. 
You work 24/7 but they only pay you 12 hrs for being gone and whatever months the jobs take. You are allowed to charge 13hrs per day being away on the job, anytime over 13hrs they reject it or question you why the overtime. 
Please, IMO stay away. This place is where you call the 'Toxic work environment'.
Advice to Management
No work-life balance, even when at home, you are on call
No career growth here.

Coordinators lack communications

","Upper management is out of touch with the day-to-day operations of their workforce and it shows in the decisions that are made with no regard to quality of life. Instead, they only talk to lower managers who are typical ""yes"" men. The people who move up are not promoted based on leadership ability but, rather, on the misconception that ""they were good at doing their job, so they must be good at leading people"". This repeatedly proves to be a wrong assumption.

Once promoted, lower/middle managers immediately forget where they came from and begin selectively enforcing rules and/or making new rules (with no regard to quality of life) in an attempt to justify their position. Their safety program is reactionary and knee-jerk with no thought to how the new policy will actually increase safety. 

Journey management is a perfect example; before and after every shift, you must submit a plan of you intended driving route along with an ""analysis"" of any hazards you predict encountering. If you select the wrong hazard, you will be forced to wait until management wakes up and reviews your submission to approve your drive. One of the hazards listed is ""Have you gotten 4 hours of sleep in the last 16 hours?"" However, you work a 12-hr shift on location with a 1/2 hr safety meeting before your shift. Don't forget wake-up, breakfast, and drive time. By the end of your shift, you will have been awake for a minimum of 13 hrs (of your 16 hr window) It is mathematically impossible to get the required 4 hrs of sleep in the previous 16! If you check the box that says you have not had the required amount of sleep, they will deny your permission to drive and require you to sleep in your vehicle for a few hrs before submitting another request. This leads to people being forced to either lie on the form or be punished by being made to sleep in the vehicle. 

Another example was when hurricane Harvey struck the gulf coast. 12 of 14 crews were shut down and the people were sent home to ""take care of their families"". The compassion was thinly veiled since they waited until some of the locations had to be evacuated by boat and the locations that were further from the gulf continued to operate despite the people on those crews living in areas that were subjected to hurricane damage. It wasn't about sending people to take care of their families because people whose houses were flooding were being threatened with termination if they went home. 

Pay is one of the lowest in the oil field with university educated engineers hiring on at $11/hr. In the San Antonio office, there has not been a promotion from TP to STP in over a year.

These are just two examples of countless instances where poor management made it clear that they do not care about those under them.

However, while utilizing the tablets for work orders on equipment, implement a signature/initials block for the items inspected IE BPMS and CPMS . There seems to be discrepancies on who is held accountable if the task isn’t performed correctly. Otherwise, kudos to lower management for actively commending us one on one for going that extra mile. I appreciate it ! If it weren’t for that issue, I’d given my employer 5 stars.

Advice to Management
Consider creating a position of ""Personnel Coordinator"" that has nothing to do with the jobs, but everything to do with your employees. Although I have not worked here long, I have experienced the disconnect between field engineers and coordinators. The latter seem to only be concerned with the technical side of the job - how fast it's going, what tools we're pushing, etc. There is never a question of how is the team doing. Consider creating a schedule of some sort for MWD Engineers and sticking to it. I think an extra coordinator dealing with personnel could do this and much more of the things that get pushed to the back burner by current coordinators.

Advice for potential MWDs looking for work with any employer, not just Halliburton: 

You work 90-100 hours a week and are often gone weeks at a time. You are on all 24 hours a day. I don't mind that, but you need to be compensated for it. Look around at several companies and do not accept low ball offers or reduced pay. Before you hire on, thoroughly understand pay and total pay (per diem, salary, vehicle allowance, tool bonus, hourly pay, overtime hourly pay etc). Ask questions - ask what the pay structure is and how raises work. Find out what has to be done to earn a raise. 
A competent MWD should be making at least $10-11k a month after 6 months (based on 30 day work month) and experienced hands command $13-16k a month (based on 30 day work month, vehicle, salary, hourly, per diem etc). Know what the market pays! look around!

I have no comments on or advice for senior management as I never worked with those areas.

Advice to Management
Before upper management makes a decision to layoff (terminate) an employee, check his/her performance review's. Make sure local management is not protecting an under performing employee. Example: Such as a demoted manager who could not perform his/her job tasks or a manager who was terminated from one region for racially charged comments and rehired by a friend in a different district (As a Sale Representative).

","Management (especially upper management) is out of touch with the field staff. We are the ones on the front lines sacrificing our time with our families to make the company money. They work you non-stop with little pay and no relief. We were already short staff in the field and numerous people quit. Instead of trying to hire more people to at least replace the ones that left, they make us work more for less pay while saving them money. They leave you out on a job for weeks at a time without know when you will be able to go home to see your family. When you do get home, it's for a couple of days and then they expect you to go back to work again for weeks without any relief. All this while management is sitting back at home spending time with their families and sleeping in their own beds collecting their bonuses that the field employees earn for them. They do not care or listen to us when we all tell them that we are unhappy and will leave. We are just a number to them.
Advice to Management
Hear and appreciate what your employees are trying to tell you (especially the revenue earning ones out on the front lines). We have children too that needs to see their parents.

Mon Aug 27 2018,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,BED BUGS !! Chemicals and lack of safety,0,"Lot's of hours (80-120 a WEEK!) if you want them, if you don't want THAT much you are considered a ""1%er"" ""Looser"" and will NOT be called for any jobs.
","Low hourly pay, working conditions, unhygienic people. BED BUGS ! The mattresses in the trucks are not covered, rarely if ever changed, covered in filth, chew spit, sweat, bed bugs and who knows what else. All that aside, my last day on the job was when they had me pouring 5 gallon containers of acid into the mixing tanks WITHOUT PPE!!! It was a high profile job and because of the particular client and there was no time to locate and don the proper protective equipment. Over the radios (which the client was also on) I was instructed to hurry and start pouring the acid in. NO face shield, NO chemical suit, NO chemical gloves... Yes it splashed while pouring into the bins, yes it was in the air and I was breathing it, and yes it got on my FR's and SKIN as well. 
I was thoroughly impressed during the safety school classes because they were extremely focused on the proper safety precautions and equipment, HOWEVER when you are in the field it is a totally different story. Some of those young kids running the equipment will surely loose their health and possibly their lives because they don't use the safety equipment and its pretty much expected of them to do that because there are 10 guys waiting to do the job if you wont take short cuts. You can't communicate on the radio when you are wearing a respirator so nobody does, just dust masks. Health is not worth any amount of money and its not like they were paying much anyway, the kicker was the amount of hours. You have to work 80-120 hours a week just to make a decent paycheck. 
Its inconsistent as well. You could work 33 hours strait and then not get another call to work for over a week. Killing all your long hours of overtime. 
 A high percentage of the people that work there that were in the field are dismembered, quite a few have died and many have health problems because of the exposure. Absolutely not worth compromising your health for this or any company.

Advice to Management
This review pertains specifically to JRC in Alvarado, TX. I could care less about the management, my advice is for current employees and potential employees: DON'T DO IT. 

The morale is very low. Everybody knows this is a horrible company and don't mind tell you how much they hate it. Lots of old timers are sticking around waiting to retire and often reminisce on the days when oil was $100 a barrel and there was room to advance your career and overtime and raises were abundant. 

However, these days raises are 3 years in between and you are likely to die making your horrible wage before they decide to give you an opportunity to advance. I don't know what exactly the management is doing but we lost at least 8 employees, 2 Project Group Leaders, and a former president who had been working at Halliburton for 40 years in the span of 2 months. I guess people are starting to catch on as to how horrible this place is. 

People gossip and talk behind your back. Management will tell you that they are going to pay more than they actually are while continuing to force you to do the job that you aren't getting paid for. There are people who have been there for 15 years and only make $15 an hour. Sometimes they offer a lot of overtime, but you literally have to work mostly 12 hour days, 7 days a week to have a decent paycheck. Even college grads should stay far away from this place.

I am so glad I left this truly horrible and awful company.
Helpfu","This review pertains specifically to JRC in Alvarado, TX. I could care less about the management, my advice is for current employees and potential employees: DON'T DO IT. 

The morale is very low. Everybody knows this is a horrible company and don't mind tell you how much they hate it. Lots of old timers are sticking around waiting to retire and often reminisce on the days when oil was $100 a barrel and there was room to advance your career and overtime and raises were abundant. 

However, these days raises are 3 years in between and you are likely to die making your horrible wage before they decide to give you an opportunity to advance. I don't know what exactly the management is doing but we lost at least 8 employees, 2 Project Group Leaders, and a former president who had been working at Halliburton for 40 years in the span of 2 months. I guess people are starting to catch on as to how horrible this place is. 

People gossip and talk behind your back. Management will tell you that they are going to pay more than they actually are while continuing to force you to do the job that you aren't getting paid for. There are people who have been there for 15 years and only make $15 an hour. Sometimes they offer a lot of overtime, but you literally have to work mostly 12 hour days, 7 days a week to have a decent paycheck. Even college grads should stay far away from this place.

I am so glad I left this truly horrible and awful company.

Great and affordable health insurance, discounted stock purchase, 401k matching, dental and vision. Discounts available for Halliburton employees for everything from vehicle purchase to lasik surgery. This is a good place to get started if you do not have any oilfield experience. But if you do, it will just infuriate you.
","Basic per hour pay is the lowest I have ever had in the oilfield as a CDL Hazmat driver. You are dependent upon overtime to make a decent wage, working 100+ hours a week. When limited to 40 hours a week when work is slow, it is hard to want to come to work. Because of massive layoffs last year, the supervisors that are left are a mixed bag to work with. In general, they do not care about you as an individual employee, only how your physical labor can help them get promoted or get their next bonus. Promotion is easy to obtain with the competency system, but it takes work on your part. No one is going to teach you what you want to know, you have to go after it. You might get a whole $1 an hour raise, putting you still under the oilfield average. The orientation training I went through was sub-par and did little to prepare the new hires for what was really expected of a frac/acid operator.

Now is the time to start watching for hard workers that you want to take over crews and make things happen. Support your new employees with proper training to promote their safety and your own. This will only help you win contracts in the future.

","This is a lifestyle not a job. You will give your entire life to the company. 
You're just a number, not a valued employee. 
Training is non-existent. They expect you to learn as you go without direction. 
Management is straight awful. They want their bonus checks more than they want you. 
They will throw everything they can on top of your work load and expect you to do it, unconditionally, without complaint. 
If you do complain they will ""run you out the door.""
You're completely stuck where you're at. They will tell you the want you to move up but hold you where you are because they can't train someone else to pick up your jobs. 
Job description doesn't pertain. They will have you work out of a wrong job title so they don't have to pay you as much. 
HR is in the pocket of management so everything you have questions about or want to complain about goes straight back to your manager and you end up with retaliation. 
Management and HR will not listen to you, they make their decision about the situation and you're expected to shut your mouth. 
Management threatens you for anything that they don't agree with.

Poor understanding of IP and how to value it, firstly trying to patent everything (which leads to the entirely predictable “volte face” because of escalating cost) and real pressure to invent all the time (very short term) which exhausts and destroys the creativity of the scientists. 

Demoralizing atmosphere prevalent throughout company - most likely from the current economic climate, but does not need to be so with good positive leadership.

Trying to become a “GE” like company in terms of process strength but it is being inconsistently applied by various PSL’s and I can’t see them being as good as GE anytime soon. The application of “LifeCycle”is a farce.

They are trying to become a technology company for the right reasons, but there is too much of the old company still prevalent for them to modernize at this time in my view.
