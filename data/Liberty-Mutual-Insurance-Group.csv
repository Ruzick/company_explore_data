I have been working at Liberty Mutual Insurance full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
You get paid on time... I struggle to find many pros for working at Liberty Mutual
Cons
The entire company goes through annual lay-offs', and if you don't get laid-off (and you get to ""keep"" your job) the company will restructure your role/job and have to do the same job, yet reduce your pay by 10%
Advice to Management
Especially within the Claims Organization - define a clear 2 yr road map, and stay the course. Having yearly lay-off's is no way to build trust.

Low pay, extremely unrealistic expectations, a lot of micromanagement. Excessive meetings that Attorneys do not have time for. Everything is to set you up for failure.

Basically, when you add it all up for the amount of work you are doing, it comes out to you practically making minimum wage.

","Everything! You will literally get fired for any little thing at this job. Most were working so many hours of OT without claiming a single hour just to keep up with the workload in fear of being fired for not keeping up or for using OT. If you weren't fired bc of production then you were fired for surveys. If you receive a bad survey then you were on your way out even if the survey was not about you. Don't waste your time or sanity! I saw many ppl go from happy to depressed in less than a year.

No room for promotion. Most just jump to other claims departments when they are about to get fired.

No work/life balance!! NO WORK/LIFE BALANCE! You do not have the opportunity to work down much of your claims before a vacation so you have extremely angry customers when you return. Co-workers will try to help while you are out but they are swamped with their own work.

","I was told I didn't know how to do my job because I asked for the address of an FTP server. I was told to hold off on a project via email then told in a performance review I was receiving a bad review because I never tried to do the project on my own with no other input other than ""use tool x to do stuff"".
Agile isn't actually used just a bastardized form of it that they can use to hold developers to whatever sprint deadline they want (they change mid sprint, often, as does your workload.) I also once witnessed one of my co workers be unable to describe what the absolute value function did (removes negative sign) when discussing an SQL query. 

 The majority of the ""innovation"" is window dressing done by managerial staff that's been there for 10+ years and sees change as a way to loose their 6 figure salary, which is all they probably have cared about for the past decade anyway. If you suck up to them and make them feel good about their bad decisions and poor management they will promote you quickly. If you do anything else you get given grunt work and inevitably fired for ""poor performance"" which they will refuse to describe.

If you do want to stay there, never talk to people outside your team or your manager will not only know they will reprimand you. You must ask all things of your manager and hope that they somehow go and talk to the people you could just email directly. Why? Because. Shut up and take it or leave.

This isn't a development environment its a 19th century work house where the managers are the staff and their underlings are children, who should be seen but not heard.

Hard work does not pay off here, in fact it doesn't even matter. Manager was checked out any time we had a one on one meeting, often late and then distracted. Management is swapped out pretty regularly so you have to 'start over' every year almost.
- Terrible Work/Life Balance (Pre-Covid): They expect you in the office every day and if you choose to work from home they don't accommodate you in meetings and leave you out of important communication when its very easy to jump on Slack or a meeting. - Inequality in the workplace: was held back during my pregnancy and taken off projects because my manager didn't want to put too much on my plate, however I was very capable and extremely put off by this. I didn't feel comfortable going to senior management with this since I've had bad experiences in the past with concerns that went unanswered or ignored.
Advice to Management
Really take a look at what's happening here: the hard working talent has either left the company or is out the door because they aren't recognized for their efforts. End of year reviews come as a surprise when all throughout the year things are looking good, and then you're hit with a surprise. Communication is everything. Drop the office politics.

Thu Nov 12 2020, Product Owner,,Former Employee ,Beware - Not what it once was,1,"Great compensation and bonus program. Benefits used to be good, but keep getting worse and more expensive for the employee every year.
","This is a large company and you can move around and find career advancement, but there's a lot of bad management, full of inept and self-promoting egotistical managers . The bonus structure is great as long as it's not a bad year for natural disasters to hurt revenue, but it also means managers will push their teams past exhaustion in order to achieve their goals and obtain their huge bonuses, creating morale issues. And layoffs . . . like many large companies, you are expendable. I knew many people who had been there 15-20 years, get let go with no warning. 

From an IT perspective, they try to present themselves as if they're cutting edge and creating a culture like Google or some large tech company, when in reality they have so much tech debt they're kidding themselves and don't have the the financial or personnel resources to be what they present in their public relations or what James McGlennon promotes in his Forbes interview. True tech talent doesn't come to a big insurance company normally, so it's thin. To make matters worse, they offshore almost all of their operational support to India to save money, but it consistently proves to be a terrible model and only creates immense frustration and inefficiency. 

Lastly, they like to promote themselves as being ""diverse"" and empowering women in IT. This is true . . . my last manager was a woman put in place that had zero IT infrastructure experience, so I got the joy of explaining elementary principles of systems administration while her eyes glazed over and knew I'd have to explain it again at some point in the future. They want more woman in IT, which is great if they're qualified, but they're short-sited on the fact the field is predominantly men. It should be gender neutral and simply promote the most qualified candidate rather than place unqualified personnel into positions just to claim you're ""diverse.""

","Only metrics count, targets are always moving up, so you can never meet them. Extremely high workload, totally unmanageable. Gives lip service to work-life balance, but you go home so exhausted you can't have a life. Pay does not meet costs of living, and any increases are within tightly controlled ranges. Bonuses are also within tightly controlled ranges, and do not accurately reflect actual personal contribution. CEO pay and benefits are outrageously high compared with frontline workers. Office ""parties"" and company supplied lunches are a sop to diminishing worker enthusiasm. Extreme favoritism. Primary method of management is gaslighting and a target on your back. Layoffs, outsourcing, and constant reorganization are the norm, as the company needs more money for expansion. So there is no job security. But it never reduces top management pay or benefits.

","There is absolutely no work-life balance. Management does not care about anyone in Auto property damage, total loss, or customer service. The metrics are consistently set to intentionally being unattainable. Management has absolutely no support for the employees. They will constantly blow smoke and say they are looking into things but never give a resolution. You will hate your life and consider driving into a concrete post so you don't have to go back. If you disagree with anything that management says or have a different ideal opposed to to their extremely high claim volume and lack of support, they will do anything within their means to get rid of you, legal or not. Emphasis on the not legal. Do literally anything else than get into bed with this company. The fire long-term managers who trying to make things better for the staff. They are a negative corporate disaster who only care about profits and nothing about people. Run away. So fast. If you decide to try and take a vacation and they don't like you, you likely will be fired as soon as you get back. They will find any way to get rid of you. I was not fired, I left on my own regard, but I have seen it literally countless times. It's not uncommon to see several people 'relieved of their duties' every week, especially after they go on their paid time off. Also, they consistently 'lay off' massive amounts of their workforce.
Advice to Management
Actually listen to your Frontline employees. Stop blowing smoke of everyone's behind. Actually review and understand how metrics work and why you have an overturn of 38% of employees every 12 months. That's not promotions, that's people leaving the company because you just don't give a darn about anyone.

","Front line employees are used and abused just like most corporate entities. In APD Department if you’re looking to go into Management— good luck. It’s more about who you know and when they’re ready for you to go than anything else. Pay is lacking compared to the amount of hand holding you’ll do for the customer and the stress you’ll have to endure daily with the unmanageable workload isn’t worth it. For most adjusters it’s just a ticking clock till they get fired because their work quality will be terrible because they’re burnt out. metrics will steadily increase and drive you nuts because you’re working your butt off to stay afloat and here comes the new metric to push more work outta you.
Advice to Management
Thank you for the opportunity. I have personal issues to deal with regarding medical. However, claims should definitely pay adjusters a lot more and not give any one adjuster such a strenuous workload considering they will only make about $45k year after taxes if they’re lucky. Not really worth the duress and stressful days. Also, when I started at Liberty I negotiated for more money but kept getting my salary flattened twice—first at the beginning when I came to APD I didn’t get a raise at all and secondly at promotion time in APD I was not provided an adequate raise($1500 yearly salary increase or so)which made me a lot closer to the APD average pay quartile- meaning my pay raise was based solely on what everyone else was making in APD as well as my initial on-boarding salary in RMD instead of my current metrics and work ethic. Not fair in my opinion that I receive less raises over time because I negotiated upfront but I’m still held to the same work expectations as others after promotion. Basically what that’s saying to me is due to your initial salary being higher you will continually get less at raise time, subsequently less bonus and overall compensation overtime than everyone else. Yet you still will have to do the same additional responsibilities as everyone else that come with promotion. Also, everyone else will be getting closer to what you are making because your raises and subsequent bonus will be flattened out to be closer to theirs. My initial salary was based on my experience and negotiating ability so why do I have to be averaged out when I switch departments and/or during promotion within that department. Please change that culture and take care of your people financially so that they can deal with medical problems, etc and be able to purchase things in their life. I was also passed for total loss twice when that’s what I interviewed for and switched to entry level express claims when my bodily injury, total loss, theft/fire, and dealers blanket experience should have yielded me more earning potential. I tried to make it work but when you have anxiety and other medical problems being slighted on top of receiving a very heavy workload on day to day basis only intensifies your anxiety and medical issues because you are not receiving proper compensation for your sacrifice. You are being penalized for your experience, you are being penalized for going to express claims, you are penalized in overall compensation all because you had prior insurance experience and negotiated when you joined. Again thank you for the opportunity and understanding! Retention is key and key to retention is attrition and employee morale. Do right by them financially in claims and provide manageable workload so that they can enjoy life and do right by you. I enjoyed the job when I felt that I had equivalent responsibilities compared to my pay but my anxiety and physical pain only grew as my responsibilities grew but my earning potential continued to get flattened at every review.

","Sr. Management has had same communicated vision to be top 3 carrier for 10 years with no real progress toward goal. 

There is are frequent reductions-in-force that frequently are the result not of changing market conditions as senior leadership wants to indicate, but poor planning. As example, the company completely eliminated business analyst positions with their shift to Agile, but did not address in the new agile model who should do that work. This resulted in severe gaps that forced remaining employees to do more work with less resources. 

The company despite having record profits year over year continues to squeeze expenses using incomprehensible methods. As example, people traveling for work were told they couldn't order breakfast on company dime, while the company would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to give everyone in the company a small branded item or mailer. Not to mention the well published story that the company spent millions of dollars renovating the CEO's office when he assumed his role in 2012. 

While salary and benefits are competitive, your success really depends on who your manager is at the company. Some leaders are great and will work hard to recognize talent. Other groups though are decidedly less invested in promoting talent which is discouraging. 

There are frequent changes in reporting structure due to the constant realignments/reorgs which makes it challenging to not only get work done, but to also advance one's career.
Advice to Management
Solidify on one vision and create actionable steps to achieve it. Quit being reactionary and trying to cover for poor leadership vision/execution by expense reduction. The expense reduction might help your bottom line look better, but it masks the real cause of issues with the company while harming the very people who are helping you succeed. 

Quit rewarding senior leadership's expense reduction efforts. It is harmful to employees. 

I raised these issues through assigned project work and was essentially blackballed by my leadership team. It's why I voluntarily left the company. Liberty used to be a great company - but the culture has unfortunately become toxic.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. I’m sorry to hear about your experience in Chandler. We are committed to creating an inclusive work environment, where all employees can bring their full selves to work and thrive, and it concerns me that you had a different experience. While we have put key programs and initiatives in place to build our foundation in important areas such as unconscious bias awareness and inclusion capabilities, like many Fortune 500 companies, we know we have more work to do and we are committed to doing that work. Liberty Mutual continues to advance our D&I learning opportunities and tools for employees to help us disrupt bias, such as the Race & Ethnicity Collaboration Workshops for managers and Speaker Series for all employees, and Inclusion In Action, a mini-series designed to help all employees further develop their inclusion skills and capabilities. We take these matters very seriously and encourage you to reach out the Liberty Mutual HR Support Center so we can address the issues you raise.

I've had 3 managers in the past 4 months.

Goals went from 35 a month to 80 on the latest commission structure. if you're applying for a normal ""inbound"" position then the goals are over 110 right now.

Pros
Company cares about its people and they make an effort to review practices
Cons
Micro management: you have a magnetic board at your desk moving magnets constantly to show what you’re doing. Doesn’t wanna settle claims so house counsel is overwhelmed.
Advice to Management
Get rid of machines to come up with settlement figures. Let the seasoned reps come up with the proper range so you can settle claims and not litigate so many

","Low AHT, meaning you better be able to talk fast and move onto the next agent on the line. There is little to no repercussion regarding agents, so many of the independent agents dont work weekends, they don't advise their clients that they service the policy which makes customers call in and they get mad when they are told we can't help them unless we are taking their money! Agency is there to educate agents, not process changes because they don't want to! They will blind you with all the extra benefits like Shine Points, waste of money, hire more people or upgrade your systems!
Advice to Management
Close agency services on Saturdays! Update your systems! Using DOS to process changes is not efficient. Actually care about quality service and not quantity! Your Values are a lie! You take people's money for services but don't care to help them. Make the TM's force agents to take care of their clients or better yet, get rid of Independant Agents and sell your own insurance like some other carriers. Actually provide customer service and not a line of BS to get them off the line. 
And management will probably put their BS remark on this. DON'T, it doesn't mean anything if you don't actually fix anything. You need to actually care about the people you service and those who do the servicing.

Sat May 02 2020, ELearning Specialist,"Boston, MA",Current Employee ,Don't drink the KoolAid,8,"SOME team members. Half of the members of my team were smart, innovative, helpful.
","Dishonesty from managers; 50% of your colleagues will be back-stabbing gossipers (and those are the 50% who don't do the work but butt-kiss and play the political game. The reason they feel compelled to gossip is because they are insecure and are fearful of the tech-savvy members of the team. Make no mistake: this company is FULL of polities. MUCH more so than any other company for which I have worked.) 

Why do you think there are occasional ""hiring surges?"" They will tell you it's because they are growing so fast. Don't believe the BULL. It's really because of high attrition; people are leaving in DROVES because of the decrease in benefits, increase in weekly work hours, and overall culture of distrust. Then there are the constant reorgs. There's a reason this company doesn't even rank in the list to ""Best Insurance Companies to Work For."" And don't even get me started on the whole ""locker room"" situation. (No one has an assigned desk, so you have to put your stuff into a locker. What a crock!)

","Employees are not trusted and treated like commodities. Negative culture. Political atmosphere. Favorites stay and do nothing with no consequences. Top performers are overworked to make up for it.

Benefits dropping constantly. Downsizing and laying off randomly. No real positive direction for this company.

Wed Feb 26 2020, Paralegal,"Tigard, OR",Former Employee ,HORRIBLE Local Management,2,Incredible philanthropic outreach. Great inter-company social media platform. ,"stent communication from the top down (soured by twisted manipulation of corporate's message by local management).
Cons
The days of paralegal teams being supported and encouraged their respective coordinators are long gone, with the days now filled by the complete and utter lack of any legitimate respect towards the paralegals by the clueless dictators (aka paralegal coordinators), turning the entire office into a custerfudge of resentment, embarrassment, shame, and paranoia. When office gossip wasn’t focused on the ridiculous, unintelligent actions by the completely unqualified paralegal mangers, a crippling fear of downsizing and layoffs was constant. Liberty Mutual’s corporate group is decent and frankly over the last two years, has been their saving grace as far as employee retention goes (alongside the bi-weekly paycheck). Otherwise, all that is left for the Tigard paralegals are hypocritical, inane, empty words from paralegal coordinators (made only in order to placate rather than aid or improve), horrible office “parties” (thrown by management as a thinly veiled yet wholly detected attempt to boost morale via half-assed decorations and repetitive catering options), and an ongoing loop of naïve new hires to replace loyal, seasoned employees who left with an “anywhere is better than here” mentality or are forced out from tedious/unnecessary/ever-changing policies, manipulated performance reviews/plans, and dishonest managers with too much power but no accountability.
Advice to Management

","The position of legal secretary is dead end and unappreciated. No room for growth unless you move out of the state. Attorneys and management talks down to support staff as if they do not have a brain and only confronts you through an email. They will also walk right by you like you’re invisible, but would ask you to complete an “urgent” task through an instant message. This place needs a serious management change as the current manager is very unorganized and unprofessional. The volume of work given does not equal to the pay. The highest paid support staff is the laziest. Everything in this office is wrong and when ideas for change are given nothing is implemented.
Advice to Management
To SENIOR management please take time to observe the Atlanta office for at least a week. The way this office runs is the most unethical and unprofessional place I’ve ever seen. Turnover rate is high.

","If you're looking for work-life balance, SPRINT for the hills. There is absolutely NO work life balance in this position. Sure, they pay better than the rest of the insurance companies for similar positions but best believe they will work you to death. Not worth it. Worst of it.... they don't let you do overtime! Wait so you want outstanding metrics, great customer survey scores, all claims handled in a timely manner.... but don't want us to do overtime? CHEAP company. There are plenty of insurance companies out there with no cap on overtime. Sounds like you want a filet mignon for sirloin price. Cheapest company I have worked for. They will lie to you and say that there is ""unlimited"" overtime, yet if you work even a few hours of overtime you will get a mandatory meeting with your manager. And no, it's not a ""thank you for working hard"" meeting. Look I am not going to lie to you... the building is brand new, the amenities in the building are great, free coffee, blah, blah. None of it is worth the stress and turmoil they put you through. I have seen people leave this position within a few weeks of working. Training is complete trash. They don't provide substantial training and resources adequate enough for even experienced adjusters to do their job. Just pretend that there is no training. This position bases your 90% of your performance, bonus, and promotion opportunity on one thing - THE CUSTOMER SURVEY. Best believe some customers don't even know how to fill out the survey and as a result, you might get a bad survey score even though you bended over backwards to help the customer and the customer was satisfied. Oh, and it actually happens a lot. And there is NO WAY for you or your manager to ""toss out"" that survey. I've seen some of the best adjusters leave the company because of the fact that there is no work-life balance. Sure, they don't time your breaks and lunches like some other companies do but you will soon WISH they did because you're SINKING in your claim load and realize that you need to skip your breaks and lunches. Why the need to skip breaks and lunches, you ask? Oh wait!! BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALLOW OVERTIME. The best way to explain what it feels like to work here is to imagine someone throwing you in deep water, and you don't know how to swim... oh, and there is an anchor tied to your feet. There is so so much I want to say about this company and my experience here I could write for days. Don't get me wrong, there are some people who do well in this position. You know why? They bend their back for the customers and say whatever they want to appease them. Not happy with liability? I will change it. Not happy with the appraiser? Let me get you another one. If you're fine with waiting HAND AND FOOT to appease customers and lying to them and giving up your integrity and dignity in your life, then for sure ... I DARE YOU TO TRY THIS JOB. No I am not a ""bitter"" ex-employee who got fired and thus, wrote this post for revenge. I am writing to warn you because I wish I would have read a post like this myself, or have had someone to tell me about this position, and understood what this position really was like BEFORE I got hired into this position. If you're looking for a message or a sign, let this be it.

","Inadequate work ratios. Company tries to put forward a work-life balance appearance but it’s forced. No OT unless things are very far behind schedule. Tasks are consistently taken away that would be considered standard work in any other office setting - making meeting annual goals of billable hours harder. Hours of operation are flexible, however no one is allowed to work outside of those hours, even though it’s the request of an employee. Limited availability to occasionally work from home unless you hold a specific title. 

Annual raise is based on a sliding scale system that is dependent on reviews by management and/or other assigned supervisors. Because of a salary cap, raises are usually less than any kind of cost of living increase. The company has strongly adopted the “do more with less” adage - making it a stressful environment. Some positions have no upward mobility unless you want to become management.

I fell I love with this company years ago (when I was in a different position) because of their values and work life balance. They have a yearly volunteer day to allow employees to give back to their communities and support employee chosen charities with donations. Most offices have flex space options giving you a 2-3 day work from home schedule. 

Adjuster role:
Work from home, salary pay, company vehicle w/ pleasure use, gas card, cellphone, all the office equipment you need, make you own schedule.
","No work life Balance. Job is supposed to be a 9-10 hr job but it's more like 12 hr when your first starting out. Exceeding Metrics- forget about it for a few years. Goals are not attainable unless through cutting corners and working yourself sick. The expectations they give customers are not realistic so your constantly apologizing and trying to buy time. Turnover rate is ridiculous and I know they have increased pay and changed a few things over the years to try to combat that but they are not there yet.
Advice to Management
Be honest about the way the workload affects people and become a pioneer in the claims industry to change that. Higher more reps and reduce the claim intake to 6-8 per week vs 10. This would greatly reduce the turnover rate, which gives you the ability to cultivate a knowledgeable workforce that takes pride in their role. 

Provide a different training program for new adjusters coming in with no claim experience. 

Liberty Mutual is a great company but they are failing in this department.

","Company needs to focus more on their employees, proper hiring and the workload. It’s a huge company so take that as it is, you’re basically a number and metric. The workload has become absolutely unbearable since Liberty adjusters started handling Safeco customer claims and vice verse. Of course they say it’s supposed to level the workload but try quadrupling it. Oh, and ya absolutely no overtime, so good luck. 

The ONE team approach each team manager boasts is a crock and pray they like you. If not, that favoritism card will be pulled faster than you can imagine and the team manager controls workloads (even though they claim it’s level). 

There is a reason more people are quitting faster they can hire.

Honest discussion with your managers, fairness related to interaction with local offices, follow the workflows YOUR TEAM put in place, where is our old PM?

The new manager may have tenure, is not a people person, she is not approachable and never seems to have time to listen to the large number of employees in the office. Why did the company allow a valuable manager to leave? It seems that the unit is simply holding on while work is outsourced or replaced by artificial intelligence technology. Paralegals are held to one standard as outlined in workflows, but local offices and attorneys are not, there is a lack of consistency even though that is touted throughout the department.

","Literally everything else I can think of. When I started years ago, I thought this company was one of the best companies ever. I actually was happy for a time being. But then slowly but surely things changed. Like many other businesses, all this company cares about is the money. I constantly hear complaints from our clients about how low we are ranked and a quick google search will show that's true. Consumer reports as of 2019 has ranked us at the bottom, even though we charge some of the highest prices. Almost all insurance rankings currently has us at the bottom. Hmmmm I wonder why? It's extremely hard when someone cancels there policy and they have more and better coverages with a higher ranked company than us. What are we really supposed to say in that situation? The truth is there is nothing we can legitimately say that would make logical sense to the customer besides a bunch of nonsense that that wont care about.

","At Liberty Mutual, job security does not exist. There are constant, constant layoffs at this company. The number of layoffs is accelerating because Liberty Mutual is moving many job functions to India, and they are also in the process of transitioning licensed insurance jobs (such as licensed Customer Service Agents) to contractors that make $9 per hour with no benefits. Management, of course, will deny this, but the writing is on the wall. Management has given the contractors and India representatives more and more work. If you enjoy working under the constant threat of layoff, you will love working here. The CEO even said in a town hall earlier in 2019 that there would be no more layoffs this year, and of course, that was a big lie. Are you a Liberty Mutual policyholder? Need help with your policy? Congratulations, if you email Liberty, an unlicensed worker in India is changing your policy or providing you coverage advice. (I question the legality of this. Coverage advice and policy changes are supposed to be done by licensed U.S. agents) Liberty Mutual does not want their policyholders to know that India is doing the work now, and this speaks to the total lack of transparency at the company.
Also, the front line representatives (claims reps, service reps, sales agents) do some of the hardest work in the company at low pay. Meanwhile, there are thousands of employees who make $70k+ per year to maybe work 2-3 hours total per day and spend most of their day binge-watching Netflix. (Must be nice!!) Meanwhile, the front line is stressing from extreme micromanagement while getting paid peanuts. How about actually paying for the amount of work done?
Senior Management is awful. They are dishonest and incompetent. Senior Management has instructed middle management & supervisors to “coach out” employees who give out low Employee Opinion Survey scores. Liberty claims the surveys are anonymous, AND THAT’S A LIE! I’ve seen several employees pulled into a room to have a ‘discussion’ about their surveys. I’ve seen several responses on other reviews from a Liberty employee encouraging people to reach out to the compliance hotline or have discussions with their manager with their concerns. This is useless because Liberty Mutual retaliates against employees. They claim to have a ‘no retaliation’ policy, but of course, that is another lie. If you voice any concerns, you will be targeted. That’s a fact.
Senior management’s incompetence is the biggest cause of the layoffs. They make horrible decisions which cost the company a ton of money, so they lay off a bunch of people to cut costs. The excuse always is: “We believe this change will better position us for the future.” There is a total lack of accountability with them. It’s frustrating. In addition, Liberty has had to jack up rates to bring in more money to cover up for their incompetence. The result: a product that is very poorly priced compared to the competition. You would be amazed how many policies are cancelled per day because of the awful rates Liberty offers.

Thu Aug 01 2019, Inside Sales Representative,"Plano, TX",Former Employee ,"Make your money and run. This is a job, not a career.",21,"-Pay can be really good. I'd say the top 10% of sellers here are making six figures. With most experienced reps averaging around $70,000/yr. They definitely pay employees better than any other insurance company and as far as I know this applies for not only sales, but other departments as well. Sadly, the best way to make money in the inside sales job is to ignore everything you don't like about working here, suck it up and pretend everything's great. If you can't do that, you won't make good money.
- Working only 37.5 hours a week is a plus, however you may end up working more than that to hit your goals.
- Received a company trip for performance
- Can be good a job if you're looking to grind for 1-2 years just to make money, but would never recommend for someone out of college looking for a long term career.
","- HR doesn't reveal the full truth about the job before hiring you. Our first day on the job my training group was informed that we would be working a graveyard shift (12:30pm-9:00pm) for the first 3 months after completing training. They also said we would have the option to work Saturdays, but instead we were forced to work 3/4 Saturdays a month. 
-Company DOES NOT care about you in this job, only your numbers. Liberty Mutual claimed it overpaid myself and 3 of my team members one month. So then they took back roughly $2,000 from each of us!!! We basically started the following months with negative commission and had to work our way out of a hole. WHAT KIND OF COMPANY ASKS FOR MONEY BACK FROM ITS EMPLOYEES???
- The company is adamant about expecting data accuracy from sales reps, yet can't accurately count our sales! They can see every single thing you do on your computer, and hear every word you say to a customer. However, when a sales rep might be missing a sale instead of going back and looking at our calls to see that we did sell it, you are out of luck. I can think of a couple different times when I did not get properly paid for sales, one of which resulted in the company taking $2,000 back from me. 
- Job mobility and development is absolutely terrible. Many people get stuck in this call center, because top reps make more money than supervisors and moving into another department means taking a huge pay cut. Rather than develop you for an area you show interest in, you'll just be expected to keep producing sales each month.
-Everything you do here is monitored. There is a lightbulb above your desk that shows if you are taking calls or not. Breaks, and lunches are timed.
- You don't get all the same holidays off as other departments in the company. We received an email from the CEO that July 5th would be a company holiday this year, yet that was not true for the inside sales department.
- While the quantity of leads is usually good, the quality of the leads is despicable. You can expect very high rates compared to competitors, and a good number of your leads are just sent to you via some else's cold calls. You'll get treated like crap by customers and cussed out about once a week. Someone will call in about a quote they did online and then as soon as you touch it, the price jumps by 10% because Liberty gives an online discount, forcing sales reps to lie to customers about how the price has gone up if they want to sell it. A majority of the leads have horrible coverage, they are shmucks just looking to save a few dollars. Then when you quote them a higher price, they say ""YOUR AD SAID YOU COULD SAVE ME MONEY! THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING."" And you will sit there listening to them bicker about their ""perfect"" driving record for 3 more minutes before they finally hang up on you.
Advice to Management
-HR needs to give an honest explanation of the job hours before hiring.
-Develop your talent here. You let gifted, and educated young professionals leave because you never ask what their long term goals are and where they'd like to end up in the company, nor do you make any effort to get them there.
-Keep sales goal at 45 each month so sales reps know what to expect. If people make less money during slower months and a lot of money in the busier months, who cares! The constant goal changing just seems like a way to protect the company from paying too much to employees.
-Don't send people a letter in the mail that says we can save them money, and then tell us to sell to customers based on value. If our marketing says ""save money"" our sales focus needs to be ""saving money"". Otherwise it doesn't work.

Thu Sep 12 2019, Claims Manager,,Current Employee ,"Forget ERISA, Just Deny The Claim",8,"Liberty is a straightforward place to work, if you've worked at one insurance company, you've worked here.

If you just want to come in an pick up a paycheck, without having to return phone calls of claimants, this is a great place to work. Ignoring calls, not returning voicemail, etc are all generally accepted, and your supervisor won't hassle you about it.
","The claims policies are designed to result in a denial regardless of the merits of the claim itself, especially with employer policies that are covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, because even an actively fraudulent denial (which happens daily, by design) won't result in any costs to the company unless a US Attorney decides to prosecute..... which they don't. If that's the kind of place you want to work, go for it - it's safe and secure, as long as you don't mind hurting people already injured and unable to work.
Advice to Management
Keep up what you're doing, but also keep an eye on potential prosecutions and regulations. You'll need to make some pretty major changes to operations if claimants get a cause of action for fraudulently denied claims, especially with the clinicians fabricating statements. 

Since I don't think the regulatory environment will change (and ERISA pretty much makes us immune to most fraud claims) we're in good shape in the future, just be ready to drastically change operations if a claim for equity ever gets accepted.

","LM likes to purport that they care about individual employees and value diversity, but the simple truth is above all else Liberty wants to sell itself as an ideal workplace while not needing to put in the effort. Leadership is constantly changing their direction and constantly unveiling ""new and innovative methods,"" trying to sound like a true technology company, even though what they sell is insurance and pretty words. Working as a developer for over 3 years here, I've learned that despite endless technical instability and outdated business methods, Liberty has no intent to change its approach. Just recently all workers in my area were moved to a different building, and are now subject to a new seat reservation system. As someone that comes into the office every day and spends all day trying to do their work, it is obnoxious and inefficient to need to reserve a seating spot and move my laptop, keyboard and mouse, headset, etc., back an forth between a locker and the open empty tables we're now forced to squeeze into. Having any personal items in your area results in directors complaining and circulating emails and pictures of you and your belongings. You are essentially shamed for trying to add any amount of individuality to your area, and are viewed as an unimportant work ant whose sole purpose is to quietly come in, do work, and leave without any trace of you ever having been there. There are a slew of similar acts committed by the company and senior management, but all point to the base result that unless you are a senior manager or director, you are viewed as insignificant and they have no problem treating you as such.

Pros
Flexibility to work from home
Cons
No assigned seats. You get a locker like in high school and have to reserve a desk every day. Not enough desks so you may not sit near your team. 

Terrible health benefits. 

Job security is lacking. Across the company in different functions and areas they are aggressively moving to outsourcing. At the same time they tell us we will get used to and comfortable with this new way of working. Frequent reorganizations make job security even worse.

","It's really all about metrics. Don't help customers too much, or it looks bad for your call time. So basically, instead of getting an issue resolved in one call is okay if you can do it in less than 2 minutes. So, sub par service is okay, because your job is to get them off the phone. Lots of passing the buck. Also, when you start the entire process letting them know from the time of interview about a licensing issue in one state (not the state where I was working for liberty), I was told it was ok. Even spoke to legal. And told since license wasn't rejected, it wouldn't be a problem and we could just mark me in the system not to take calls from x state. Then, I got sick. By that point, I was actually providing""good enough"" service and meeting all metrics. While I was out on FMLA, all the sudden my licensing issue became a problem.

All this churn results in no actual CHANGE. Liberty's corporate culture is stuck in the 1970s. Your manager will never support you, and will always bend over backwards to please upper management. Upper management only understands numbers and spreadsheets, and cares nothing about people. 

Group-think is endemic at Liberty. The company resists independent thinking, and will eventually punish you for having a mind of your own and refusing to toe the company line. Liberty is a terrible, soul-killing place to work.

","Chronically understaffed, lack of departmental and interdepartmental communication, cumbersome procedures, archaic systems, useless practices. In summary this position is a waste of life. 

Interview: The process includes a phone interview and an in person double-teamed interview, both loaded with “name an example of a time…” meandering questions. 

Salary: The range is between $39K and $48K. Of course, they will try to offer you $39K. No one should do this job for less than $50K. Actually, no one should do this job, period. Well, maybe an evil robot. This is an hourly position, however with authorized and unauthorized overtime it will feel like a salaried position.

Training: This is a honeymoon period in which you would have to travel (most likely to Boston) for 2 weeks. Then you will enjoy a slow-paced job shadowing and administrative tasks easy-peasy weeks before the job becomes a brain-eating amoeba. 

The Job: Involves attending useless meetings, getting 10-15 new claims daily, calling all parties and sifting through their lies because an accident is never anyone’s fault. 
Claim 1: “The Earth spun too fast that day and I lost control of the vehicle."" 
Claim 2: “When I saw my parked, unoccupied car get hit I got a hernia. I want a million dollars.” Claim 3: “My hamster, Pepe, was in the car and he was injured too.” 
Every other claim can be featured on an episode of CNBC’s American Greed. You deny a word vs word claim per the company's guidelines, but if a claimant barks loud enough, or has some power, management or the insured cave in and accept liability, making you look like an idiot. You could have saved weeks of insults and aggravation by simply accepting liability right away. Threats of bodily harm by claimants are not uncommon. Insureds act as if they own you. You are a secretary, personal doormat, complaint department operator and sometimes a claims adjuster. 
While some of these things are common in most insurance companies. Liberty does it worse. 
The job is extremely stressful. It is impossible to complete all tasks during the shift, but getting overtime is like pulling teeth on a demented shark. Some employees choose to work OT unpaid (which is illegal) and management looks the other way. Business plans, priorities, lower and upper management change drastically every 6 to 8 months in some sort of corporate three-legged musical chairs that leaves everyone disoriented and unstable. Guidelines are as unclear as Chicago parking signs, and are overruled the second the right dog barks too loud. Sales and underwriting live in Jupiter while here on Earth adjusters need to battle through coverage wars with insureds who always believe they purchased coverage for the Sears Tower even though they are paying premium to cover a bus stop. 

An accurate job description should be: ""Looking for argumentative person to battle gladiator style with customers"". In order to be successful you have to, not just be comfortable with conflict, you have to enjoy it. You have to get satisfaction out of being combative and argumentative like some prosecutors. Even if you enjoy conflict, without support from management this task is like showing up to a world war with a plastic fork. Pointless!

Communications:
You are expected to answer phone calls, mail, emails, and texts from customers, vendors, claimants, brokers and other carriers for your claims and other people’s claims. This sounds reasonable, except for the fact that Liberty is chronically understaffed constantly so the calls, emails, and texts flow like the freezing water that sunk the Titanic. It’s simply overwhelming to try to answer a hundred emails in 4 hours on top of working the 10-15 new claims you’ll get a day plus calls and meaningless huddles. 

Management Support: Standing dominoes on a Bosu ball during an earthquake are more stable than some managers. There’s a manager in particular who likes to call you into his office to see how much yelling your eardrums can take. A death metal band plays at a lower volume than his screams. Half of the office can hear him badgering employees.

Health: Several people have dealt with work-related health issues throughout the years. Empty bottles of alcohol have been found in the bathroom from time to time. Panic attacks and anxiety are contagious like the common cold. Work-Life balance? Ha! There's a generous PTO bank. However, you'll spend your vacation panicking about what awaits when you return. 

FAQ:

“Why didn’t you leave earlier?” Others and I kept waiting for it to get better but that is like being married to the bear in The Revenant and expecting the bear to not attack you.
“It can’t be that bad! Are you exaggerating?” We are not. Ask about the turnover rate. Ask the person you job-shadow how many panic attacks they’ve had in the last six months. Ask them when was the last time they had a full night sleep…sober! Ask who’s not on a mental health medication due to the job. Ask the few lifers left, who have been there since the Y2K, how many managers they’ve had. It's more than the coaches the Chicago Bears have had. 

To add insult to life-threatening injury, with the right creamer, sewage water from Flint, MI tastes better than their free coffee.

The flexibility at this company is honestly unparalleled. Compressed work week is available, WFH is encouraged, and time off is very generous. I left the company with weeks of FTO that I didn’t ever use (and got paid out for) despite taking weeks of vacation every year.
","I wish they would have provided company-paid Orca cards. Commuting in Seattle is a challenge, and most employers this size do provide more commuter benefits (NOT just pre-tax options to pay for the card). 
Sometimes the work is mundane and the systems don’t always work well. Sometimes the IT help line has no idea what’s going on.
Advice to Management
Adding more “fun” benefits would be amazing. An occasional catered breakfast/lunch, more HHs, company-sponsored events, paid Orca card would be great. Did really appreciate the increase in pat/mat leave - definitely moving in the right direction but could do so a little more quickly.

PTO was a little lacking in accrual up to 30 days without the opportunity to purchase additional time off like other large corporations. Before I left I felt there was good work life balance. I liked being able to work from home a few times a week to cut down on commuting. It was easy to work a flex schedule.
","You will not advance unless you exceed your new business goals. It is a dangerous game they play and it'll entice underwriters to game the system to meet their goals. In the same token, it also leaves a big mess to clean up and negatively impacts ability to write the good business. 

I am convinced that I was in a ""dud"" territory as far as how employees were treated by a manager including gender discrimination. By the time I got a new manager I was just done with the whole scene. 

There was not opportunity to advance in this office.

Mon Jun 10 2019, Sales Representative,"Dallas, TX",Former Employee ,Worked there almost a decade,17,"Training is second to none in insurance industry. Pay during training is also very good. They've even increased it by another 10k since I worked there.
","Pay is low. Most commissions for auto/home sales are roughly 10%. That's lower than the average insurance carrier's commission, but Liberty claims to make it up in covered overhead. The issue is Liberty is simultaneously trying to cut the costs of office space for their sales team and making their sales team come into the office every day. They claim the job is ""outside sales"", but you will spend well over 90% of your time inside due to mandatory outbound call events and repetitive, mandatory 30 minute morning meetings. Some offices do not have a meeting EVERY morning, instead opting for 3 a week, but some have them every single morning. 

The biggest problem Liberty Mutual has is too many managers. There are 9 steps on the ladder from you to the CEO, and each step up is even further removed from knowing what's going on beneath them. Virtually the only managers you will ever meet are your branch and area managers. They wield no power over the price of your product and the rules of how much (or how little) you can market yourself, but they have managers breathing down their necks to increase production. If any issue arises, managers can ""look the other way"" at their discretion, but this just allows for favorites to be played, and they absolutely are. If you don't believe this to be true, then you're a favorite. At different times during my decade with Liberty, I was on both ends of the spectrum.

Liberty Mutual management cares about 2 things. Making money and cutting costs. Sales agents are on their own when it comes to paying for marketing themselves, but you can't do too public of marketing (like newspaper ads or billboards). As I mentioned before, you'll be required to spend the vast majority of time in the office so management can see that you are working, but Liberty is trying to push for ""flex space"" offices which have a shared desk per 3 or 4 workers - erasing their argument of why they pay their reps so little. Your paid time off is just based off of your base salary, which after a few years is roughly 16k. So if you take a week off, you better hope your renewals are enough to help you pay your bills, as you will only be paid your low base salary and renewals for the week you didn't make any new sales. And, by the way, the renewals are roughly 1%. You will be worked like a rat on a wheel. You will never be able to take it easy. You will grind for the little they give you until you leave jobs or retire.

They allow for other carriers to be sold, provided Liberty Mutual's initial rate was too high (which is about 80-90% of the time), but the new business commission you make is less than half of what that carrier usually pays. The renewals for the other carriers are also just 1%.

Despite the ridiculously high number of managers, if you'd like to move up you have to wait for them to retire or die, as very few people shift jobs once they hit management. The managers are paid fairly well, have bonuses, and can take normal time off. Salespeople who obtain management positions rarely leave. 

Is it possible to make a lot of money at Liberty Mutual as a sales rep? Yes, but the odds are low that you will make more than 100k until maybe year 3 or 4, and even then, you'll have to work like a dog to keep it, as the renewals are so low taking it easy is going to drop your yearly income substantially.

Oh, and the CEO took a bonus that was higher than the entire company's profit in 2017.

","Huge disconnect with every claims office and the home office. Representatives and corporate employees do not get treated the same and are often not on the same page. This is a review of the culture in the home office.

DIVERSITY! DIVERSITY! DIVERSITY! The home office is so focused on telling you how diverse and inclusive it is that you almost need to ask, ""Why are you shoving this in our face so much? Just let me work.""

People in the home office seem to want to always talk about what they did before joining Liberty. And that's fine in an initial introduction, but not when you are constantly working with them (and don't do it if your previous research doesn't apply to the insurance industry at all). This is different for young employees in their 20s, but when you're in your mid-30s and later you probably should let your college research go. No one cares if you did it at Harvard. Especially if the field isn't insurance or financial based.

Everything moves very slow. Insurance is a conservative industry in terms of financials, but Liberty is even more conservative than the likes of Geico or Allstate.

Being a large company also has a lot of bureaucracy built in. Getting anything in a timely manner is a hassle.

Thu Apr 18 2019, Claims Customer Care Associate,"Liberty Lake, WA",Former Employee ,Excellent Company with Integrity,3,"It's a great company which really does care about all of its internal and external customers. They offer a great salary and wonderful benefits for entry level positions. They are constantly evaluating and attempting to improve their work/life balance. The position offers a lot of meaning since you actually have the power to help people. There are many different shift options available.
","It is a very stressful job for introverts or those who may have sensory processing issues. The metrics are very strict and you need to be able to empathize and rush people along at the same time. It is a constantly changing environment and you need to stay on top of those changes.
Advice to Management
Understand that there are some personalities which do not work well at this kind of job no matter how hard they try. Learn to recognize these people and then advocate for them to be promoted to a different position even though they may not be outperforming their current peers at the time. Weaknesses and strengths often mirror one another so even though this position may showcase a person's weaknesses if you learn how that proves their strengths you may be able to figure out what they would be good at and help them to attain a position they would thrive at and that the company would benefit from.
Practice empathy and direct communication.

Fri Apr 26 2019,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Stuck in another era,11,"Decent pay and good benefits.
","This is an old-fashioned company that says it wants change, employee engagement, etc. - all the right words. But in fact every management process is designed to control employees and prevent independent thought as much as possible. I found it a mean-spirited environment. There was always a sense that you were only as good as your last mistake, and they could always hire someone better than you. The only way to succeed was to keep your head down, yes your boss on everything, and make sure to keep a CYA file. One of the worst places in the Boston area to work.

Thu May 23 2019, CRC,"Chandler, AZ",Current Employee ,AWFUL Company ! No work life balance and a computer program is to set your fate!,7,"They recently decided to let a lot of people work from home in other states, not Arizona, but I think that will help a lot of us with kids, and pets and issues with vehicles. I also think the pay is decent for some roles- but not all.
","Working at Liberty Mutual in Chandler, AZ you will find NO work-life balance. After getting licensed, they still treat you like a basic unskilled customer service agent as opposed to a licensed insurance agent. They just rolled a program called COGITO out which is artificial intelligence that listens to your calls and tells you when you are not doing well on a call with a policyholder. It was designed to tell you when your energy is low or too high or when you are too silent- totally ignoring the fact that we are human and know when to reply and or may have a bad day or medicine or medical condition preventing us from being SUPER high energy. There is constant change, with no regard to pay scale and or the fact that we all have to deal with stats and upset customers they raise prices on while adhering to their policy changes. There is no gray area, it seems to all be black and white. The turn over rate is high and it has a lot to do with the impossible metrics and forcing Insurance agents who work in customer service to hunt down leads- aggressively. There are several supervisors and managers within the Chandler CRC who are passive aggressive and really nasty! They try and pretend and hide it behind false professionalism, but it's a high-stress environment because most people believe they will be fired any day for doing anything wrong- most of us have been here over 2 years and still feel this way!
Advice to Management
Please get rid of this program Cogito. WOrk with employees on Work-Life Balance. Auto Plus reps should be paid for Renters Policy work. Customer Service/ Insurance Agents should get a percentage of leads that are bound!

Sun Apr 21 2019, Information Technology,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,"Good pay, poor environment",7,"Pay and benefits were VERY good, some groups will allow working remotely (a godsend to be out of the office, which is a very negative environment), good opportunity for learning (but offset by favoritism by management) nice office equipment (high quality adjustable desks, nice workstations).
","Isolating, no sense of comradely, poor management, lots of layoffs due to the opening of the Plano ginormous office, limited career opportunities unless you are in the Dover NH office. 
Having worked for Liberty Mutual for years, I found the place to be one of constantly having to meet the never achievable standards to hang onto my position. I felt beat down and that my performance was never good enough. I stayed there for years because the company breeds Stockholm syndrome and that you will never be able to get a “better” job elsewhere with your skillet. 
The Seattle location has moved much of its operations to Plano and it’s rumored that soon, the company will work out of that location. Often I’d speak to claims employees who were just swamped with work. One adjuster said that it’s not uncommon for them to take vacation time only to work to maintain the workload.
Advice to Management
Treat employees better, stop focusing on acquisitions and invest in employees. It doesn’t take much to acknowledge that an employee is valuable and appreciated. This company could be so much better if employees were shown some respect.
