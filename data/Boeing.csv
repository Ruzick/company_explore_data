Advice to Management
It would do management well to understand that there should be more of a focus on improving integrations between teams instead of going with a tool or process that looks ""shiny"". Automation and reduction of manual tasks is a great focus, and the company is doing a good job of bring that to the forefront, but it doesn't mean much if what is getting automated is either not needed or it's only slightly improving tasks and the effort could be put to better use elsewhere. There's a ton of older applications and processes in Boeing, but putting a ""shine"" on it isn't always the best solution. If they want to truly reduce costs and improve efficiency, there needs to be a real emphasis on evaluating older processes and programs, especially the ones that are hurting modernization and contributing to the glut of bureaucracy, by listening to the really smart workers that are interacting with these processes every day and know how much it is impacting their overall work. Once they do that, not only on the IT side but also on the manufacturing side, Boeing will be able to modernize and compete with the best of the best.

If you make a change stick with it and follow through then access. Do not do the flavor of the week without truly understanding it and getting your management to believe in it.

Advice to Management
Backing your lower support group will go a long way. This can aid in improving production, quality of that production and overall body of work, as well as, reduce human factor errors and dirty dozen factors. Stop trying to appease upper level as a ""yes sir"", every request, and schedule. Slow down and come to reality, this line of work can not be rushed; exactly how this mess was created. Lives depend on quality work and properly function aircraft to safely work with the laws of physics. Develop a better weekend rotation system, work flow process, and training courses.

One problem is you end up on a team where things are really unbalanced, for example, 20% of the people are doing 80% of the work. It's happened to me on two separate teams. It's frustrating because you feel like you can't grow at the pace you want to. The annual performance evaluations are also confusing and vague so it's very easy to get screwed over, especially when you're new to the process.

Thu Feb 04 2021, Systems Engineer,"Saint Louis, MO",Former Employee ,Only good if you want to trade hours of your life for salary and nothing more,0,"I left Boeing before the recent Financial Difficulties and Stock crash. However, before I left, it was stable. You would have to completely mess up on an unimaginable scale before suffering any consequences.

Many people who start there do end up working until retirement. Therefore, it is still a good place if your only motivation from a career is a salary and literally nothing else.
","For any people still early on in their careers, working here can be a trap. This is especially true for any software related fields. The technologies used are often out of date and rarely used by outside companies It feels that Boeing floats on it's name and position as a military contractor more then any actual competitive advantage. In addition, the skills will only be useful to a few very specific applications, leaving you will little to gain for any future career growth.

As for internal growth. Promotion is often based mainly on Seniority and politics. Productivity is rarely recognized and even less so rewarded. This has resulted in very low motivation and morale within the company and a ""slacker"" culture. Delays are frequent, often expected. Due to this, there are frequently days where I was paid to essentially keep a chair warm and little more. All this combined makes it hard to care, as the low-motivation across the company is infectious and often soul draining. 

Management often feels detached, as managers only speak with other managers for the most part. I spoke with my manager a total of 3 times during my time there. Once when I was hired, once during my end of year review, and once when I left. Maybe as a result of this, I spend a good chunk of my time working on Initiatives that are very vague and that I don't see any real application for. Projects are often created to follow vague motivations and are abandoned when completed.
Advice to Management
Reward, or at the very least recognize, productivity and results. I am not sure a solution to the low-motivation across fields, but this could potentially start something.

Managers should be able to understand what their engineers are doing, at least on a higher level. Therefore, they can provide more specific initiatives that include real solutions to specific problems. The vague, abstract initiatives are too detached from the project to be useful.

-Exciting work, if you are in the right place
","-You are a number, most importantly, a cost
-Projects can lose funding in a snap if someone up top doesn't see the benefit
-Constant fear of being laid off (see above...)
-Certain organizations, if not most, involve work on legacy systems and technologies that should have been retired decades ago but no one wants to devote budget to technical debt.
-The only way to get promoted or a raise (even more so in 2020) is to switch teams or leave the company and come back. Bonus points if you want to be executive as they only come externally.
-The company doesn't do much to retain and hire the best talent so many of the good resources are on the way out if they aren't stuck with Boeing LTP or RSU golden handcuffs
-Upper management is in a constant state of leaving the company or moving to a different role leaving a Boeing employee with a solid understanding of management's strategy extremely rare.
Advice to Management
-Be more transparent instead of just talking about being more transparent.
-Do something to keep talent. Too many of the good people that aren't tied to the company are leaving due to no raises, bonuses, relatively low or average pay, and much better job security. The best things to do right now is leave Boeing and come back at a much higher position/salary when they inevitably need more people in a few years.
-Though the company is in crisis mode, continuing to treat employees the way it's been recently is only going to drive Boeing further down. Getting rid of the best people through layoffs and attrition is going only making the situation worse.

Advice to Management
Pay attention to quality and what senior trades people are telling you instead of your charts and all the diversity and pc bulls--t. Somewhere along the way you stopped bringing up managers out of the shop and you just started hiring managers. It may work in some cases but you have totally taken the knowledge away from the shops and it shows up like a blood stain. Boeing is devouring itself from within. Almost 20 years as a trades mechanic there and while it was the most money I have ever been paid for the least amount of work, it is quite literally the most miserable place I have ever been. Clicking my heels to have it behind me. On a side note, I would not wish the commercial side of Boeing on my worst enemy. If it was not a DOD job and outside of WA or OR then I would not even consider it. It is very much a shame, I have almost as much time in the auto manufacturing industry and I find it odd and a bit disheartening that a foreign company that specializes in four passenger vehicles puts more actual effort into quality and safety than a domestic company that specializes in hauling hundreds of people through the skies. You guys are so busy watching charts and pandering to certain people that everything around you is burning to the ground. Whatever the charts say is your concern. Boeing deserves every single thing it gets.

Boeing is going so over-board with all the mandatory diversity ""training"" that it doesn't seem sincere. It seems more like a task that managers have to check-off on some 'things to pretend to really care about' list.
Advice to Management
Stop making good employees feel as though you had to call in favors from practically everyone you know to get that whooping 3.5% salary increase for someone. It's pathetic and insulting, especially when stakeholders receive a 50 page pamphlet in the mail each year containing all the salaries, stocks/stock options, and yearly bonuses for Boeing's Board of Directors (which includes the hundreds of Presidents and VPs, I believe). If you reduced their guaranteed bonus percentages and added that money to the non-union merit pool you would see a far greater return on investment from a lot of people rather than what you see from a few select few who take the credit for all the work of their employees.

Tue Nov 03 2020, Structures and Payload Design Engineer,"Everett, WA",Former Employee ,Great place to start your career and spend a few years,0,"Pay was good considering I joined them fresh out of college.

Benefits were great, 401k matching was generous (union), healthcare was low cost with generous company HSA contribution every year. 

Vacation wise, they could be better but considering you can accumulate vacation and sick leave (union), it was not bad.

Back when the company was doing good, bonuses were also a plus (EIP) although not as competitive as other tech companies in the Puget Sound area.

Had a pretty good experience with my immediate supervisors and colleagues.
","Merit increases/pay raises were negotiated by the union. Before 2017, management had a 5% raise pool with a minimum of 1.5-2% guaranteed raise every year. Assuming you were a high performer, you could expect anywhere from 4-7% raises every year. 

After the 2016 contract negotiation everything changed, the raise pool averaged 2-3% with 0% guaranteed raises. They incorporated a lump sum amount which averaged 2-3%. So under this scheme my 4-7% raise turned into a 2-3% raise and 2-3% lump sum (cash bonus). Not bad but not great considering Puget Sound is a high cost of living area with tech companies offering generous compensation packages
Advice to Management
Advice to current employees that joined fresh out of college- Look for growth opportunities within the company and do not stay in the same group for more than 2-3 years otherwise your salary will eventually become non-competitive. 

Advice for prospective employees- Make sure to apply for positions that are relevant to your experience and negotiate your salary the best you can. Once you are in, unless you look for growth opportunities, regular raises won’t keep up with cost of living even if you are a high performer. (Puget Sound).

If you like being given a diverse set of assignments, then that is a positive for Boeing. Each assignment I get seems like it couldn't be more different than everything I've ever done before. Working on spacecraft thermal analysis one month, then requirement verification tracking the next, then designing and building plumbing for a laboratory cooling system six months after that. Boeing does not like to lay off people anymore, (they have a very good severance package), they have had some recently, but they will find you a new task somewhere rather than lay you off if at all possible. Many jobs can be done remotely, so supporting programs in other states without relocating is common now. Travel is usually involved though to some extent when supporting out of state programs.
","You are probably not going to have a stable work location. Any job from anyplace is Boeing's modo these days, which means they will assign people from all over the country to support programs as needed. Could mean you get to work remotely, but with that will likely come travel to some extent. In the aerospace market, Boeing is now trying to force lots of unpaid overtime on engineers to compete with the likes of SpaceX, and I have seen lots of bad decisions made trying to cut costs.

-Name recognition-very few companies can match Boeing on brand/plus Boeing is always in the news
-The scale of the work needs to be seen to be appreciated (the Everett factory, for instance)
-You will meet brilliant people who have solved complex and difficult problems
-You can literally do anything at Boeing-IT to medical to astronaut to manufacturing, Boeing runs the gamut for jobs
-Good 401k match and benefits plan
-I was able to spend a morning trying out our commercial flight simulators by nothing more than sending a well worded email to the right person
-Boeing will pay for your education (undergrad/grad etc...)
","-Like most big companies, siloed communication and politics can really get in the way of getting work done
-To the earlier point, Boeing culture rewards people who don't communicate with others. Heads down and compartmentalizing helps get the work done and reinforces bad habits of those who don't listen to teammates. The 737 MAX program is a prime example.
-Sometimes projects are so big that it's hard to understand what your value to the company is, and if it is explained, it's not done very well (probably because the person explaining it doesn't understand it either).
-In general, information/help can be found, but you have to look far and wide to find it, so don't expect much assistance
-If you don't like working for a weapons manufacturer, Boeing is #2 in the world.
-Involuntary Layoffs happen somewhat regularly, and with the state of COVID and commercial aviation things will be bad for awhile.
-In general, Boeing has switched from making airplanes to making money-which shows in the stock price (up) and the product quality (down).

Advice to Management
People don't leave Boeing because of the jobs. The assignments are some of the most interesting and innovative jobs in the aerospace industry. The reason they leave because of YOU. 
Stop the nonsense of hiring investments unless you have a plan to keep employees- because of the nasty and rude behaviour among you, they tick off employees until they have no other choice but to leave. 5 of my mentees left for your competitors. And I did not beg them to stay either. 
One thing I discovered early on in my career at Boeing is learning from the senior employees, very few of their children majored in engineering, and even fewer wanted to pursue an engineering career at Boeing. I didn't encourage my own offspring to work there.

Given that, your job is to give your employees the tools to succeed and make the company a better and profitable place. Not to put up roadblocks and impede progress, and stop being self-serving. Once you have learned that, then the company just might turn around.

Simple solution: pay your engineers more. When you see your friends getting raises, promotions, stock, and good bonuses at Amazon, Blue Origin, Microsoft, etc... and you are continuously denied a promotion because “you don’t have enough seat time at your current level,” it makes you question why you would even work hard to try to get promoted. This was a complaint I heard from almost every younger engineer I encountered there. I didn’t stay long enough to run into this myself, but the overall feeling that I got from early-mid career engineers is that there isn’t much incentive to work harder. That’s also why Boeing has a difficult time retaining up and coming engineering talent. I think it has already come back to bite them.

Tue Aug 25 2020, Programmer Analyst III,"Saint Louis, MO",Former Employee ,Comfortably dull,1,"For starters you get the usual benefits of 401K, Medical/Dental/Vision, etc. Those aren’t necessarily great but they’re not bad either however as the years went by they began to cut at some of them. I remember when I first started the 401k matching was better than what it was when I left. The health stuff seems to be pretty standard with all big companies. We all get about a week and a half off during the winter times which was kinda nice however sometimes you had to be on call during the break so really not much of a break there. 

For the most part, it was an easy job and very low stress. Some people would get by doing the bare minimum and I’m even being generous when I say that. The technical challenges were very minimal which surprised me. Once in a while we had weekend warrior type of scenario but for the most part it was a very good work/life balance, my work days were Monday to Friday and had weekends off. 

Depending on who you worked under, you had a couple of days to work from home. This was again dependent on management, I worked for a group were we had to be at the office every day no exceptions and I also worked for a group were there was no set policy so you could work as many days as you wanted from home which was nice when I had to focus on getting coding done. For the most part, you would get at least a day to work from home.
","Constant layoff cycles going on. Many times these were right off the blue. On one end, some where understandable with economic downturns and such but I kid you not one time they reported one day they had one of the greatest quarters in company history since 1999 or whatever and then the next day announced a round of layoffs. 

When it comes to IT, the only group they seem to care about is IT Management. If you are technical, then you will always be at risk of layoff. 

IT management is as clueless as it gets. Many of them have no IT backgrounds and can’t seem to tell their behinds from their elbows. It’s funny too how during layoff cycles none of the IT management was ever affected. 

There is no room for new creative ideas which is very frustrating. After a while, it became a trading time for money scenario where I’d go put my hours in then go home and forget about it. 

If you stay for too long, your skill set will atrophy. You will not learn any new technologies and most of the technologies they use are outdated. Furthermore, when they do decide to upgrade to new technologies they outsource that work to a consultancy who then hands over all the completed work and we were then responsible for it on a break/fix basis. So you really never learned any of the new technologies out there. 

There are no promotions and raises. If you want to get promoted you apply to other positions and then hope and pray that once you accept the offer your manager doesn’t try to block your move.
