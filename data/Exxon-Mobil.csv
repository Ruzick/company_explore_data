","This is a maintenance job not a operator job. If you have a P-Tech Degree or real operator experience your selling yourself short. I wasn't informed this wasn't a real operator job when I took it. Very low pay for the work you're required to do. No union protection. They added new job responsibilities the entire time I was working there. The truck driver there think you work for them and are very disrespectful at times. Exxon puts them ahead of you but it's understandable because you're really on the same level as them because you're a maintenance worker. You'll have a foreman that constantly pushing you to do work. (real operator job don't have formens). You have to do rounds every hour. You'll have to be a customer service representative because you'll take all the calls to the terminal for companies asked questions about truck drivers. It's so many negative about this job I can't mentioned them all. All I have to say if you have a P-Tech Degree do not take this job. You'll be extremely underpaid and your experience doesn't matter. Remember this is NOT a operator job. You're basically working at a gas station for truck drivers. It's non stop work the entire time you're at work. That's fine and all but I want to get paid for my work. 

PS if you think you'll take this job to get your foot in the door to move to the refinery don't do it. Your stuck here they won't except your application. You have no room for advancement

Wed Sep 02 2020, Engineer,"Spring, TX",Former Employee ,Major corporation with great learning opportunities but rigid work culture.,46,"Working at ExxonMobil can afford you incredible opportunities to work abroad and be a part of some of the world's most interesting and complex O&G projects. There are tons of smart, experienced, and hard-working people here and there are plenty of opportunities to learn and develop skills. 

ExxonMobil has a very organized and guided career development infrastructure for its employees, where supervisors and staffing & development advisors work together with employees to tailor work experiences and monitor skills development.

Compensation is competitive for engineers. Non-Petroleum Engineering majors with a BS/MS can expect to receive a starting base salary 100k-110k. Petroleum Engineering majors start at ~120k. However, annual bonuses based on profit or company performance targets do not exist for entry-level employees. RSUs are not typically offered as part of compensation either. 

Benefits are good but are becoming less competitive. Decent medical and dental insurance options are available. As of September 2020, employees who work at the company for at least 5 years become invested in a pension plan. However, as of October 2020, the company is pausing its 7% 401k contribution match indefinitely. Salary premiums for working in less desirable locations (i.e. Permian Basin) have been cut during the COVID-19 industry downturn and premiums for working internationally will likely be cut as well going into 2021 and beyond.

The Spring, TX campus (Houston) is a very comfortable place to work at. There are plenty of dining options and amenities on-site and the office space is open and breathable. Parking is not difficult to find. The campus is perfect for a mid-day walking break. Overall, there is not much to complain about.
","The single largest turn-off for me as an employee at ExxonMobil was its work culture. At the heart of this is its infamous ranking system for assessing employee performance. 

Ranking systems are commonly employed at large corporations to hold employees accountable and to effectively distinguish top performers for promotions. ExxonMobil's implementation of a ranking system is ineffective at doing either of these. 

The insularity of how the performance reviews are conducted and what criteria are used to rank employees annually contributed to some incredibly toxic politics in the workplace. The company is comprised of bright, determined individuals, which can also mean highly competitive ones. In many cases, individuals would seek constantly to do what was most advantageous for themselves, rather than focusing on what was most critical for advancing a project or the team's cause. 

ExxonMobil selects employees for promotion opportunities based on these rankings and performance reviews, and understandably, employees react to incentives for career advancement accordingly. 

From my personal experience, I was not impressed with the quality of senior leadership in the company. Many either struggled to or were unwilling to provide clarity about business objectives and strategic direction. They did not do much to foster camaraderie or even inspire. It is telling when you learn of breaking news concerning Exxon's business from news leaks more frequently than from within Exxon itself.

The outlook of the company isn't very bright either. I'd characterize it as a sinking Titanic, while other oil majors (CVX, RDS) seem more willing to embrace the changing industry, are making moves to keep their balance sheets flexible enough to pounce on acquisition opportunities, and have nurtured a much healthier internal work culture.

- Well paid (but completely took away 401(k) match).
- Given somewhat of an autonomy to lead and make big decisions even when you are not a manager.
- Until COVID, a world-class career development path, especially with regard to training.
- Until COVID, you could expect to have multiple careers within the same company.
","- CEO hid under a rock during the most strenuous time of the company's history, then laying off thousands after repeatedly reassuring us there will be no layoffs. Not to mention the fake layoffs in July 2020 (PIPs).

- Forced ranking....ugh...excuse me...I meant the ""new"" performance assessment system (ranking is a taboo term now to make us believe that something actually changed for the better). The infamous forced ranking at ExxonMobil will never get enough criticism. If you're on a technical track, prepare to be the pedestal for everyone in the management track to step over you. You can Google the ExxonMobil layoff forum and read some of the sentiments that people share. I certainly relate to them a lot. Too much to explain here.

- Complete lack of empathy, transparency, and most importantly truth from senior (and many times junior) management. They're very good at speaking fluff language given to them by expensive management consultants.

- The epitome of corporate America and capitalism. Complete disregard to the communities in which we do work as well as our employees. We will do whatever it takes to get the biggest piece of the pie. I recommend you read on our involvement with Guyana and how our top 4 executives gave themselves a nice bonus the day they laid off thousands in Dec 2020.

- No logical long-term or short-term strategy. Basically doubling down on what we've been doing this whole time.

- Spending money on algae because it looks good in ads (but it really doesn't because everyone knows we're greenwashing).

- Still speaking like we're the best in the industry and that we hire the best. This is self-explanatory. This was the world's largest corporation just in 2013...while Tesla's market cap was barely $5B....enough said.

- Being in denial about the paradigm shift happening in the energy industry and the world as a whole.

- Being super top heavy and operating like the Soviet Union, instilling fear into the common folk. Anyone who dares to speak up will be PIPed, especially in the new ranking system that took away the threshold of how much you can drop in one assessment cycle.

- Taking way too long to properly respond to COVID, particularly internally. They had us back on campus in May 2020!!

- The longer you stay her the more incompetent you become (except in PowerPoint engineering of course)! This is because we depend on outside contractors to do the actual work while we boss them and each other around.

- There's much more unfortunately, but I'll stop here.

","- No standardization when it comes to technical projects

- SWEs are not respected; if you want to be a good software engineer, management sees you as no different than the contractor/consultant developer spewing spaghetti code
- Management would rather offshore work to the cheapest bidder than investing in training their own employees to build decent solutions, then give us the spaghetti output to maintain
- Managers haven't touched code in over a decade; absolute terrible understanding of technical projects
- Nobody is an expert due to Exxon's insane 'company knows you better than you know yourself so we're forcing you into a new role every 2 years' policy, leading to massive info gaps and half-completed projects being passed along to newbies

","Culture = some locations have a very uptight/all business work culture that is very tough for certain personality types. The ranking system is terrible in many ways: it makes people afraid of disagreement with management, it makes people focused on pleasing their bosses vs. performing their jobs to their best ability (those might sound like they align but they don't align in significant ways), fear of failure, downplaying/hiding failures, people will help each other but general ""head down, self focus"" is encouraged vs. being more altruistic and improving others vs. yourself. Lack of transparency (especially in 2020 regarding changes in performance evaluation that resulted in a larger number than typical colleagues being dismissed for performance issues, people felt this was a ""disguised layoff"", it probably was all above board but lack of transparency about the change led educated rational people to jump to the ""disguised layoff"" conclusion so I would say there is something base case wrong with perception of management). People in higher level management feel unapproachable and you need to run ideas up the chain.

2 months of paternity leave for US employees
","Just recently laid off thousands of US Employees (myself included) while they continue to hire in growing numbers each year from India and Brazil. They are pivoting their IT roles to a more foreign base and reducing their US numbers each year. 

My supervisor and their manager had no idea I was going to be laid off until the evening before, and when they tried to stop it from happening they had no power. Upper management calls the shots, regardless of your contributions. 

Annual employee reviews/rankings are not accurate or based on the amount you've contributed to the company. You can develop solutions that save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars per year over your other team members and still be ranked in the bottom third for their own reasons which are unclear. 
You are also ranked against a large number of other teams that should not be ranked against each other due to their differences. For example, they will rank support teams against project teams, and all of the project teams will always rank higher than the support team members because of the money saved/provided from the projects vs the support teams requests that don't generally make the company any more money. 

Depending on your supervisor, they will ask what role you would like to do next (for the next rotation period) and put you in something completely unrelated that was not what you communicated. This happened two different times while I was with the company (supervisor kept putting me in support roles when I had expressed interest in development/coding, even after developing multiple projects that demonstrated the necessary skillset). 

Most supervisors are outside the US, and have a tendency to rank their country's team members above you. This was the case for 2 out of my 3 supervisors.

","Management doesn't value differing opinions, and actively discourages change. Ranking process leads to employees being obsessed with showing any mistakes were not their fault and trying to fix only if the solution involves zero risk (which is almost never). 

No clear vision of the future - leadership at my plant flipped between spend no money and spend as much as we can (to capitalize on tax cuts) multiple times within a year for two or three years straight. Once inside it becomes exceedingly clear why ExxonMobil is severely lacking it's peers in earnings and ROI.

In the field, long work hours are prioritized over effective work hours; leadership expects employees to make working for ExxonMobil the most important thing in their lives. 

Still an old boy's club; little career advancement possible without buddying up to management (not entirely unique to XOM). The chosen few would fly up the ranks despite an average to poor performance based on relationships with senior leaders.

Zero concern for environment/communities they operate in - pretty obviously, it is ExxonMobil, after all.

Don't be fooled about ExxonMobil, especially if you are reading review older than 2019. EM is not what it used to be and it will never be the O&G giant. It is a sinking ship and talent is jumping off at any chance they get. Chances of you reading this because you got a job offer in the US is verrry slim - unless you are a recent college grad or an intern. 
Exxon just laid off 15% of it's workforce based on their salary or if they were close to retirement. Imagine losing the retirement package due to a layoff after spending your whole career working hard for the company! 

My advice to you: if EM is your only offer - of course take it. But try to run away at the first good opportunity you get. 
If you have another offer, take it especially if they offer 401k (which Exxon no longer does) 

I used to love working for Exxon but things have changed and COVID is just an excuse. Things were bad long before - upper management is worthless and the CEO is terrible.

Fri Nov 13 2020, Engineer,"Spring, TX",Former Employee ,"Good employees, but management is poor",0,"1. Good health care benefits 
2. Nice office location
3. Intelligent engineers
","1. Management and supervisor heavy (3 individuals per manager/supervisor)
2. Culture doesn't support experienced hires. Every time a recommendation was made that would make the company more agile, profitable, safer, etc. but was different than what they had been doing the past 100 years - the ideas were immediately turned down and it was stated ""that's not the exxonmobil way"" 
3. LPSA safety culture is more cult like than supporting a better safety environment 
4. Lack of transparency to employees - management will approve policies to suit their needs (e.g. increased performance based performance cuts without informing anyone, increasing mileage distance away from work location prior to announcing new headquarters to eliminate having to pay for relocation)
5. Lack of leadership. Leadership rarely hosts events for employees and when they do, they are condescending to employees and show no empathy to employees. Upper management won't even stay at the headquarters with the rest of the employees. 
6. More time was spent putting together slide decks and in meetings, then actually performing engineering work. 
7. Review process is not based upon performance, rather it is based upon managers personal opinion of you.
8. Lack of technology - they tout that there is technology, but that only really means that they updated their version on powerpoint and excel. Industry peers are far superior and are light years ahead. 
9. Managers are convinced that the company has industry best in class everything, however, because in truth, are years behind the industry in many aspects
Advice to Management
1. Clean house with management and supervisors. There is no reason there is a supervisor that is overseeing 3 people. Its a waste of resources and layers of the organization. 
2. Listen! Listen to your experienced hires. You hired them for their experience and expertise. Don't dismiss their ideas and only support old ways of thinking. 
3. Develop transparency for your employees. Stop hiding things from people as it only causes distrust in your employees. 
4. Develop a new ranking/review system that eliminates ""personal feelings"" towards individuals and judges them ethically on their work. 
5. Ditch LPSA - a cult like program doesn't make you more safe. Safety makes you more safe. Put more time into reviewing your jobs and JSAs. 
6. Stop over-complicating things - there is an age old saying of keep it simple. Every process that I encountered was so over engineered and overly complex for no reason. It made the company less efficient and more clunky than peers in the market. 
7. Allow employees to interact with their peers in the industry to better grow the business. 
8. Wake up! By saying that you are best in class - it doesn't mean that you are actually best in class. If you take a good look at your peers - you will realize that you were passed in the industry years ago and are no longer competitive. The company really needs to analyze their peers to develop where they need to get better as a company.

","Safety: A company that abuses a process safety management system “LPS”. You will be spend tons of time doing stupid tasks like LPSA LPO, basically you had to explain to your manager or other people what could be the worse thing could happen and what you gonna go for EVERYTHING! Or observe someone doing work and being nit picky about something they did wrong. 

Work Culture: every little thing you try to improve in the plant you need layers of approvals. A lot of pushback and ask you what if this happened and that. And the chance of incidents they brought up was like 1% chance and nothing to do with safety. Exxon always think they doing thing the best way, in reality, it is not true. And sooner or later they going out of business stuck in their own way. If you make a mistake, they will blow up the proportion and write you up. How do you become the best if you never make a mistake. Go figure. 

Company Culture: they have this thing call growing with purpose, that whole thing is a joke. Then they changed to we are ExxonMobil. It just sounds stupid. It’s all about changing the culture in the company. But it’s just a slogan. Few years later they gonna come up with something different slogan but mean the same thing. 

Lay-off: I know tons of people that were let go but good employees, the company told them they have poor performance so they put them on PIP (personal improvement plan). That is completely unethical and dishonest. A company who has no ball to admit their business not doing well then told employees something they made up to let them go. It’s just ridiculous.

High value projects, lots of money on the table
","Management tends not to be technically knowledgeable but yet still tries to manage - frustrating for technical people who have to deal with their manager's two cents.

Lots of paper pushing especially with safety system. The amount of hours and brain power spent on filling out a form with the right jargon and stewarding the paperwork is mind boggling.

The ranking system both old and new. Always ""relative to peers"" meaning even if you achieved or even surpassed your goals for the year, it means nothing if you are not as good as your peers in xyz (typically means you need to be very politically savvy and highly visible to management to be ranked/bucketed well).

Lack of transparency. We were told there will be no lay offs multiple times. Yet, the sudden large wave of performance based staff cuts that happened in July 2020 seems an awful lot like a lay off...

Benefits are eroding away. No more 401k match. Next to go is probably pension.

The company business strategy is to focus on and double down on fossil fuels. The few renewable projects are really small compared to the fossil fuel work and honestly feels like they're just for show. The hope is that the oil cycle will go up in the future and that will be when we're rolling in cash again...feels like management is in denial.

After the oil down turn that was already happening in 2019 and then COVID 19 in 2020, it is very apparent this company is reactive, not proactive.
Advice to Management
Be transparent! Stop with all the politics, jargon, and buzzwords. If you think that's dazzling enough to avoid honestly answering the hard questions (like will there be layoffs), you're wrong. Your employees aren't stupid, we see what's happening.

","ExxonMobil built up a wonderful benefits package to attract talent and has slowly started to pull the benefits out from under employees. While I’ve personally ranked high, I’ve watched highly talented, high performing introverts sink and even be asked to leave because of their inability to “fit in”. This is not the place for introverts. Management sold the new ranking system as a positive, then used it to turn around and reduce headcount. Exxon relies heavily on brand recognition and the company is now losing top quintile people because that’s simply not enough to retain talented individuals. The people make the company and Exxon’s undervaluing of employees has continued to show in their being out performed by their competitors on stock value, process safety, personnel safety and employee satisfaction. There are hard times ahead without big changes at every level of leadership.

- Technical staff (mainly software developers) have absolutely no career path
- No work-life balance. Because Exxon has let go of a large portion of staff and almost every contractor, regular employees are now expected to fill massive holes.
- Job security = gone. While I retained my job in this ranking cycle, I know several new hires who were let go after being given no negative feedback throughout the year. Job security was one of the biggest pros for accepting a job at Exxon - it no longer exists

Tue Nov 12 2019, Senior Engineer,"Clinton, NJ",Current Employee ,Can you handle the politics?,15,"Pay as a researcher is excellent. That is the only thing that keeps people here. You know where this is going...

Good flexible hours, benefits etc., with some stigma attached.

Highly recommended for those who want a job where they can 'coast' with high pay and little likelihood of being fired. 

Low-stress job after a few years.

Good opportunities for shifting to management role if desired. Plenty of rotational/travel opportunities. Lots of career paths to choose from.

Plenty of smart people to work with and around. Plenty of interesting projects to work on.
","The management at Clinton, NJ has essentially commandeered the ranking system as a method of lining their own pockets and rewarding their political allies. Your 'rank' at the R&D headquarters is mostly just a measure of your political success. I had to see it for many years to finally believe it.

The quality of the engineering work (and innovation) you do is irrelevant to your rank, as long as it meets basic requirements. As a researcher with a PhD, this may cause depression after some number of years, but you will get over it!

Exxon is a top-down company with strong managerial control. The top-down approach to research prioritization produces awkward results. Be prepared to work on programs/projects which appear totally pointless to you and your colleagues.

Micromanagement is very common, as managers were once engineers themselves.

No method of underlings to review supervisor performance. It is a one-way street.

They push a safety program that focuses on fear and what is the worst that can happen to you to push focus. Instead they could help you learn what causes lack of focus and how to prevent it and why it happens along with sharings. They hide alarms because the operators are afraid to alarm due to management documentation of them not being on top of operations and the community reporting releases.

Mon Jun 17 2019, Financial Analyst,"Houston, TX",Current Employee ,Controller’s Financial Analyst,6,"Discounted gas, educational reimbursement, name recognition, job stability (they don’t lay people off)
","Controllers is sold as “rotational finance”, but you will be entering data into SAP and doing accounting/bookkeeping/journal entries. Accounting and reporting systems are approximately 40 years old. 

The “cool” finance jobs (business development, treasury, trading) are given to engineers only, which explains Exxon’s subpar financial performance relative to peers like Chevron and general distaste from Wall Street/institutional investors.

Very secretive and conservative company, not very much diversity. The largest group in Controllers appears to be white males from Florida’s MBA program. 

Low pay compared to peers, finance function is paid ~10-15% lower than Shell, Chevron, BP.
Advice to Management
Try mirroring the rotational programs of other oil majors and include some “cool” jobs. If not, hire only accounting majors or just outsource.

Tue Jan 08 2019,N/A,"Houston, TX","EMRE Offsites & Utilities Engineer in Houston, TX","I Am New, And It Is Not Worth It...",96,"-Fantastic pay/benefits/amenities, especially for new hires...
-If put in the right section, work can be challenging and high-impact at an early stage in ones career...
-Frequent job rotations keep things interesting
-Opportunity for exciting international assignments...if you get picked
-SOME co-workers are extremely competent and a lot of fun to work with...
-If you're the RIGHT person, you will go very far...(see ","
Cons
- Terrible onboarding & training, essentially thrown in the deep end and expected to keep yourself afloat.
- A very obvious work/life balance problem that has gone unaddressed for quite some time (a lot of lip service from management, with very little results). Working to near-death is the norm, and anything below that is considered poor performance, despite what anyone will tell you. Physical/emotional/mental health issues are pervasive and common among co-workers (which they will keep secret so it will not be used against them). 
-95% of the meetings you will have here (in your entire career) are a complete waste of time, and will consider ridiculous questions and considerations with hair-splitting levels of detail, (the ones from my experience) tend to be poorly planned and facilitated, leading to what was supposed to be a one hour meeting turning into a 2 hour lecture of the biggest windbags thinking out loud to everyone with no consensus or resolution...Until two or three more iterations of these meetings take place. Because there are so many of these meetings, work can never get done-this is one of the main reasons why the work/life balance is poor. Spend the morning & afternoon surviving meetings, spend the nights catching up with work, repeat until inevitable burnout. Just remember: everyone likes the sound of their own voice here, plan accordingly...and bring aspirin. 
- Other co-workers are extremely incompetent and make work a nightmare in comparison-if you have a whiff of capability on you they will snuff it out with their toxic personalities and their ability to jockey you around on wild goose chases by off-loading their work onto you with minimal guidance-and taking all the credit for anything that looks good, of course.
- Your relationship with your manager is everything, ESPECIALLY at the beginning. If your personalities conflict in any way-if he/she likes chocolate and you like vanilla-it will be used against you. It gets really nauseating seeing the great lengths some would take to get in with their manager-especially during ranking season...aspirin will not be enough...
- A lot of backstabbing/boot-licking/one-upping/unethical practices among peers, all in the name of ranking, your colleagues are not family, but competition to keep a watchful eye on...trust no one.
- New hires are treated like idiots with next to no capability (common phrase: ""All the new hires know is where the coffee is...""), if you are one of them, you cannot have an opinion, in order to have one you will have to be hyper-aggressive and out-shout your co-workers rather than collaborate with them, or wait a few extremely bitter years where competency is measured by something as arbitrary as the number of years had with the company. When that kicks in, then take those years of frustration out on the new hires under you to perpetuate this stupid practice. A lot of lip service about being inclusive and empowered (""influence without authority"" remains to be a hilariously hypocritical motto commonly used), but none of this is in practice-only the opposite: keep your head down, shut up and take your beatings, and work overnight because I said so. Meanwhile, experienced hires have issues with being pigeonholed into a position and being trapped there until retirement (OR they are rotated at a very slow rate relative to their peers who are or were new-hires)-basically taking away one of the main reasons for working here (frequent job rotations).
- Rotations are great, but they are very rarely planned well (most do not ever happen, yet are mentioned as if they will, and the ones that do give you too little time to prepare) - also be ready to accept something that you do not want nor did you ask for, in a location you were not too thrilled about. YOU CANNOT SAY NO, it's an option...but it isn't.
-Ranking is a taboo subject for a reason: it is an insidious process in that the ones who can influence/change/remove it are those who benefited the most from it, so it will never be influenced/changed/removed. It's typical that incompetent brown-nosers are rewarded in the top third, those who keep the lights on are in the middle third, and the bottom third are those who are being punished for political reasons (looked at the wrong person the wrong way), or cared too much about ""silly"" things such as the ""life"" part in a work/life balance.
-Personal perspective, but I feel like this company was designed for only one type of person in mind, and those who happen to deviate in one or many ways from this mold will have significant challenges to face working here. If you're sensitive, an introvert, are polite, are secure in yourself and feel no need to compete with others viciously, are empathetic, have a sense of humor (and not afraid to show it), are prone to anxiety/depression, are modest, are informal, etc. you will be fighting yourself in the name of your career, you will need to compromise your identity, and the wonderful things that make you-well-you, and fit the aforementioned mold if you want to make it here...A fate worse than death if you ask me: a walking corpse. 
- Youngsters are typically looking elsewhere to springboard after a few years here, and the Old Folks are basically counting their days until retirement...not a good sign.
-From personal experience, the campus-despite being very pretty and full of amenities-is basically a very uptight and pretentious country club, dress code is strict, personnel is tight-lipped and formal, and the conversations you will have with peers are abysmally shallow (on purpose of course, the walls have ears). While the sites have some of these tight-lipped and formal folks, the atmosphere is more intense yet loose with everyone fighting their own respective fire (each site is very different, some better than others, so hope you're in one of the ""good"" ones if it applies) so it becomes as informal as the dress code there as everyone is essentially in the trenches together-these different worlds clash often when they have to work together, just another frustration to add to the laundry list. 
-There are so many contractors here, doing essentially most of the hard work...It makes you wonder if management trusts the competency of their own employees... 
-Bad managerial decisions are made frequently, sadly the excrement flows downstream to the poor saps who will clean up the mess hoping it would reflect well in their rankings.
-Generalized comment, but a very common one among myself and those who I have had candid conversations with: there is NO TRUST in anyone, none. Micromanagement is the norm here (find a study where that is NOT a terrible management style) regardless of your level of competence. Coupled with this micromanagement, everything has a checklist to go through, a process to follow, a list of people who have to approve unanimously, no decision is solely yours, but the decision of a committee on your behalf. Nothing is done by you, just pending approval from others. And you cannot circumvent or skip these process without going through an even more cumbersome process to skip the aforementioned process. The bureaucracy is beyond perplexing, and the fact that people have memorized and defend this is even more perplexing. It's weird how what was an initiative to idiot-proof everything has only lead to an inefficient weapon used by idiots to punish those who think outside of the box...it's a work of art, honestly. While there are new initiatives developed to cut down on this red tape, they are still using their cumbersome and mind-boggling processes to develop this process to cut down on their processes like some kind of Ouroboros...again, ART!
-High attrition rate from the 5-year mark onwards due to these aforementioned cons, who wants 5-35 years of this kind of abuse? At this rate you would not survive long enough for retirement.
Advice to Management
Like they would care that one of their Numbers went rogue and started asking questions to other Numbers to see if it was being irrational. Only to find that it was not.

But for the sole one of you that actually cares: 

-There is a very obvious morale problem, the culture needs a good looking into, a major factor is trust: trust your people, you will be surprised with all the beautiful things people make when they trust one another-one thing they make is better results with higher motivation (win-win)-and there needs to be strict training on inclusion, empowerment, and diversity for all levels of management (frankly from a 3rd party, we're too entrained at this point). Trying to crush New Hires' self-esteem with credentialism (""You're expected to not know anything."") and elitism (""I bet all the new hires know is where the coffee is."") does not seem like a great long-term strategy, and it shows in the attrition data. This training would also prevent unconscious biases from slithering their way into the ranking system, where disproportionate amount of women and/or minorities tend to get the short end of the stick (admittedly, there has been slow progress in the right direction...push a little harder!)
- Siloes : We need integrated teams, not isolated groups that throw grenades at one another. It seems like one section does not trust the data from another section, so a lot of time is wasted on validating what our own people are doing, rather than working closely together throughout the process to circumvent this inefficiency. It's kind of silly that we can't even trust our own neighbors.
-Be More Open: Everything is kinda closed-off and distrusting in general, let people make mistakes, let people ask questions, even let people fail if need be-incredible discoveries (including the ones that made ExxonMobil what it is today)-came from this level of autonomy. In an understandable attempt to remain sustainable for the long-term we have shielded ourselves in a very thick, protective cocoon. This has worked well (exceptional job security, good planning, etc.) but has also been stifling our own potential (cumbersome processes, low job satisfaction, poor morale, etc.). Oil & Gas is known as an industry stuck in their ways, but why not set an example? The motto for ExxonMobil is ""Energy Lives Here"", all we need is a spark from within, why not break this cocoon and spread our wings for all to see? 

There's a reason why I wrote all of this, it's because I WANT to like it here, I really do. I come in determined, I work hard, I want to spend my career here, but until things start changing I am beginning to lose confidence that ExxonMobil is the home I should stay in. 

For the one of you that read this: 
Thank you.

Tue Jul 24 2018, Supervisor,"Baton Rouge, LA",Current Employee ,Baton Rouge Professional Engineering,28,"If you're a dedicated, hard worker, good at relationship building/maintaining, and perform well in the ranking this company will take you as far as you're willing to go. Your promotions will occur quickly and raises to follow. The career / professional development you will receive will set you up well for a long career within ExxonMobil or anywhere else. At the manufacturing level technical careers are not valued the same as management development, so many people feel pressured to stay on the management path to get out of the site to HQ before they express their true interest in other paths not related to management. Folks that are placed into high visibility roles early receive an abundance of guidance and support to ensure success which leads to quick development and promotions. The company tries very hard and effectively to gain great diversity in it's hiring classes. (For engineering in the Southern US I see more women and minority engineers than may other companies).
","If you're not in the top 20% of the ranking and more specifically the top ranked individuals after 5-10 years your career slows down very quickly as do the raises and promotions. The ranking system is not perfect and management perception can carry more weight than performance, even though management says that's not the case. Folks have been held back from promotions that are ranked at the top due to lack of visibility (visibility is position dependent and not due to lack of performance or capability, and can not easily be factor into the ranking system. Or a manager 1-2 levels above has no real direct experience with an individual yet discredits them for some small reason hurting raise/promotional opportunities). 

It is very hard to advance on a technical career path, and many technical folks become frustrated when their management development peers quickly accelerate through promotions and raises without much differentiation in ability or contribution.

Work life balance is not encouraged or rewarded. It's considered normal to work 10-12 hour days. Many employees feel that this leads to folks who can stay at work that many hours regular get promoted faster.

Folks who are not placed into high visibility roles can often be prioritized resources, development, and oversight from management leading to a sink or swim environment. Leading to a lack of visibility and resources to accomplish work which is then unfairly reflected in the rankings.

With the great diversity every year of the incoming hiring classes, it's interesting to see a serious lack of diversity in the site management team (mostly white men, a few women, and slim to no minorities).

No internal job postings. You're held responsible to drive career discussion with your supervisor. Then job moves are generally communicated to employees less than 2 weeks in advance, and if they aren't align with the employee's desires there's very little time time to work alternatives without a feeling of that potentially hurting your career.
Advice to Management
Employees understand your drive to develop the next level of management and the push for the top employees to move quickly. However, don't forget about the numerous highly capable folks in the top half of the ranking but either aren't management development or at the very top. They still need development, promotions, raises, and accommodations of work life balance and willingness to provide other career opportunities and not just reserving all those opportunities only for the MD top tier candidates.

Need a serious revamp of the forced ranking system to systematically eliminate bias and unconscious bias. Inclusion of 360 feedback so that managers can't get away with being terrible bosses but covering up to look good to their supervisors (letting subordinates take the fall). Understanding why minorities and women are not being promoted into upper management / or understand why they're choosing not to accept those positions (work / life balance etc.). 

More effective supervisor training, especially for first time supervisor who directly have the most impact on new hires and their development / potential within the company. Hold them accountable for encouraging work / life programs and employees to utilize HR programs available to them.

Wed Sep 26 2018, Financial Analyst,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Finance Functions,11,"1) Large global corporate structure with many available job opportunities. The majority of Finance job roles (Tax, Treasurers, Controllers functions) exist in Houston. ""Business Support Center's"", that provide primarily transactional accounting services, exist in places such as Argentina, Brazil, Belgium, Hungary, Thailand, and Singapore... among others. Financial management and a few expatriate opportunities do exist for US employees in these locations.
2) Career-long rotation program. Most move jobs every 3-5 years.
2) Interesting work, if you're lucky with job placement through rotations.
3) Stability - you will continue to receive your paycheck regardless of commodity price fluctuation
","1) The majority of jobs are over-burdened with manual & outdated work tasks. This includes, but is not limited to: outdated systems, incomplete/incorrect information, weeks spent on data manipulation, consistent direct data entry (journal entries) by high-level analysts, and the population of a roughly 40-year-old software system to keep track of consolidated corporate financial records. Summarizes and coined as ""Soul-sucking"" work by Senior Managment. 
2) The annual ranking system forces comparisons between analysts, supervisors, and managers alike. Financial rewards (annual pay increase being the only one - no bonuses or incentives other than the occasional $100 gift card) and job rotations are a direct result of how you rank each year against your peers. This doesn't seem like an issue on paper until work becomes eerily similar to a popularity contest for points in the current years' rank. ""It isn't about how much value you generated last year, it's about how your contributions to the company were perceived compared to your peers"". 
3) SLOW to react to internal pressure or external environmental factors. This is a big company with hundreds of individual agendas. Politics are in full play and it often roadblocks potential progress and enhancements.
4) Finance Functions (service line) find themselves on a lower level salary curve throughout the career cycle compared to Engineering Functions (business line) peers. This is an Engineering company, the vast majority of business development, project economic evaluation, commodity trading, and even Finance Function supervisor positions are held by individuals with engineering degrees or operations backgrounds. With a business background (Accounting, Finance, Tax, MBA) there is a ceiling on your advancement, restriction on job roles, and pay will most likely be less than your Engineer peers.
5) Starting pay is based on degree and school (Top Tier MBAs make up to $40,000 USD more over undergraduates for the exact same desk and work product). This is frustrating both ways: MBA's would like to hold higher levels of responsibility and Undergrads would like to be paid for equivalent work output.
6) Currently extremely short on staff and hemorrhaging younger employees due to lack of work-life balance (many are working 2-3 desks).

","Exxon Drilling expects a lot out of you if you work there. If you are not a white male with a stay at home wife, it will be very hard for you to succeed specifically in Drilling. None of the minorities stay longer than 5 years and very few females stay in drilling. It's seen as a nuisance if you take time off to have kids or need to pick up your children because you're in a dual career relationship. All the men I worked with had stay at home wives that took care of all personal things while the men could dedicate themselves to their career. Most of the men then don't know how to work with women in the office because fundamentally they believe women should be at home caring for their men and children. It's very frat boy mentality. I was once told to be more ""vanilla"" at work. 

Majority of ""drillers"" are going to be hardcore Republicans that expect everyone else to be as well. 

Don't even think you'll get 9/80's or 4/10's with Exxon Drilling US. They may have that in Canada or other parts of the world but if you're based in Houston, you will NEVER get that.

The technical and business challenges presented at the company are so much fun. This is the place to be if you like to solve difficult challenges, whether you like to get your satisfaction right away from quick response, or solving deep or broad problems never tackled before.

In everything the company dies, it is striving to be the best, and better than it has been before.

The company has clear and strong values: capped with ethics, integrity, and caring about the safety of it's stakeholders (employees, contractors, customers, neighbors)

","1. Compensation structure is, at best, stagnant. The methodology for finance function employees has dropped the salary curve to levels that leaves most young employees unsure of earning potential and fails to motivate anyone effectively. The inability of senior management to understand that a member of the finance function is not tied to a particular industry has created a mass exodus of younger employees seeking employment elsewhere. 
2. The ranking system fails to address those who lag behind, instead rewarding old analysts with an effective tenure that costs the company 3x as much for a quarter of the work of a younger employee. Ultimately, it leaves young analysts feeling undervalued and under-compensated, while encouraging older employees to put in time to simply work 6 hour days for a lucrative paycheck. 
3. The work fails to engage employees in any type of meaningful way. If you want to come to work to follow instructions in excel and make very few choices about the things you do or work on, then this is the place for you. 
4. Career progression is inflexible. Your career is at the hands of a committee who simply places you where they deem fit.
Advice to Management
1. Pay people in a way that motivates people and rewards good work.
2. Cut people who don't perform at a certain level. If you won't change the ranking system, at least find a way to ensure under-performers don't encourage bad behavior.

","At ExxonMobil, pretty much everyone thinks they're going to be the next CEO, but I guess that's to be expected at place where they recruit with that in mind. This gives way to a terribly homogeneous workforce (even if there is diversity of race and gender - see Advice to Management). In a culture where everyone wants to lead, collaboration suffers, innovation lacks and progress is inhibited. 

The rating & ranking process is shrouded so it's hard to get a good understanding of what's really valued and what is not. Some managers are fairly open about the process, while most are tight lipped. No surprise, then, that this leads to misinformation, speculation and confusion.
Advice to Management
1) Increase the level of transparency in the ratings and rankings process. 
2) Inclusion and Diversity need to be more than just focusing on race and gender.

","Horrible performance review system. You are ranked in groups. A few people are at the top, a few at the bottom and the majority in the middle. It usually amounts to a popularity contest, rather than based upon your actual performance. You end up being ranked by some supervisors who don't even know you and the jobs included in the ranking groups are often very different. This makes it very difficult to rank people correctly. I was in the top ranking group for most of my career but was transferred to a new group. In my first ranking session in the new group I fell down two ranking groups and was told that I was a poor performer. Instead of helping me to improve, they gave me more assignments so that I fell behind. No matter how hard I tried, they kept putting obstacles in my way. I was told that I could separate or be put on a two month performance improvement plan and that if I didn't improve during this time period, I would be terminated. I chose to retire early since I was planning to retire in a few years. For most of my 32 years of employment it was a good experience, but it shouldn't be so easy for a new group to drop someone two levels in the ranking. The new group that I was transferred to had employees who would sabotage and lie about other employees so that they would remain in their current ranking group. It was ironic, considering that the company wants employees to be team players and to have to have integrity. Yet, this ranking systems pits people against each other and employees who feel threatened often resort to sabotage so that they retain their ranking. Also, my group lead had 49% input into my ranking and was in the same ranking group that I was in.

If you are a campus hire and catch the eye of a CL 30+ senior, you can go very far and get paid more than you honestly should by market standards just by paying your dues.
","Upward mobility is hindered currently for the rest. Exxon will give you three years of decent salary treatments to incentivize you to stay. After that, the raises suddenly become nominal -- mostly adjusted for inflation (1-2% every 14 months is typical). The salary bands and promotion scheme is heavily skewed to retain the top 15%. The budget allocates around 75% of salary treatment to these individuals. This means even if you fall within the top 70 - 80th percentile, you won't be getting those ""good"" raises.

It's a lifer company, which sounds good at the onset, but it encourages a mindset similar to complacency since many are not happy with their roles or understood trajectory, yet know they can get away with doing very little without getting fired. This lack of productivity is then absorbed by new hires that are seeking to prove themselves during their first couple of years.

Sat Apr 22 2017, Engineer,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Good stepping stone for grads - only stay if you're deemed a High Potential,38,"-Training is valued the first few years and emphasized by supervisors. Getting in with the right manager and getting labeled a ""High Potential"" (aka Hi-Po) can really set you up on the fast track. There are plenty of executives and managers that clearly got in based on the sponsors they had because they certainly don't have the experience/talent to have gotten there based on merit alone.
-Starting salary is WAY above market value - this can be a huge plus for engineers right out of undergrad but any mid-career person will tell you that the salary bumps end pretty quickly after the first 3 years. However, this headstart can set you up for a higher salary than your peers at another company if you time it right.
-There are some great people who work here and genuinely want to make a positive change and set up others for success. Getting the 'right' manager seems to be the key to success.
","-Mentality that ""there's no better place to be"" - breeds complacency in processes and culture. Employees (especially some baby boomers who are just waiting around at this point) know they don't have to do much to just move along through assignments - anyone will tell you that the only 2 reasons you can be fired are 1) misusing your AMEX and 2) HR issues
-No 9/80s (only major to not implement them - huge con for work/life balance)
-Micro-management -- people are not 1) given enough responsibility, and 2) constantly double- and triple-checked to make sure they've followed the process; there is next to no room for innovation because people are not trusted to make decisions without supervisory approval (seriously, have a little faith. I literally heard a manager say ""I doubt the new hires know much more than where the coffee is""). And do not expect to be in any kind of supervisory role until you have at least 5-8 years with the company - they simply don't believe you're ready for it.
-Managed moves - you do not own your career and there is no job posting system. Any moves are handled by your supervisor who acts as your advocate. They will try and spin it different ways (""this is a great opportunity"") and say that people planning is a two-way street with your supervisor. The reality is that you can put in your interests and geographical constraints, but at the end of the day, if you are in the top 10%, your career will be expedited through targeted assignments. If you're everyone else, it'll be highly dependent on your relationship with your supervisor and the extent of their network. If they don't know about a job, you won't ever find out about it. 
-Mentorship is lacking - it is encouraged among prospective mentees but not much among potential mentors, very few are willing to give their time to newer employees
-Grandfathered medical benefits plan does not have to meet all ACA requirements (ladies, your birth control is not covered 100%)
-Ranking system is tied to salary - only the top 10% really see the big bucks and the rest of the company will start to be paid below market value around mid-career -- it's no secret that during high oil prices, EM people around the 5-10 year mark will leave to Chevron/Shell/etc because the salaries are much more alluring (and 9/80s = 25 more vacation days!)
Advice to Management
Your ranking system and mindset will cost you dearly in the next 10 years. Millennials are not going to stick around because of a ""beautiful"" or ""cool"" campus, or because of recent efforts to push workplace flexibility (congrats, you're ten years behind tech). Millennials want mentorship and responsibility. Engineers fresh out of school are capable of much more than inputting numbers from data sheets into Excel or making ""pretty Powerpoints"". Increasingly, younger professionals want flatter organizations and accessibility from leadership. However, this accessibility is very difficult to get unless you are marked as a Hi-Po within your first couple years or you somehow find a sponsor that is willing to mentor you independently.
The biggest thing that turned me off from this company was seeing upper management tout ""innovation and teamwork"" and then seeing middle management behave in the complete opposite way, demanding proof of the process being followed and balking at proposed innovation. The reason you're going to lose more and more talent to tech is because people do not move up fast enough and because you pit everyone against each other at ranking - not because Google has board games and nap pods in work areas.

","Company evolves slowly due to very bureaucratic approach. ""Old boys club""/""it's all about who you know"" in full effect - transferring through the company takes luck and knowing the right person at the right time.

Need better corporate PR. And need to invest some money into green energy for PR. 
Ranking system should be separate from management vs technical. Generally most agree managers should get higher pay, but should have two buckets, not good for morale. Also we don't see the Chiefs moving to a VP position, so why do so many high-up managers become top technical positions? 
Finally, be mindful of on-going perception of nepotism, We know everything is done within the Legal bounds with HR, but general population can't ignore that many sons/daughters of higher managers get key impactful positions & faster trajectory upwards, to correct this, their qualifications requirements to apply for the company, should be at least higher than the average hired new-hires...not just over minimum cut-off.

Wed Aug 17 2016,N/A,"Spring, TX","Guess in Spring, TX",Honest Feedback for the Company,12,"You can and are expected to retire here with a pension. Not many places can say that.
The pay is pretty good starting out.
The campus is beautiful and the amenities are like something you dream about.
It's a safe company; like the ark during the flood you'll be fine here even if gas prices go to the crapper.
Fairly ethnically diverse for a company of its size.
Perfect employer for engineers and scientists who are risk averse but fairly good with people... you really cannot do better.
They only promote from within.
The company works every decision thoroughly.
","Compensation growth does not even keep up with inflation. People were working as interns making more than folks did in comparable positions with the same degrees who had been there for years.
The culture is extremely toxic; it's more important to look good in front of your boss than it is to actually build wealth for shareholders. I felt like almost everyone there was trying to pretend they kept it all together but inside they were dying.
It's far too siloed. Controllers is separate from Treasurers is separate from the business is separate from Tax. It's like the military-just execute on your small part and don't think too generally (at least not early in your career). 
Feedback is lacking. I don't know how people are expected to learn things without timely, honest, and specific feedback. In my experience, I was doing things that weren't liked in October but wasn't told about it until February despite having regular meetings with my boss about performance.
The main campus is in Spring. Houston is a wonderfully diverse city but Spring is not- at all (even though the company is moderately diverse). It's the suburbs and it's far from the good part of the city. If you like diverse places and decide to live in Houston be prepared for a long commute both ways. I came into work already tired many days.
The company doesn't respect your background unless you're an engineer or a scientist. If you majored in history or accounting or business or what have you and got an MBA it doesn't matter- engineers will be promoted to real manager positions (except for some select functions) even when what they do has nothing to do with engineering. And specifically, if you are an MBA really weigh in your heart whether you can suck your pride and be a second class lemming here unless you studied engineering undergrad. There is a caste system at work here. I've heard it's not like that at Conoco Phillips, Shell, BP, etc. It's something unique to the ExxonMobil culture. I'm not sure whether that piece of the culture is heritage Exxon of heritage Mobil. 
The company only promotes from within so it has a ton of deeply entrenched groupthink. And it is dangerous to your career to challenge the collective blindspots, unless you have made everyone love or respect you. I'm serious.
Advice to Management
You all are navigating an ark in floods that are destroying most everyone else. You clearly know what you're doing. My only suggestion would be to build better feedback loops for your workers and create some sort of mechanism to challenge groupthink and drive improvements for the whole organization. Even if the latter turns up ideas that won't work, there will be a collective learning in the conversation that would benefit everyone. A culture where it's dangerous to ever disagree with your boss can be good but it can never really be great.

If you don't like your job/group, you can move. Although you must network in total secrecy to get something you might want - the official process is a black box.
","After 8+ years of being ranked in the middle and trending upward, my management suddenly dropped me down into the bottom third with absolutely no warning or reason. When I asked why, they gave me bogus excuses that were demonstrably false and they knew it.

I have since moved into another assignment, but I am finding that moving up is a helluva lot harder than moving down - your management has to take points from someone else and give them to you. Meantime I'm missing out on raises I would have received if I was only a couple points higher. I may never get back to where I was, even though I have always performed at a high level.

Any company where this can happen to a hardworking, customer-focused person is seriously f*cked up.

As an intern, you get a project that you work on over the course of the summer and then present to a room of more than 50 managers who will question you regarding your findings. There's a great deal of autonomy in approaching the solution to your problem. Your supervisor acts as a sounding board, but won't hold your hand through it and that's great. At the end of the summer, you know you've made an impact on an important business project.

The new campus is amazing and probably one of the best environments that you could work in.
","There is often times a ""not broke, don't fix it"" attitude when it comes to improvements. You can definitely see the lack of agility within the company, but that's to be expected with a company so large.

","The ranking system is completely based on politics. People are force ranked in a straight line and the ranking is based on your perceived relative performance as compared with your peer group. You can get ranked very low for doing an excellent job because a manager perceives that you didn't do your own job as well as someone else (or they just like this person more) with a similar or even unrelated job. Getting ranked low once is almost impossible to come back from as the ranking is cumulative instead of different year to year. Managers and supervisors don't have your back either though there are exceptions. All of this fosters a hyper-competitive and stressful environment that is counterproductive to teamwork and collaboration. 

New positions or opportunities are usually forced on you as there are no internal postings. Saying no to a position is essentially a death knell for your career despite the circumstances of your decline. 

Work/life balance is non-existent. People work from early in the morning to late at night 5 days a week and people come in on the weekend.

","Not really a software shop, the organization of software development is nothing like you'd see at a company like Microsoft or Google. Sometime a lot of red tape to step through, road blocks that prevent you from using the latest and great technology.

About 10% or so of the law department makes 1M+ and 35% make 500+
","No nexus between pay and performance, pretty bad management, zero diversity of thought (groupthink is rampant), location in exurbs of Houston, pay structure for senior employees incentivizes bad/lazy behavior since 60% or more of one's pay is discretionary and can be taken away at any time, so managers in particular have no incentive to do anything but hide/avoid being noticed and suck up.

You can actually spend your time in a safe hotel, in a safe area and focus on working and eating normal priced food. 

ExxonMobil has also become more competitive on the pay scale increasing their new hire salary significantly in the past couple of years.
","Hours, Office Politics
With high pay comes hard work. No complaints about that because everyone is expected to work hard in return for h high salary. Some departments, however, are more flexible than others when it comes to working from home. After a 40-50 hour work week on a Thursday or returning from travel, it would be nice to just relax and work from home. In the departments that allow this, you see lots more productivity, in the ones that do not, you see people wasting extra hours trying to get something done before they go home.

You can't get away from office politics anywhere you go so just match your personality with your manager's and you will get ahead - regardless of your performance or qualifications.
Advice to Management
The employees do not and should not be mini me's of each manager, they should be allowed to think outside the box and be creative and get rewarded for great work and ideas. 

Also, there are many managers there who take credit for their employees, some of them (most who do not even belong in the role of a manager) need to understand that part of their role is develop employees and not just further their own career. It would also be nice to discourage brown nosing and recognize those people who have some dignity and are qualified to continue to climb the latter instead of rewarding those who follow you around like a puppy.

Though the workforce is diverse, most managers and executives are white, Anglo men. That sends a negative signal to your worldwide personnel as to their prospects at the company and probably hurts performance at the top. Also, be more transparent with employees about your plans for their careers. You might learn something, or even make things better, through two-way dialogue, instead of just issuing top-down commands. Some managers seem to understand this, while many others (who are less respected as a result) take a more dictatorial approach.
