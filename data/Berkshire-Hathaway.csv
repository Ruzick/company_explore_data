Very high pressure to coerce clients into using overpriced mortgage services. Toxic by design - no pay equity.

","Not the best mentoring, once you join on your own you cant switch to being on a team, not everyone is treated equally, top performers get treated better then new brokers, new brokers go through tons of in class training but dont even know how to do a listing or buyers presentation, arent given fair leads to start their business, basically you wont get anywhere unless you are very self motivated, commission for new brokers is low comapred to competitors and there is also a royalty fee to use the name. No desk for new brokers only some shared computers against the wall. A little bit old school. Would rather let people quit then give them a higher commission to stay or work with them to match what competitors give. No ladder to success.

I have aired my complaints before, and they simply go unnoticed.
Advice to Management
Train the employees on how to provide prompt customer service. They should be reminded that the success of the associates within the Corporation, and the compensation they bring into the business, is exactly the reason they have a job with a guaranteed paycheck every 2 weeks, in the first place. If they are overworked or unable to handle the position they are currently in, then more people should be employed to overcome their inadequate level of customer service, which they seem to only know how to provide.

Stop giving out hourly employees personal information. If I could give this company zero stars, I would. Absolute worst company I have ever worked for. I regret ever working here and there is no room to grow. All they care about is recruiting clueless agents to squeeze money out of them.

Sun Feb 11 2018, Ibu Underwriter,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",Current Employee ,Everything good except compensation,5,"Great people, opportunities, and culture. Work is interesting and the company is constantly changing for the better.
","The only negative is compensation is not linked to performance. The top earners are not those who provide the most value, but those who are older and have been with the company for many years. How Guard works is they hire people fresh out of college, pay them hardly anything, and the talented people get experience and move on to companies that pay more competitive salaries. Typically, people leave for similar jobs with competitors that pay sometimes twice as much - even in areas with similar cost of living. A close friend of mine was making $36,000 a year in underwriting and she recently left for a position with USLI where she started at just under 70k a year. We hear these kinds of stories all the time and they are like wild fire the way they spread. Most people I know are actively pursuing another job because of the industry low wages Guard.
Advice to Management
So many things are done well at Guard - most of us don't understand why compensation is so backwards. We have a good combined ratio, yes, but the only way to maintain that AND grow to 3 billion is with a talented staff. I believe in Guard and want to stay with the company, but I currently have two offers on the table and I think I'm going to take one of them even though I'd need to relocate. Both offers are in NJ, and I've calculated my cost of living would be 20% more, but I would earn 65% more in both of them essentially underwriting the same kinds of accounts.

Based on my experience, each brokerage offers different marketing options, much of which is at the tips of your fingers. If you have ""myconnect,"" then that's like GOLD! Systems are far more advanced than other brokerages, which I have independently researched. If you're in an area which has the option of being part of the ""master franchisor"" vs. a ""privately owned franchise,"" I recommend the ""master franchisor"" which generally offers higher commission cuts to high producing agents and many times ranks higher, nationally, which is important to the general public. Training offered through a ""master franchisor"" brokerage is EXCELLENT with the company incurring related expenses, resulting in higher producing agents. How in the world do you survive as a new agent, having to give away 50% of your commission during ""training?"" My office treats new agents very fairly, and we have an excellent trainer. Overall excellent company, I can't speak highly enough about!
","- NOT ENOUGH DESKS, in busy offices which isn't appealing to high-performing REALTORs who are considering the company. - Company generated quality leads (EVERY office receives) being fairly distributed. - Having a source who will give you 100% accurate advice. - Most offices have a small staff, which takes vacation OFTEN or turn over, bringing a lot of inconvenience to the Agents. - Some offices have graphic artists, and some don't which is HUGE. If you outsource custom marketing work to a graphic artist rather than in-house, the expense difference is sufficient so if your office has one in-house, that's ideal! - I don't feel having a manager who's also an active REALTOR is beneficial to the company, making office agents feel there's a huge possibility of the manager/active REALTOR has an unfair advantage to leads, etc. - An in-house TC with 'preferred procedures' clearly communicated to Agents.

I love my manager! He's the reason I'm at this company and is extremely encouraging. I can't speak highly enough of him. I REALLY WISH we had an interactive system to upload contracts, which is easily visible to the Admin, TC, etc. making the process far more efficient, in turn allowing the Admins to allocate their time elsewhere. I feel we're so far behind in this aspect. I'd say the only advice, for management specifically, would be maybe for corporate to have monthly or quarterly management testing on the contract, etc. at the location of the monthly manager meetings, using a secured sign-on so managers are indeed the most accurate source for information pertaining to consumer rights, obligations, timeframes, etc. I rarely have to go to management and I'd say the 10 times I have, I've received inaccurate information 6 times, at two different offices/brokerages. If it's an electronic test where results are generated to the teacher, immediately, and there's a question which the majority answers wrong, then obviously it would be a good topic to discuss in detail. As an agent going to management for advice, I don't want the ""easiest resolution,"" I want 100% accurate information. Most managers have EXCELLENT personalities which is why this is easily overlooked, although still a very important detail. This isn't uncommon for other brokerages as well, although I do feel BHHS is a superior brand and should have the best of the best management-employees as well.

I have meet several employees who have been with the company for several decades which is a good indicator for someone looking for a steady career.

The company does like to reward their employees with company trips, tailgating, and holiday parties. 

Upper management has been very approachable, and as long as you are meeting your deadlines they won't hover over you.
","It is definitely a job that requires you to be an independent worker. When I first started in my department as a Trainee I was advised I would be working closely with one of the senior employees learning the system, and getting trained for the Intro 320 certification.

Shorty after I started three other employees were hired into my department, so my Trainer had to juggle between the four of us. Which isn't really the company's fault since we are growing so rapidly.

The salaries are a little low regarding the amount of work we have to do, but the Health/Retirement plan balances it out.

Since we are so busy it can be difficult to get time off. New Employees are given 12 vacation days and 7 sick days, but I have not yet been able to take advantage of them yet. We are required to take a 5 day vacation, but if you started in January don't expect to take it till November

Ask your RTAs to analyze the metrics for call center attendance during standard overtime and double time events. If you can find a correlation between doubletime offers and cumulative hours clocked in, your employees most likely exhibit the substitution effect.

Supervisors sleep with their agents, some supervisors were even getting married and voicing who they would sleep with. Gross. Their supervisors are lazy and don't help out. Important calls hold and they don't feel the need to jump in and help their employees. 

Upper management would also tell my department to lie to the client. To fudge numbers so that we didn't lose the best client they had. Fraud? Pretty much. Wonder how the client would feel if they found out?..

This place will suck the life out of you. Those who are looking in the Stevens Point area, there's better. Sentry, Great Lakes, Associated Bank, etc. BHTP needs to learn that they are going to keep their high turn over rate if they don't up their wages to be competitive with other call centers in the area. 

This place will literally suck the life out of you. I would rather jump off a bridge then work for this company ever again. I find it hilarious that their 5 star reviews on here and google all come from executives who get paid a very nice amount of money while the people doing the real work live paycheck to paycheck. This is a job for someone who is okay with being a deadbeat who is literally going nowhere in life. Go to school and better yourself. It'll help you to avoid crap jobs like this!

This is only the tip of the iceberg with this guy. He will stain Betkshires name eventually.

Pros
If you are a self-starter, this is a fantastic company! There is a lot of opportunity for innovation, creativity, and networking, but you must be willing to do so blind and without introduction!
Cons
No central network - there are hundreds of Berkshire Hathaway companies that operate independent from one another. That provides great leeway for growth but also doesn't provide much of a source for collaboration.

Sun Jan 29 2017,Anonymous,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",Current Employee ,A Positive Experience at GUARD,3,"GUARD provides both ongoing professional challenges and opportunities for growth. I have been an employee for many years and have participated in the evolution from a small, fairly local specialty insurer to a nationwide presence. My personal role has changed almost as much. The CEO has a vision for the organization, and he has been remarkably successful at predicting the future. Five years ago he said GUARD should achieve $1 billion dollars in sales; he set some wheels in motion, and his goal has just been achieved. As an added benefit, the culture is very tech savvy, so you have a chance to stay abreast of new developments and skills. Most importantly, the company has always attracted good people who keep each day interesting and a pleasant place to work. Many friendships are formed.

(BTW—Kind of nice being part of Berkshire Hathaway – one of the biggest and best known groups in the world. Makes you feel that personally succeeding at GUARD tells you that you can succeed anywhere.)
","Over the years, growth has periodically outpaced the available resources to get all duties done . . . so you sometimes have to work very hard, including extra hours, for extended periods. However, the resources have always eventually caught up with the demands; as a result, you just have to expect that such times will occur and be patient.
Advice to Management
An aggressive approach is good but you need to make sure that enough time is always allowed to absorb current growth before reaching for the next plateau. So far, management has done a good job, but the balance is a delicate one that could easily be misjudged.

+ 12+ Days of PTO.
+ Pick your schedule.
+ Paid Training.
+ Co-workers seem alright.
","- They don't tell you what you'll be doing, till you start training. You don't really get a choice either. Don't want to be doing concierge? Too bad.
- Mandatory over time (Extra money is nice for some though)
- They say you'll be training for 3 weeks, but its really only 2 weeks. You sit in a class watching power points and using ""offline"" based programs (so most of the features don't even work) to learn how to do your job. After the 2 weeks, they throw you onto the floor for ""nesting"". They say a supervisor is around to help, but other people need help too. Not ready to take live calls? Too bad.
- Very stressful. You'd think a job based on ""Google searching"" would be easy, but it's surprising pretty stressful, when you have someone yelling at you trying to find the nearest Starbucks in some big city you've never been to.
- Low pay for what you'll actually be doing. As others have said, they expect gold but give you little help.
- Their programs are slow and crash a lot. They use virtual computers, yet expect you to give someone turn by turn directions on google maps... Takes a little bit to even load google maps at times.
- Communication is lacking severely. They said 3 weeks of training (its really 2) during the day. Normal hours of 8:00-4:30. After 2 weeks, you change hours with only a few days notice to 1:00-9:30 PM, then your schedule you picked. We weren't even told about ""nesting"" (going live after 2 weeks) till our soon to be supervisor asked if we knew about it, then looked shocked when we said no.

Overall? I'd avoid this place.

","- Office politics are a real issue. 
- There is a culture of fear and lack of trust. Different departments don't work well together
- Very, very limited career growth possible. 
- I found the commitment to 'improving' their employees to generally be not true
- Everything is out of date, from the business strategy, to the management style, to the technology.
- I found that most employees were bored stiff.
- It's insurance, so there is a good chance you might witness some decisions that could make your stomach churn.
- The HR department is really inefficient.

They also offer great health insurance, and an overall nice place to work. So much happens on Public Square in Wilkes-Barre, and we're just a block away! It really feels like we're in a bustling little city, one that is definitely in the middle of an economic and social boom! The company is growing rapidly, yet upper management is still approachable, and is a consistent part of our daily operations. Additionally, there are great opportunities for growth within the company, a healthy dose of vacation days sprinkled throughout the year, and other perks such as a summer company meeting/picnic and an annual holiday party.
","Parking is at a premium. There are several lots, including the company lots adjacent to the four main campus buildings, plus a parking facility and a dirt lot both less than a half a block away. I'm told the dirt lot gets muddy. The fee is $13 per two-week pay cycle no matter which lot you're assigned to, which isn't bad, but it's something to bear in mind if you aren't accustomed to an urban campus.

-I love my co-workers and my boss. The environment is fair and everyone truly works to help each other get the job done ... whatever the job may be that particular day, which leads me to...

-Lots of variety. In my time with the company I have done so many different types of jobs and worn so many different hats - all while working in the same department. I think that variety is the reason the company seems to focus first and foremost on finding *capable* people. Since the landscape of responsibilities changes regularly, intelligence and adaptability reign over one specific skill set.

-Flexibility. My family is my first priority. I work for a company that not only supports that concept in philosophy; they practice it daily in allowing employees the flexibility needed to be involved parents.

-Strong executive team. The amount of growth that the company has undergone during my tenure is absolutely mind-boggling. I don't always agree with every decision made, but I've been with the company long enough to have a little faith in those instances. The choices made thus far have taken us from a local mom and pop (literally) to a national force owned by Warren Buffett.

-A free vacation! In just a few months, I will be getting my third ""longevity award,"" which is a free vacation (up to a specified limit) for every five years of service.

","Owners are going through a tiresome divorce and often drag employees into their constant fighting via email back and forth. The wife is verbally abusive and often gives you raises to later take it away as punishment for whatever she didn't like that she thought you did. Had landlords in multiple office show up and calling wondering why rent was not being paid. Offices are often open and then shut down on a whim. Vendors often shut down accounts for lack of payment and even found out our health insurance payments bounced. The list can go on and on.
