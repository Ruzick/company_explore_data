Good work/life balance (depending on your position).
Lots of opportunity to network and meet other people in other departments (even during the pandemic)
","Hard to move around due to workplace politics :(
Also, some departments rely heavily on you to be there. There's no backup plan if you aren't there. Although you have the PTO, you can't ever really use it because you have to be there....For those that actually care about their job, it's a lot of pressure and stress to come to work and never miss a day.
Advice to Management
Allow more opportunities for other candidates you may not know. It's not fair for people to apply for a position when you already know who you're going to select for the position. That's why people leave good companies....too hard to move up.

","Very much a good ole boys system, if you aren't one of ""them"" you won't last long. They will weed you out.
Unfair hiring practices - all jobs aren't posted so that everyone can apply for them. They slide who they want into them.
Not a good work, home life balance. They talk the talk but don't actually walk the walk. Expect you to dedicate your life to the company.

Tom, looking back now it seems Wingo was right. Who was held accountable, and not retained as a ""consultant""? How many jobs has it cost?

","Company has been downsizing over the last 2 years in Georgia Power's operating company and a few other subsidiaries have been sold off - mostly to achieve bottom line results and following a third party consulting firm's advice. Acquiring ATL Gas and Light was a smart decision as they are a ""lean, mean, money- making machine"" for the organization. However, many long term employees across the company have been laid off with no ""up-training"" to enhance their skills and stay on board to be productive employees. Also, minimal to no transfer of knowledge to those left to pick up their work. While operations is closing payment offices across the state, corporate departments are ""re-organizing"" their entire group as a way to release some long term employees and replace them with outside hires or pass the work to those who are left (reducing headcount). It's just not the same company (loyalty) that existed over 10 years ago.
Advice to Management
If you need to reduce headcount in the larger operating companies, please offer the ""Volunteer Attrition Program"" (VAP) that you did in 2009/2010 at Georgia Power. With 10+ years of service and over 50 years old being required to participate, so many employees would gladly volunteer to leave with the standard severance package. Like the prior offering, management does not need to accept all volunteers, but it would be a ""win-win"" for all parties and management could control the timing for the employees' exit and transfer of knowledge to others! It would improve ""morale"" and bottom line as compared to the ""reorganizing"" efforts from the past few years.

","Poor management decisions regarding plant Kemper, Plant Vogel and the integration of AGL Resources has put a financial strain on the company. Southernco's divestiture of units to cover short term losses shows a patterned behavior of leadership being unable to make the right business decisions and their lack of accountability. The primary goal of Tom Fanning's tenure is to keep dividends high regardless of company performance at the expense of long term value. These dividends allow him to explore often unprofitable and unwise business decisions without pushback from the board.

","5 Cons: (1) No work/life balance. Anything from mandatory overtime to waiting up until the week before the holiday to get a notification that you will actually be off and have time to spend with family. By then travel tickets are extremely expensive and shows are sold out. (2) Lack of technology. This company allows the workforce planning crew to manually process everything in the call center, opposed to investing in software that actually talks to each other to process time off and schedule updates. (3)Too Stressful... Drama, drama, and more drama. One of the previous reviews mentioned ""too many cooks, and not enough chefs,"" and I would have to agree. Department management allows employees who've been there for 5+ years run the show. They basically run away good employees who genuinely want to grow with the company and help the company grow. If they don't like you or you don't ""fit in,"" or play their corporate politics game, they will make you resign. (4) Department supervisors are cool, but the manager has her ""favs"" and if you are not one, then welcome to the Nightmare on Elm St. (5) The facility is not clean. They make adjustments when corporate will be coming in to visit...but just on a regular work day it's pretty filthy. (6) They don't value good talent, they are so busy trying to be liked, and having a fashion show. Riverdale GA Call Center

They have excellent benefits, including a pension! The people who work there are mostly nice, and you can move around within the company pretty often, if you want to.
","I worked in two engineering departments, and the training I received was horrible! As a result, my performance wasn't good. I tried to ""catch up"" to where I needed to be after my first year, but I was not able to. I was often told ""You'll figure out what works best for you"" and everybody does things differently. Doing things differently is one thing, but when one person shows you something and another person looks at it and claims it's wrong when it isn't, it can be frustrating. At some point, it appeared to me that I was black listed, and management took a poor attitude toward me. I was told ""We want you to succeed,"" but they were empty words. A coworker of mine who just left the company refers to it as ""toxic,"" and I agree. Also, after giving it a great deal of thought after watching my first annual stockholder meeting, I began to have a sinking feeling in my stomach. I considered all the people who struggle to pay their light bill each month versus, what the company refers to as, ""sales!"" What a joke! The company brags about increasing their dividend for however many consecutive years. Great for investors, low income people, not so much. So, I began to feel bad for being a part of that. Sure, not everyone will have those feelings, and believe me, I'm no bleeding heart liberal or anything. Still, it didn't feel right. Finally, I think this will sum things up pretty well, is the diversity issue. The company prides itself on having a great deal of diversity, which it does, and is great. However, when you're in a corporate meeting of the Alabama Power headquarters with basically half the building's staff, praying to Jesus is not consistent with said diversity. Maybe some nondescript prayer would be acceptable if prayer is necessary at a corporate meeting, but there simply has to be many, many employees in the meeting who worship another god. To me, the hypocrisy running through that place is sickening, and I'm so glad to no longer work there.

Pros
Great place to work in terms of coworkers. Very friendly environment, even though work force is on average older. People here are very proud of the company and its history. Most employees have been here 6+ years and take great pride in their work and time spent here. At first impression, it seems the Company is highly invested in employee development, with mentor programs and employee resource groups. They have several Mentor programs, rotational opportunities and student of the business learning sessions to see and learn about different areas of the business.
","Work-life balance is a sham. At first it may seem that the hours are reasonable, but slowly more and more work is dumped on you. Upward advancement is very difficult and takes a very long time (less than half the pace of other companies). The culture places heavy emphasis on word of mouth and networking. The company doesn't invest in developing and growing its employees. They are seen as worker bees while those at manager levels and above rotate and take on different opportunities. Networking, mentoring and rotational opportunities are quite limited at non-management levels once you really start to understand the Company and its culture. If you are interested in advancing your career and taking on leadership roles, I would not recommend Southern Company. If you want a 9-5 job, put your head down and stay a worker bee, then this place is for you. The company also doesn't encourage diversity (age, outside work experience, race, gender) nor does it value differing opinions.

Cons
Posted a review in Pivotal Home Solutions( AGL and Pivotal are one) 
No room for training new hires, (this doesn't apply to Customer Service Reps) miscommunication (left out of email tree), excessive meetings and trainings and leaves no room for you to complete your task.
Promotions are hard to come by unless you are a favorite
Customer Services Reps are on a revolving door, they are mandated to work overtime, strict hours. New hires, promotions and transfers creates instability and merging, merging ""Dust"" isn't settled

Management needs to learn that happy employees are productive employees. Corporate ethics training practically quoted the biblical ""do unto others and you would have them do unto you."" However that did not extend below upper management. 

And for heaven sake, when you RIF employees, vest their retirement plan. The whole purpose for vesting is retention, not punishing good employees working for a profitable division you one day decide to close.

","I was berated by a coworker to the point of tears on a near daily basis, in front of other people. I talked to 3 managers about the situation, and the net result was me being told that he was an asset to the company, and that I was the one who needed to change. Later came to find out he had a history of PHYSICALLY assaulting female coworkers, yet still had a job there several years later, because he was an ""asset"" (who I caught multiple times sleeping at his desk when he wouldn't answer my phone calls).

Minority friends of mine, who were contractors at the company, were called a racial slur by their supervisor in response to accidentally dropping a box on his foot.

In summary, blatant HR issues were merely swept under the rug and the victims were more or less told to get over it.

I was also not given any challenging work and was forced into a role I was not hired for. I got the impression that Southern Company was a company people joined for the sole purpose of getting good retirement benefits rather than being challenged to learn, grow, and develop their careers. My interview consisted of going to lunch with the hiring manager and a coworker. I was asked maybe 3 experience-related questions and that was about it. Impossible to move up because no one gets fired and rarely ever quits, so you have to wait for someone to retire to move into a new position.

Thu Jan 01 2015,N/A,,Senior Engineer ,Great company with great people,0,"Southern Company is truly a great company with great people. They promote mostly from within and put a heavy emphasis on developing talent internally. Salary has historically been competitive and the performance bonus is typically very generous. Internal Southern Style culture is as good as any corporate culture I've experienced. Leaders are generally competent and have come up through the ranks.
","Salaries have not kept pace with industry recently. Being a large company, it's not uncommon for a mistake in a part of the company completely unrelated to your function to have a large, negative impact on your bonus. Organization structure in most areas is relatively flat, which does provide exposure to senior managers, but also limits promotion opportunities. You often have to take multiple lateral job transitions before you can expect to move up. The aging workforce is in transition as senior experts are retiring in large numbers. There does not seem to be a sense of urgency to replace these very valuable assets, especially on the technical side. Staffing levels are low in many groups, giving heavy work loads and poor work/life balance.

","There are many cons. Firstly, the company is away too conservative and it is filled with old males. The cafeteria in Inverness has around 7 television screens and EVERY one of them is constantly tuned to Fox News. I've heard a myriad of racist and sexist comments during my five years working for this company an it's very disgusting. This is not at all a good pale for a younger technical professional to learn because the culture and knowledge retention programs are so regressive. There is no real knowledge retention program by the way, these old guys just fly by the seat of their pants. I've seen a few comments about how minorities apparently get priority promotion over others which is simply the most untrue thing that I've ever heard in my life. In actuality, the leadership is dominated by white men and there is absolutely no sign of that changing anytime soon. The middle management at this company are spineless and function mainly as yes men. The culture is extremely regressive and stupendously conservative. The company does a horrific job at actually training younger professionals. This is not the place where a young person with ideas should work. It's too stifling of an atmosphere and I personally have been searching for a much better position in another geographic location for a few months. I've gotten a few offers for interviews so let's hope that I can leave this company once and for all!!

","This is the most politically driven company I have ever experienced with no accountability in its culture.

They typically acheieved those positions based on their connections and do not seem to convery the same message and leadership seen at the highest exectuvie level. Accountability is only passed down and not seen at the management levels. The work force genrally does not trust management. These issues are reasons why this company is desperately suffering from failures at many of their current projects. Upper management is not forthright with its people or its Puble Service Commisions on project status and critical issues.

In summary, this company does not walk its talk. It professes to live by a motto of Superior Performance, Total Committment and Unquestionable Trust.

","Huge disparity between direct employees and contract employees. False promises of promotions made by management to appease employees when they have no intention of following through. Company takes advantage of contract employees and gives little in return. Poor compensation and no feedback (positive or negative) from management. Some managers are completely disconnected from reality, apathetic, and borderline incompetent. Advancement is very slow, political, and inconsistent. Workforce is older, with most employees within 5-10 years of retirement. The company does not seem concerned with the aging workforce, nor do they seem concerned with hiring in younger employees. Very hard to give feedback to management when they do not value you or your opinion.
Advice to Management
Quit the contract employee system altogether. Hire younger employees now to prepare for the future. Promote employees who have demonstrated leadership skills into management positions.

","Unfortunately, the culture is more about who you know rather than what you know. There are many professionals holding positions where they are unqualified and inexperienced. In many situations people are promoted or 're-orged' into higher positions due to their relationships with management. It is quite common to have a supervisor or manager that is more skilled on self-promotion and protecting their positions rather than the work itself. Promotion, recognition, and evaluations are rated subjectively. Retaliation is an art. Best advice, keep all personal opinions to oneself and make friends with people outside of the company.

Be prepared to find out that your corporate counterparts make just as much as you, have an easier job and are able to live within a reasonable city. Hard work and actual innovation goes relatively unnoticed and unappreciated. 

You may be able to save the company hundreds of thousands but do not expect a promotion from such efforts.

Long hours are expected and necessary just to stay in control of the raging fire.

The engineers turnover because the expectations for performance are too high and the pay is too low. Draw engineers in rather than turn them away. The ability to keep some engineers will ensure the engineers who remain are more effective and are better able to run the facility. Also, give site engineers higher pay than corporate engineers, we are the foot-soldiers that keep the company afloat.
