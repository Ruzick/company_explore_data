Advice to Management
I have nothing bad to say until the end. Being a socially responsible company and standing up for publicly positive viewpoints is important; but so is taking care of those who helped build the company to what it is today. Find new job placement for your people vs mass lay-offs. Warn them and train them and show Verizon to be a place that doesn't abandon their people when times get hard but they walk the line with them into the red, and make sure the public knows it. Don't hide the red wedding lay-offs behind restructures and realignments, it cheapens what we helped build.

It creates a cohesive company culture through a combination of open 2-way communication, cultivating, valuing and openly celebrating the diversity of its employees, and honest, detailed quarterly meetings--before which a video of the (wonderful) company credo is recited by employees from all around the company. Very inspirational! VZW knows a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage and gives a ton more than lip service to cultivating it. It gives everyone the tools to become empowered and in control of their careers. Great benefits--401(k), tuition reimbursement, health, dental, employee appreciation events, ability to advance/be mentored and more. A Great Place to Work!

","People hate Verizon because they spend so much. They come into stores very angry and are usually misunderstanding their bill or at fault for charges. All consumers hate utilities because they pay monthly for something they forget that they chose to buy. Cable, water, electricity, internet, cellular, there is no joy in paying these so customers are always mad. Be ready to get yelled at. Usually, you can never help the customer with what they need because the company is too big to care. 

Verizon is paying less now than they used to. 

Verizon has terrible top down management. The CEO has changed pay structure to pay less. He speaks of changing with the times and being like Apple but Verizon still offers terrible products in their stores. Accessories and products are junk and very expensive, hard to sell. 

If you’re in a small location, vacation will be very hard to get. They upped the amount of vacation but hard to actually use it.

-Great resources available to learn and improve your skills

-Great office and cafeteria
","-Depending on your manager, you could have no work life balance
-Constant roadblocks to implementing new solutions. Got an idea? Wait one year and maybe they’ll implement it
-Teammates could work from all over the world making it difficult to sync up with one another. There would be times I would be working at midnight (on non-release nights) just to get the chance to work with a coworker from the other side of the world
-An antagonistic manager

I had to take time off to get surgery. I let my team and manager know weeks in advance and sent a reminder the day before with progress reports on all of my projects. The day of the surgery, I was under anesthesia and my manager called three times, with my teammate calling once. I was able to somehow reply once the operation was over. What they were calling me about was something new that came up, but it wasn’t a mission critical item. Once the anesthesia wore off, I was able to get them there information and started to update my resume.

I’ve always worked hard - but this last manager would call me at odd hours over the weekend and holidays. Every time I’d complete something, I was met with negativity and got blamed for things I had no part in.

You might think that the issue was with me, but I’ve been at my new job for a year and I’ve been highly successful with the same job title. The only difference is the coding language and the way my manager manages.
Advice to Management
Managers should be employee focused. Simply getting to know their employees as people can help in getting to know how to get them to succeed. 

I understand that managers are under the watchful eyes of who’s above them on the totem pole, so they need to make sure they deliver what they can. But this creates a hostile environment for the employees which is why the churn rate is so high (at least when I left in January)

","Expects full time employees to be available even when ""off"" at night or on weekends and holidays. Work/Life balance only exists if you work is 100% and life is 0%. Unethical practices in expecting a set sales funnel for 30-90 days out, but will change sales goals in less than 30 days without any warning. The changing of a goal can impact how much you take home by hundreds if not thousands per month. If you don't perform, management's word is taken as law and they can embellish documentation to say whatever they want about you if it saves them. High performers can make racist, sexist, or political joke as long a they perform well. You're made to feel disposable. Sales goal are raised during the height of a pandemic and the pushing to terminating employees has risen despite the state of the world.

","Verizon Wireless had a habit of promoting the best salespeople to managers. This lead to managers who were young without experience and with major ego's.

Verizon would typically change for the sake of change. They loved saying how much they changed, I don't think they even knew why they changed things. 

Typically in a year, you'd have 3-4 major policy changes affecting us. At the end of the year one would still be in place. This was common over my 6 years with the company.

I just could not get there before I got caught in a layoff. It is exciting to learn about the company's vision, direction and how it is using technology to make life better for people. I would recommend Verizon, but only the Wireless business unit.
","Experience in Enterprise was difficult due to constant reorganizations, headcount reductions and terrible leadership. They liked to use the term ""leadership"" in place of ""management"" (ex: ""leadership team""), but the first and second line management of my organization did not qualify as ""leaders"".

Advice to Management
Before the layoffs (aka VSP - Voluntary Separation Packages) began in Q4 2018, at best Verizon had bad work/life balance especially in IT. No leadership, no desire, i ineptitude from middle and upper management to get IT house in order. If you're good at what you do and care about the code you write, be ready for long hours. I suggest becoming better at algorithms and data structures and go search for greener pastures ASAP! After the layoffs in Q4 2018, things went from bad to worse. They wanted to put on me the work of of 3+ people! How the heck was I able to survive that way? The problem is that Hindi people dominate in Verizon, and they're backward thinkers, antiquated at that. After the layoffs there's been a mass exodus of talent, further impacting morale badly. If you're an inexperienced developer by all means go for it and work for the, Verizon interviews are easy, hence a lot of incompetent people get through. Verizon simply has a serious problem attracting talent. Besides IT is not their priority, especially after Hans took over as CEO. This is all about cost reduction and making money at the expense of the lives of the employees, and in the cheapest way possible. I'm so glad I left this place. I suffered burn out and a nervous breakdown thanks to Verizon. I had to work hard to prepare for more challenging interviews elsewhere, but the effort was well worth it. At my new job I'm surrounded by talented individuals, pay is just as competitive if not better, less stress, and guess what, I get to enjoy my evenings and weekends for the first time in 7 years.

You're not allowed to leave until the shift manager tells you it's okay, which leads to lazy employees who buddy with the managers to play on their phone while you scrub the store, restock shelves, and organize the inventory room until midnight every night.

If you refuse to do these shady sales tactics, you will be written up. If you don't hit your numbers because the store is a ghost town for two weeks, you will be written up.

","Be ready to work very long shifts back to back. You're not allowed to leave until the shift manager tells you it's okay, which leads to lazy employees who buddy with the managers to play on their phone while you scrub the store, restock shelves, and organize the inventory room until midnight every night. You will be required to use extremely shady sales tactics which is all about the art of lying by omission to con people out of their money to tack on an extra couple hundred in accessory sales. If you refuse to do these shady sales tactics, you will be written up. If you don't hit your numbers because the store is a ghost town for two weeks, you will be written up. Be prepared to have your leads snaked out from under you by peers that tell your appointments you're busy and never notify you that they arrived. Accept that management will either ask them to split the sale 50/50, or just do nothing.
Advice to Management
Cut the shady practices. Encourage sales with integrity and understand that when the economy is tanking, people shouldn't be shaken down for their last pennies to buy your stupid speakers and battery packs.

","very psychologically demanding, working non stop, no down time, you have to play the uplifting role non stop with the customers, calls were generally 3 to 5 minutes and there was at least 15 things you had to incorporate into each call, calls were randomly selected for grading, very stressful, calls come in back to back, there was not adequate training I worked there for a year and a half and never felt fully competent, your schedule also changes randomly every 6 months there is a schedule bid and people who have been there longer have priority over newer employees, there is also no privacy as the call center is essentially a bunch of desks side by side about 200 on two separate floors, you definitely need all the paid time off because you cannot perform at all at the level you need to be at with any kind of illness or feeling down
Advice to Management
I no not think management can help, the nature of the job is the issue, but maybe allowing a few moments in-between each call would ease the pressure of the job, also putting employees in teams and having award certificates every month or so is unnecessary (I regularly got certificates for leading dollars per hour and I dreaded those days because I did not want the attention and it made some people who are competitive feel bad) It also made me feel like I was back in middle or elementary school

Reduce the bureaucracy by looking at all the inefficiencies within your internal systems. Things like audits are essential and should be done, but the way to execute them should be appropriate, so please look at the implementation of your internal systems and processes, because they are very poorly implemented.

Thank you for your review. At Verizon, we keep our commitments to each other and our customers, and we go to great lengths in order to promote a culture of respect and trust. We appreciate your feedback and urge you to reach out to your HR business partner with your concerns","Wipe the board and start from scratch. Start appreciating and listening to the new workforce, that is terrified to speak up and get transferred to a far away garage. 
2.0 frontline management is not working. To my knowledge, about 66% of LMs under my director are actively seeking other jobs. It seems like most of our conversations are about how stressed we are and how we're trying to leave this job.

At this point, if you had any more time in your week that has already felt like 45 hours, then you could work with and coach your team. Verizon eliminated a position in their stores that made managers turn into administrative assistants. All of this, combined with the fact that the DM's don't care about the development of their managers leads to an unbearable work environment.
Advice to Management
You have to find a way to give more time back to Solutions Managers to actually lead and manage to help their employees grow in their role. You also have to train them on how to do it! Rather than just throwing them in the stores and saying, ""best of luck, go deal with that yelling fool at the back counter.""

","Any retail end position from sales rep to general manager is going to very quickly burn you out. The company constantly increases sales goals while removing incentive to sell. Earnable commission payouts drop every year, and the expectation for sales is high. It has come to a point at which earning half the yearly salary which was possible three years ago is no longer realistically possible, and Verizon is loving the savings.

Excellent at going to market. Great job if you are looking to get B2B sales on your resume. But, don't expect leaders to help you get promoted. So, it's good for 2 or 3 years max.
","Constant quota changes. Many people felt like they were just ""stuck"" in a role in the Business Channel. People that were promoted had to interview 3 or 4 times, and would still get turned down, but encouraged to come back and try again. I had a leader ask me to schedule one on one time to discuss potential career paths. Instead of help guiding me with where he/she saw fit, I was told ""you will need to decide"". Each role had a different progression as one was staying in sales as individual contributor, and the other was management. I was looking for guidance.
Advice to Management
Put leaders in place who have a genuine concern for their teams advancements. Every new hire should be considered as bench for something to progress to. Senior or regionals should spot check their current business managers, or should share a random day in the life. You may be surprised how unpolished and insensitive your leaders come across to their reps. At times very rude and condinscending. Be upfront, and you will get more out of your reps.

You manage your own time and can make 4K monthly in commission. Verizon offers good benefits, 401k and many other helpful tools
","The expectation when I was hired on was 20 cold calls per morning, then meetings from 10-12, 1-3, then floor time from 3-5 in your store. Since Covid, the expectation of cold calls has risen between 30-45, and the expectations of hitting our same metrics is expected. We are working from home and without being able to get out and socialize, at least in my opinion it has been a struggle. Verizon is also a liberal company, and unfortunately I felt like political agendas were pushed. From encouraging people to go march for trans-rights to adding “racial inequality” to our Voluntary trainings with headlines such as “why talk about whiteness”. I’m not saying I’m not for equal rights or anything of the kind, but if there was a march for conservatives, or a pro life rally it would definitely not be advocated and would probably be looked down upon.

As person who worked here after college with a regular 4 year degree, I was able to make $65-$80K a year simply due to the fact that people NEED phones. 
Great matching 401K and benefits - compared to other companies I've worked for, you could actually make 1 million by retirement here especially if you start here before 25 years old 
I had great District Managers in my zone
","Retail - long hours, OT is encouraged so this is a pro/con 
Weekends are no longer a word in your life, working here for 4 years I forgot what having weekends off to spend time with family was 
Not many holidays off because this is a retail position, in exchange you get more money but at the expense of losing ""You"" time.
Stressful quota, even worse if you have a Manager that likes to micromange you. 
The path to move up in this company if you come from retail are 2 ways: 1.) Retail Rep -> Assistant Manager (Probably the most stressful) -> Store GM -> and then you can move to other positions easier. 2.) You can leave and move to business sales as an AE, this path is great if you'd like to really generate close to 6 figures, and it is probably the better path for those who enjoy sales since Technology AEs from other companies such as HP, Dell, SAP, ATT, TMobile usually get paid 100,000+ if you're good at your job.

Fri Jul 10 2020, Senior Client Executive,"Basking Ridge, NJ",Current Employee ,Good company,0,"Solid company with a lot of stability in the marketplace. Operates at the premium end of the telecommunications sector with aspirations to become a technology giant like Google, Amazon, and others -- but still several years away (~10 years) from truly approaching that aspiration. Many incredibly smart people who have been at Verizon for 10+ years, and understand the business operations at a near personal level.
","The company is not quite streamlined in its operations. Many of its processes are slow or broken, and in need of operational excellence initiatives to drive improvement and employee productivity. However, leadership is receptive to new ideas and suggestions on where and how to drive improvement, so any issue has a corresponding solution.

The company is diverse and tries its best to address the multitude of complex social and political issues in a way that is not cringe inducing, nor tending towards isolation of its employees or customer base.

Not quite a technology company that it would have you believe, but certainly a strong performer in the telecom and media spaces.

Not firing any employees during the pandemic and modifying their operations in a very short period of time to protect employees and customers for an organization of its size is impressive. Hans has changed Verizon for the better he is a great CEO. Verizon is a company you can make a career at.
