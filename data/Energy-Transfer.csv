Pay is near the upper-end of the spectrum with respect to metropolitan area employees
","Some managers are less technical than the position would require resulting in questionable decisions on occasion, but issues resulting from these decisions are usually rectified quickly. Employees tend to be localized to a particular subset of tasks (i.e. a team may have several technologies for which they are responsible but will structure support so that team member A will handle all tickets for technology A and team member B will handle all tickets for technology B etc.) As a result, it is incumbent upon the individual to stay current with respect to technologies that may be within their purview, but they will not have hands-on with as it is assigned to another member of their team.

","The company is full of ""apple polishers"". Those types of people spend all day chatting it up with management, and in the end, are the people who get promoted. My manager would spend all day away from his/her desk, only to leave early every week to either take his/her kids to classes, or just because. My manager even once scheduled an appointment for a massage at 10:30am?!? He/she habitually came in to work later than me, and left work earlier than me on most days. My manager got away with a lot because she was chummy with the Controller (or anyone else who might have benefited them.)

My manager let me have a good work/life balance for a while. Working from home as needed, tending to appointments and what not, until I went to HR to complain of some issues with him/her. Then everything changed once I brought to light everything he/she was getting away with. 

Needless to say at this company, if you ""go with the flow"" when you're manager is getting away with murder, you'll be good. BUT go against your manager, and face the wrath.

Company cares little about the worker bees, or how much overtime they work, or if the workload is overbearing. Zip your lips if the workload is too much, because that will surely be frowned upon once bonus/merit increases come around.

There's little to no room for advancement. Bonuses and merit increases are a joke. Unless you part the red sea, your work is always considered mediocre.

","There is a general lack of guidance and support from management. Maybe this is because of the quality of people they promote - based more on who their favorites are than ability or performance. When you raise issues, promises are made but not followed through on.

Be careful during your interview for this company; they can be misleading when describing your workload, your job duties, travel amounts, etc. My experience was completely different than what was discussed in my interview. When I spoke with my supervisor about this (multiple times), promises were made to fix this, but there was absolutely no follow through. It is clear I was just being told what I wanted to hear in order to stay longer.

Fri May 29 2015,N/A,, ,Good company with poor management,7,"I work with some great co-workers, the benefits are good, and the pay is decent Although not on part with other companies (or even other offices 30 minutes away).
SXL is typically a good place to learn because you will be faced with a great deal of projects and responsibilities. On the flip side it is basically just a training ground for the competition.
","First, just to be clear...this only pertains to my location. I know many other employees in other areas that are not faced with the same issues our office is. I am not convinced SXL is bad, just some certain offices.

Poor management at my location, also lots of micromanagement. There is constant turnover of employees due to this, and nobody in upper management or HR seems to care why so many people leave. Our pay has been below other places within the company and we are told ""you aren't paid as much because you have a great deal of freedom on the pipeline"". However, we are faced with a great deal of responsibility. 

The district manager will lie to your face without even batting an eye, but somehow always comes out smelling like a rose. We are very understaffed, therefore we work a significant amount of overtime which is their expectation. Overtime is NOT optional. You are expected to be available 24/7 with no on call pay, shift differential, etc. Management refuses to begin an alternative work schedule to have 24 hour coverage so that we could have scheduled days off. Our management is also very cheap, refusing to buy updated equipment to help us perform at their high level of expectations. They will ask you to travel out of town for an extended time, and will pay for your meals, hotel, etc. but if you tip slightly over their limit(i.e.: $3.00 instead of $2.96) you will be asked to pay those few pennies back to the company via a money order that costs more than the little bit you owe. What a great way to show your appreciation to an employee who went above and beyond to help another district!! 

Safety is talked about constantly, but seldom shows its importance on the job. Production takes the priority, and safety is usually seen in hindsight. Management says otherwise, but when it comes down to it their actions say something different. You definitely have to be your brothers keeper because the safety department is basically non-existent. They are smothered by management as well.

Oh, and they have meetings about meetings. There is alot of inefficiency and ""career justification"" that goes on.
Advice to Management
Pay better attention to your first line supervision and district managers. If you repeatedly see job postings at one location, you should probably investigate why so many people leave the company or transfer. It is pathetic when your senior person in the crew has been with the company less that 4 years. Talk to people in the field, send out surveys, do something to find out where the problem lies. If you expect your assets to be online 24/7/365, you need to hire more people. Consider alternative shift schedules for field employees like you do your operators. This can also help your safety record improve because you won't be working people 16+ hours per day. You have to stop your poor boy oil field mentality. You want to be a billion dollar company? Act like one. Make sure your company values are in check all the way through the ranks, because I promise you that you are being fooled by middle management.

Thu Oct 09 2014,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,My review and opinion of Energy Transfer Partners as a former employee,2,"Most field employees are wonderful to work with; you feel like you are working with family! Lower levels of management (from field supervisors to Vice Presidents of the individual companies) are like every company: some are GREAT and some are on power trips and may be better utilized in administrative positions than in positions of authority. Benefits and pay are par for the industry. As far as the upper management is concerned, the company seems to be well managed and focused on providing reliable service to their customers. There is an excellent opportunity for training and on the job learning. Over all Pay raises for job classifications are good, but individual raises in a certain job are based on progressing through skill families by being ""signed off' by other employees already in that family. I have seen people that are qualified not getting signed off because of, what appeared to me as, personal issues; conversely, I have seen people getting signed off that, in my opinion, need more on the job experience as well as formal training because of friendships with the evaluator.
","The work/life balance is not good for some employees in the field. Certain locations and job positions are busy and always getting called out as well as being required to travel extensively. Safety is preached, but I have seen it become secondary to reliability on many occasions. This can be a fast paced, highly stressful environment. There also seems to be pressure to contribute to their PAC.

If I were running the company, I would ask for anonymous upward feedback from employees on their managers as part of the managers regular performance reviews.

Being on the legacy end will most likely result in loosing your job and being belittled. The acquired company's IT doesn't understand the infrastructure of what was built and no idea how to use the tools that they have taken control over.

Wed Jun 12 2013, IT Department,,Current Employee ,"Once an company where you felt like a member of the family, now one where you are ""just an employee""!",3,"Benefits are competitive. Company growing in size due to constant acquisitions of other competing companies. Schedule is 8-5 for the most part.
","Since the acquisition of Southern Union, things have changed for the worse. Company has abandoned ALL core values and have inherited the processes and practices of the acquired company. Company has become a them vs us environment and management has no reasonable plan(s) to fix the issues at hand. 

When i first started with Energy Transfer, it felt more like a family that a job. The acquisition and changes in IT management has made it feel more like you are just working until they are ready to release you from your position, which now apparently can happen for no reason whatsoever.

Steer clear of this company and what it now claims to offer. New IT management have mastered the art of deception and will lie to your face before turning the table on you.

","- bought out by Energy Transfer Partners and the company has gone through job eliminations especially on the support roles (finance, HR, etc)
- due to the buyout, Sunoco Logistics eliminated some of their modern benefits such as recognizing domestic/same-sex partners as part of the employees eligibility. 
- again, due to the buyout, ETP has had a lot of influence on how things are run and how things are communicated. With ETP being a public company, I was shocked to see a holiday email from the ETP CEO to all employees including SXL where the CEO explicitly referenced the holiday as ""CHRISTmas"" several times in that exact format with a high level of religious tones throughout. 
- a lot of political red tape. People are more concerned about ones job title rather than their actual names. A lot of the more tenured employees there are almost mind-warped to where they are told what to do, and they do it without questioning.
Advice to Management
Less about religion and more about equality. This also includes same sex benefits. If you plan on staying relevant in 2013 and beyond, your policies, management style and overall branding of your company towards your current employees and potential candidates need to reflect that of today and not move backwards.
