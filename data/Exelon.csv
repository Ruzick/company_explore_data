","Management needs a serious facelift. It seems like there is one goal and it’s to meet the budget so they can reap the financial rewards. Lots of leadership roles step on each other’s feet. The organization stresses diversity, inclusion and equity but reward the biggest offenders with promotions, awards, and raises. If you want to succeed here, best be prepared to learn who the rule makers are (it’s not always who you think), plant your nose firmly up their rear, and become the quintessential yes person. Anyone truly committed to their role and the greater good will not succeed based on merit alone. It’s a pity but it is how it is.
Advice to Management
When employees reach out with serious concerns and warnings that things need to improve, pay heed. They know more than you (suck it up and accept this as fact. It doesn’t make you any less of a leader if you know how to leverage the intel). Otherwise, you’ll see a continued exodus of your best talent. Treat your reports right and they might stick with you longer.

","Everything that comes out of HR and the executive level is pushing the black agenda. There’s a hierarchy of black execs that are in the “African American” leadership council and they have an unlimited budget for splurging on expensive dinners and travel. If you’re one of the chosen blacks in their liking, you’re on the fast track for advancement. But beware and
DON’T ever cross them, it won’t go well for you. I’ve seen people let go for “poor performance”, that’s their way of firing people that go against their agenda.

Pay: Much better being a contract employee. Lost significant amount of pay after joining as a full-time employee. No perks or competitive benefits package could make up for the loss in compensation.
Benefits: Sub-par. Only one option for medical.
Work/Life Balance: Probably the worst part of the job. Evening, weekends, holidays are often disrupted because employees must perform ""storm duties"".
When major storms hit, employees are expected to travel through dangerous storm conditions to work on-site from Bethesda storm center and work 12 hour shifts.

Thu Jan 23 2020, Senior Business Analyst,"Washington, DC",Former Employee ,"Lost between past, present, and future",7,"When it shines, it shines brighter than any public utility in the country. Exelon does a ton right. There is tremendous opportunity to learn about all sectors in the electric utility space, and I mean any part. Exelon is involved from start to finish in the life-cycle of electricity, from production to distribution, to innovation they have it all. Easily a company one could spend an entire career at. Great work-life balance, decent benefits.
","Unfortunately with all the good the company does right, it does just as much, if not more wrong for the employees. Exelon touts their benefits and pay compensation like sites like Glassdoor and LinkedIn don't exist. These are middle of the road at best if not subpar at this point. The biggest problem is career stagnation and outright mismanagement. There are a ton of directors walking around at Exelon that simply don't belong in that role. Nepotism is real, even if senior management denies it. The company also suffers from a ton of roadblocks at middle management positions forcing young talent to look elsewhere for career advancement.
Advice to Management
Revamp performance reviews and be honest yourselves. The company has a bright future, smart executive leaders, but a dense fog at the director to upper manager levels that is preventing the best and brightest from rising to the occasion.

Tue Jan 28 2020, IT Analyst,,Former Employee ,New leadership train wrecked a good company,5,"Pay matches the market, good bonus structure and work from home flexibility.
","First 4 yrs were ok, the last year plus went down hill. It was a good company to work for until the new VP came in. Since then, morale sucks. Employees are continually complaining about unfair treatment across multiple departments. Groups that did not operate 24/7 were held to 24/7 SLAs then questioned why they didn't met the SLA, seriously. Then automation was forced on teams with no coding skill only to take 6 months to develop a team to help. Matrix are now the one stop shop for all judgment, which can be fine, but the reports are broke so groups have gotten beat up over and over for false reports. 

On call is horrible, not tiered properly and vastly different between departments.

You WILL put in a LOT of hours. Work life balance is talked about, but it’s WAY out of balance for most. If you think a 60 hr work week is balance, then you know what Exelon means by work balance. On the other side of the coin, there are people that don't do a thing and somehow manange to fly under the radar. 

The company flip flops on hiring contractors then follows up with talk about subbing out work continuously. It’s as if they don't know what they want and someone new comes in and thinks they can save a buck. In the end, it’s a yo-yo approach that only stresses employees. 

Managers are told of the dissatisfaction, but it seems they are limited in power. From the bottom looking up, others around the new management are just yes people while the lower lv is not recognized like years past.

Fri Aug 09 2019, Financial Analyst,"Oak Brook, IL",Current Employee ,As Advertised,2,"Exelon markets itself as a leader in the future of energy. In fact, they are. The bulk of their energy portfolio is nuclear which is a zero emission fuel source which will be vital as we (hopefully) move away from fossil fuels. Additionally, they sell potential staff on competitive benefits, growth opportunity, and diversity. Generally, these are catch-all phrases that sound great on paper but are never put into action. Exelon legitimately does have above-market pay and benefits. Base comp, retirement, etc. are all above market and they also leverage their size to get some really cool fringe benefits as well! Further, there is ample opportunity for growth within your department and company-wide. They offer analytics, learning modules, tuition assistance, and plenty of inter-departmental groups. Lastly, diversity is key here. Exelon aims to mimic the communities they are located within so you truly do get a wide range of backgrounds, races, ethnicity, and just overall personalities here. It makes our company great.

Fri Aug 16 2019, Engineer,"Prince Frederick, MD",Former Employee ,Unprofessional,5,"Good pay. I definitely felt challenged with the work I was doing. My direct supervisors were lenient and trusted me to get my work done.
","I was a staff aug contractor (engineering) at a nuclear power plant. Exelon began to change rules for staff aug contractors almost every month. This was sometime in the year 2015. They implemented a rule that contractors had to take 90 days off for every 2 year period. When I tried to come back after my 90 day period, I found that I was on a ""do not hire list"". The people I worked with and managers tried to understand why I was put on this list. Apparently, it was from the security department in corporate office. No one could get an answer. A few times I called the security department, but they never could answer the question about why I was on this list. Some did not even bother to call me back. I understand companies have a ""do not hire"" list, but it was uncalled for in my situation since I was one of their top employees and did nothing wrong. They did not even have the decency to help me understand why. I actually suspect it was done illegally.
On two separate occasions after 2016 someone from Exelon called me to work as a staff aug at their nuclear power plant since I have a good reputation in the industry. The same thing resurfaced. The managers that wanted to hire me also did not get a valid reason.

","The staff has been severely cut, through retirements and normal attrition, in an effort to reduce overhead. But no work has been cut. Engineers are stretched very thin and often work long hours. What makes the situation worse is the lack of knowledge retention. We have lost a lot of very smart folks with 30 plus years of experience to retirement but there is very little effort to transfer their knowledge and experience to new engineers. This means even when we hire new engineers they are essentially useless. All this creates an environment that sees an almost unheard of turnover rate. Since I have been at this specific job (5ish years), about 2 dozen engineers have quit systems and design engineering or taken jobs elsewhere in the company. 

Lastly, while there are great career progression opportunities, they come with a significant increase in hours. Most of the lowest level supervisors put 60 hours in on a regular, non event work week. Work to reduce that have not been fruitful.

When new policies are dreamed up, also enact a workable change management plan. If you reduce workers, you have to reduce work otherwise it doesnt make a difference.

Develop your employees and don't tell them they are doing a great job and then one second later try and push them out the door. Exelon use to be a great company to work for but really lacking inspirational leadership. All leadership cares about is hitting their big bonus at year end.

","I have been with Exelon as a member of management for several years and am extremely frustrated. I have interviewed for several positions out there only to be disappointed time after time. In almost every instance I have been the most qualified, educated, or experienced candidate but was not selected. I am a solid employee that is dedicated, loyal, and respected by my peers. So, why do I keep getting passed over? It's primarily because of nepotism or the good old boy system that gets me every time or the excuse that they ""had"" to find a job for an employee. In the two times that has happened to me, the person beating me out had a parent working for Exelon....Hmmm....shocker. Compensation is based on who you know and not experience or past accomplishments. My advice is that you shouldn't expect anything based on hard work because it doesn't matter. What matters is if your mommy or daddy or buddy works there. If so, definitely apply to Exelon.
Advice to Management
Seriously reevaluate all HR hiring and compensation practices. It's extremely common for people to get passed over due to nepotism or the buddy system. Compensation and pay level promotions are waived for some but not for all.

Sat Aug 18 2018, IT Project Manager,"Warrenville, IL",Current Employee ,"Good Benefits, however it's key to get a job at the right grade level because promotions are hard to come by",5,"1. Good Benefits with Pension Plan, 15 days vacation, 4 Personal Days, 5 sick days, Stock Options, Company Bonus where lowest Grade Level (E02) receives 10%; However HMO health insurance seems pricey at about $450/mo for parent and child
2. Lots of projects for Project Managers. Many are interesting, challenging and innovative.
3. Able to work from home 3 days a week on some Nuclear teams.
4. The employees, for the most part, are friendly and great to work with across IT and Nuclear
","1. If you don't enter the company at the correct Grade Level, there is no opportunity for a promotion on the same team or Division, unless someone leaves a position at the next Grade Level. You have to apply for a promotion when a position of interest at the next Grade Level opens anywhere in the company. I have received many accolades and recognitions for my work, but cannot be given a promotion. Most positions at the next grade level for project management require travel which is not an option for me. Also, there is little turnover in the company overall, so positions at the next level take a while to open up.
2. No Program Manager or Portfolio Manager positions
3. No PMO; Although a new group is starting that will provide guidance on Project reporting via HP PPM, and best practices. It will not include resource load planning for projects across IT.
4. The IT Project Management effort is underestimated and understaffed causing Project Managers to work 50 - 65 hours a week in Nuclear Division. Project Coordinators are needed to support Project Managers but these positions do not exist.
5. Resource load planning for projects at the IT level is not performed. Too many priority projects across several IT departments are implemented at the same time requiring the same resources, which cause those resources to work over 50 hours a week.
Advice to Management
I recommend IT management take into account resource loads as priority projects are scheduled. The schedule should take into account the resources in all IT Departments that are required to work on the projects, so that resources are not overloaded and additional resources can be secured prior to the projects starting. Many employees are getting burn out because IT Management is not doing this.

","If you did not work for Mayor Daily or Emanual's office or another governmental department in Chicago, you will find it hard to climb past basic management. This is extremely political, not what you know but who you know or who you worked for in the past. They work on projects that politicians want and not what consumers want.
Very few leaders were qualified for their positions (not bashing them personally, just professionally.. they were pretty nice people in general.) Our boss used to leave a digital tape recorder on top of her purse so she could record the discussions in the adjacent cubicles. (Yes I have photos). She was not qualified for her role, and knew the rest of the team outshined her. The projects are fine to work on, and the deliverable's are weak, as we only needed to justify our existence. There is no consumer or governmental pressure to actually reduce costs and no competitive forces for reducing the pricing. There is a lot of cost justification, and little to no discussion about cost savings or providing pricing benefits to the consumer.

Wed Jan 31 2018,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Garbage company and getting worse...,1,"The people you work with are mostly pretty good. You have many managers that shouldn't be managers but no one else will take the job because it's horrible pay for huge responsibility.
","The amount of cons is far too long to list. They will give goals to hit and if you go above and beyond they won't give you a bonus that matches what you earned. This year they just took away over 50% of ComEds yearly bonus just because the Exelon board could, no actual reason was given. ComEd, not sure of other companies under Exelon, is known in the electrical industry for using and abusing their employees. One thing that should be under the pro is if you work for them a couple years anyone in the industry will hire you because they know you'll think their company is like heaven. Exelon HR is purely corporate oriented they couldn't care less how employees are treated. Health insurance keeps skyrocketing every year. Now new hires don't even get supplemental insurance when they retire and no pension anymore. If you're young and talented DO NOT waste your career with Exelon/ComEd. There are so many power companies that treat their employees far better. I know because I have many friends throughout the industry. Unfortunately I'm stuck with them until children graduate high school. This is a company that is going downhill. They will not pay you what you deserve and they never stop taking away what you've earned. Every year they chip away and give you less and less but want you to work more and harder. You have Sr VPs who are control freaks and who are nuts. You have people in positions like directors and high level managers that are only in the job because no one else wants the jobs so they constantly promote their least talented. The talented employees are too smart to take on higher level jobs with greater responsibility for almost no benefit in pay or any other aspect. Every position except if you're in the union is under paid and over worked. If you need a job it pays the bills, if you're starting your career only work for them if it's your only option.

In December 2016, we took the national Equal Pay Pledge to publicly declare a commitment to equal pay. We were pleased that the results of an independent third-party analysis of Exelon's pay practices showed no systemic pay differences between men and women in comparable jobs with similar levels of experience. Enhancing employee development is another critical focus area for our HR and Leadership teams. The recent transformation of our performance management process equips employees with more modern and simplified tools, processes, and technologies that are specifically designed to foster professional development and build an inclusive culture through real-time dialogue.

","For a company so large, it is remarkable how favoritism is so prevelant at the executive level.

I can honestly say I love my job, and our workgroup all the way from our VP down thru the Directors, Managers, Supervisor and our workgroup

If you want a career where you are appreciated, valued and want to make a difference... Exelon is the place for you. My only regret is that I didn't' jump from my former employer and go to Exelon sooner!

The workplace is great, fun people encouraging work life balance. Leadership not only listens to employees they actively solicited input, support creativity, nurture innovation, career development and advancement. Employees are easy to work with and very talented. Teamwork and collaboration drive our success. Everyone is passionate, down to earth

Exelon is community focused, encourages and actively enables employees to give back to our communities and puts its money where it mouth is. As employees volunteer time and money Exelon gives additional bonuses to that company. 

Finally, the on-boarding is very comprehensive and implemented well! Everything from HR thru your new job duties, goals, roles, responsibilities, procedures, and work flow are documented, easy to follow and easy to find. Exelon has an awesome company and employee portal!
","(While this may be a con for the employee... it is a big pro for our customers)
Expect occasional long hours and an emergency response role. Work load and hours can be very demanding at times but there are opportunities for work life balance. 

We often have meetings and work thru lunch, however our management team appreciates our hard work and extra efforts by providing great meals

I work in downtown Philadelphia. And I dreaded considering a long commute into the city. It was the primary reason I didn't consider an Exelon career sooner. Now that I have been working here for just under a year. I have come to appreciate the flexibility our management team provides. They offer state of the are video conferencing tools and are very understanding and supportive with flexible schedules and reporting locations. 

I can honestly say the pros far out weigh the cons!

","I don't even know where to begin. HR is full of snakes and they try to hire you for as little as possible while they pay the CEO over $100 million a year. They talk about cost containment and then send out company memos talking about how profits have gone up and how many millions they have saved. They saved that money on the backs of their employees, the ones who are down in the real world doing the work. You are expected to give up your life in order to meet deadlines.

Wed Oct 19 2016, Electrical Engineer,,Current Employee ,Electrical Systems Engineer,4,"After moving on from entry level engineering position, the pay is very very competitive. There is also a large opportunity to learn beyond your specific engineering focus which is great for a career. For example, even if you're electrical, you might be expected to learn mechanical systems which is great for development. There is also a lot of opportunities for growth if you put a lot of work in and make your goals clear.
","While the pay can be good, the leadership in the company seems to struggle with decision making.
Specific site leadership is the same, and is constantly using general company ""propaganda"" terms and goals and then making decisions that contradict those. 
Engineers are also used as an ""unlimited resource"" due to no work hour rules and salary pay. Which means they will put as much work on you as they can, and expect long work hours.

","It's a large company so the curve to get ramped up is quite large and security adds to that given the process to get into any system.Overall I'd sum it up in saying trying to steer a ship this large is a gradual change not something you can expect to move in a few weeks.
Advice to Management
With your charitable giving consider also adding charity time off, not just for energy in the community events. I volunteer significantly outside of our events and I'd love to be able to not have to take PTO to do that.

","Where to start? We're also so demoralized that some departments are having interviews to see how they can get people to stay. You can't fill out a survey there because nothing is anonymous so they will track you down if you say anything negative. It's a men's club. If you hang out with the right people, you get a promotion. If you are a woman or a man who prefers going home instead of drinking with the boys, you pay the price. They spend tons of money on things that don't matter, such as entertaining lavishly but plead cost optimization when you ask for more money to do your job. No one volunteers for anything, because you're not rewarded. Then they try to have team building exercises and wonder why no one is interested in participating. We're all leaving because unless you're a man who already has drinking buddies there, you have nothing coming.

Not good for your health, mentally or physically. They have health challenges, but then they turn around and have cookoffs and wing eating challenges. 

They are all about talent acquisition instead of talent retention. When you join, they make sure to lowball you and no one is allowed to know their salary range, so of course, you get the short end of the stick.

","Majority of the team I was assigned to was fairly new. Whenever they would make mistakes they would blame it on the interns. Throughout the entire program I constantly asked for feedback on tasks in which I was assigned. In result i was ALWAYS told by team members ""everything is great"" and ""you're doing a good job"" only to find out team members were bashing me to my manager. She never came to me for verification of these accusations either. When I went to her I was accused of being defensive. She (my manager) never showed any interest in me, or my career goals she didn't even ask what they were. Nor did she ever interact with me if she didn't have to. Common hallway interactions she would avoid eye contact at all cost and go out of her way to avoid a conversation with me. My third day with the company she asked me ""how I managed to land this position"". She also made inappropriate remarks to me quite often which lead me to develop anxiety while at work. Everything I learned about the company I learned from people I met at Intern networking events. My team would invite me to meetings, I would attend and my manager would tell me that I don't need to be there. Why invite me only to kick me out how do you expect me to learn anything. This was a terrible experience.

Work life balance is difficult. You were required to work overtime without getting paid.

Managers are out of reach and do not know what the daily operations are, only showing up in office once every two weeks. 

Technology used is very old and out of dated. 

Benefits are not great for new employees.

The company asks employees to donate a lot of money to local charity every year, which is supposed to be a good thing. But the company does not match employees' donation, and the percentage of each department's donation becomes a KPI for managers, so every employee got pressure from managers to donate no matter what.

I have been working at Exelon full-time for less than a year
Pros
Work Environment with team is great, some sharing knowledge, experience and shadowing is provided. Allowing new employees time to learn the specific business is also good.
Cons
Access to systems is extremely slow which impedes ability to gain knowledge thru training and reviewing material.
Advice to Management
For Constellation, continue with the current process, expedite access to systems for new employees, develop a New Employee manual that is relevant to the position

Wed Apr 13 2016,N/A,"Philadelphia, PA","Electrical Engineer in Philadelphia, PA",Workplace discrimination against Asians/Indians,11,"Great benefits package and off-site cooperate training opportunities
","Communication from management is minimal at best, the delegation and follow-through of projects lack focus and organization. Complaints and obvious problems are ignored creating low morale and the loss of good employees to other groups or new companies. The company comes up short with minority employee numbers, while the mass majority remains of the Caucasian race. As an Asian/Indian the discrimination has been shown through being passed over for promotions and positions to less experienced and educated colleagues... It is an obvious perception at my workplace that the Indian in the room is really smart, is a very hard worker - BUT, is probably a better sort of technical or behind-the-scenes thinker and not leader. When approaching management of these issues, the fact that I have an accent is given as their reasoning...because, obviously having an accent would effect my social skills or elevated technical skills developed through past experience and a Masters Degree earned at a highly esteemed American University!?!?!?
Advice to Management
Manage your groups, don't just loosely delegate projects. Follow through on employee reviews, and promote achievements. Don't hide behind the four walls and closed door surrounding your office.

The company cares so much about diversity, that it doesn't always promote based on merit in my view.

The culture is one of title and hierarchy meaning more than competence, ability and work ethic.
Advice to Management
Stop being so politically correct. Figure out a strategy or you will be acquired and will be unemployed. You should probably gut a lot of your top and mid to high end managers (SVP, VP, Director level jobs) and you might actually be able to make money on the deregulated side of the business.

","Design engineering at the nuclear plants has nothing to do with classical design. All our design was completed by Sargent & Lundy in the 70's and 80's. We're just maintaining everything. In your interview they'll tell you about all this great stuff you'll be doing, but you'll soon realize that the challenging, fast-paced work environment you desire does not exist at Exelon. Vast majority of work is slow-paced administrative work. Information takes forever to obtain because of the lack of technology. Drawings haven't been updated since the 70's, very little on CAD, no BIM models for power plants, everything is on paper floating somewhere among the countless unorganized shelves, filing cabinets and senior engineer's desks. Management is not receptive of new ideas from the younger generation although they encourage ""out-of-the-box"" thinking. Nuke plants are dominated by former Navy who bring their military ""yes man"" demeanor to Exelon management. They are also not very receptive or comfortable with working with women. Middle managers are worthless babysitters and upper management rarely disagrees with the guy above them. Exelon and its subsidiaries are regulated utility companies. There's little incentive to change anything or improve workplace efficiency because of the ICC energy auctions and company budgeting. Have extra money at the end of the year? Why bother updating our out-dated training programs or data management when we can build another conference room with expensive projectors that never get used. Unless you work at corporate in Chicago or Naperville, then you'll probably work in the middle-of-nowhere. No overtime pay. Outages require 6, 10 hour days and no weekends off. Cannot drink or travel one week of each month when you're ""on duty"" and might be called in.
Advice to Management
Allow change! Stop saying you want new ideas when you provide no outlet for engineers to express and address them. Stop labeling positions as ""Design"" when only maintenance is being done. Out-source work to get physical files transferred to computer-searchable data. Job feels working for a government jobs program.

The company is a proud company with a history of leading the industry. Saying that, pride is considered one of the seven deadly sins for a reason. Over time, too much pride in past accomplishments can lead to a reluctance to look externally at what others are doing (better). Eventually, performance will plateau and then decline if the only source of ideas are those generated internally. Look for innovation both inside and outside the company.

","Exelon is a company in complete conflict. On one hand, they tout themselves as diverse, inclusive and 'zero tolerance' for inappropriate behavior. In reality, culture is dominated by white males who are highly exclusive due to the highly political culture and inappropriate behavior is tolerated because Senior Management turns a blind eye to it when it's not politically advantageous for them to act. 
Previous post Director in Chicago office was spot on. We have quality leaders who are leaving or looking to leave because they are not politically connected and are not males.

Sat Aug 08 2015,N/A,"Chicago, IL"," in Chicago, IL","Very low pay and it's all about statistics, not people",2,"Great benefits if you actually make enough money to use them
","The benefits offered are great but you can't afford to use them because your salary doesn't cover anything but bills (if that). HR doesn't care about people, only making sure they look good on sites like this one. You can make a lot less with an MBA or another advanced degree than someone who only has a high school degree. Not enough money to invest in savings, retirement, or any of their other plans. HR will lowball you as much as possible. You need an inside track or a friend who is in management to make a decent salary. The company has no problem spending money when they feel it is relevant, but are quick to plead poverty otherwise. They put up videos on YouTube for recruiting purposes but don't believe a word. It's all about statistics, not about investing in people.

Thu Jul 09 2015,Anonymous,"Baltimore, MD",Current Employee ,Minority Senior Engineer (over 10 years with BGE/20+ years in Engrg),2,"The utility industry as a whole is a very stable work environment, BGE will be celebrating 200 years in 2016. As for the work culture here, I can say there are pockets of exceptional leaders (most of whom are retiring) and pockets of those individuals that should not be leaders and are extremely toxic. Our HR department is well aware of these individuals and for whatever reason do nothing to correct the issues. It is sad really, as I have watched very seasoned and talented individuals leave this company due to these toxic individuals. My advice to anyone looking at this company for employment is to do your research and ask someone within the organization where to work and who to work for....avoid the drama and possibility of having to look for another job (internally or externally).
","As for diversity and inclusion...it is merely a façade that Exelon ""owns"" and mandates down to the business entities (nice try but this is not working). I am a seasoned female engineer and can say with great disappointment, that we are not even close to operating in the 21st Century (there are only 16 female engineers @ BGE at the Individual Contributor Level- this is 0.4% of the BGE employee base....wow, really?). As mentioned above, there are pockets of toxic leaders in this company that do not recognize work-life balance nor the needs of single/widowed parents...if these leaders could realize that having young children is such a blessing and truly a short period in ones life, they could retain and grow very valuable company assets. I have heard of disheartening stories within this company that young mothers have been forced to leave the company because their leaders did not allow flexible working hours for childcare and/or health issues....truly disappointing and understanding why FMLA exists. 

Other issues exist with the ""less seasoned"" generation's attitude of ""entitlement"" and beliefs that they should be senior employees/leaders after only <5 years of service/work experience...BGE is bypassing and losing valuable employees/leaders because they pacify this generation's mentality and promote these people to incompetence.
Advice to Management
Open your eyes and start ""walking the talk"". You conduct employee surveys and do not correct the issues nor do you take a deep enough dive into what the issues truly are (the survey is too vague). Read the posts on this site...they speak loudly to work-life issues, how employees are treated, etc.....If you do not start to truly lead with integrity, then this company will suffer as others have historically done, like General Motors...Exelon has Union employees at PECO & COMED for a reason....do you really want that to happen to BGE?

","The Company leaders are so far removed from employees, you get the sense that they really could care less about employee satisfaction, work life balance, etc. There is so much amazing talent, that the leaders are unaffected when people leave, and in fact the company culture is such that, many people feel like they are getting pushed out, regardless of their excellent performance reviews.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees, empower them to speak up, back them and invest in them. You may see a change in turnover if you do these things. However, it is likely that you like to see employees leave and so if that is the case, dont need to change a thing.

","Office politics are very big here and your career advancement is dependent on you getting into the right circle. Your opportunities for promotion as well as your annual bonus is very dependent on you kissing up and knowing the right people.

The work I do really matters! My leadership team (manager, director, VP, and SVP) ensures that my dept has the right people, in the right roles, and at the right time to deliver results. I work in a dept where team work is 'off the charts.' I truely enjoy the challenge of serving as a strategic business partner to other Exelon's depts.

My manager encourages me and allows me to use my knowledge, skills, and abilities to enhance the work assigned to me. What a great place to work!!!!
","Computer setup and system access takes too long when an employee first joins the company. The first 3 days are NOT highly productive, but after that — no problem. It seems to take approx 3 days to get your computers and system access all setup and ready. Too many calls to IT, but all issues get resolved.

Advice to Management
Though some effort is being made to address the quickly eroding workforce (through retirements), more should be done. The remaining workforce cannot perform all of the work and also train the replacements. Re-hiring retirees as contractors should be a short-term solution, not a permanent solution. Eventually, the retirees that receive traditional pensions will run out, at which point coming back as a contractor will hold little value to the retirees. Keep a strong benefits package to continue to draw the right talent.

Thu Jul 10 2014, Senior Generation Liaison,"Baltimore, MD",Current Employee ,Exelon is a great comapny that invests in its employees.,0,"Exelon offers its employees many growth opportunities. The company has a great development program. When I first accepted a management position they sent me to a 1 month development program to develop my leadership skills. I have worked in many areas of the industry including instrument and controls, operations, mechanical maintenance, and generation dispatch. The company has always been supportive of all of my goals. When I expressed that I wanted to work in our commodities trading business unit I was allowed to shadow trade floor operations. Exelon also supported my goal by funding a significant portion of my MBA. I currently work to coordinate our physical position to support the traders in all of our regions.

Exelon capitalizes on diversity. I am a perfect example. I have worked in several types of plants in many different roles. Exelon uses my diverse background to help our commodities organization to work more coherently with our generation fleet. 

Exelon works to support the communities we serve. The company is actively engaged in volunteer programs. I have personally had the opportunity to work with students at technical colleges and environmental groups though my affiliation with Exelon. 

Exelon is well balanced. We have a good mix of regulated utilities, retail power and merchant generation. This mix provides endless opportunities for employees that are willing to try new things. The company is aggressively looking to expand which brings more opportunities. 

Exelon has a great benefits package. We have a pension, 401K, employee stock purchase program, wellness programs, many types of clubs and social groups, great health benefits, and great vacation policies. 

I love working here. I have actively recruited personal friends to work for the company.
","One of the Cons at Exelon is that I work a lot. If you are looking to work a forty hour week this may not be the place for you. That being said, Exelon and my immediate supervisor have been very supportive of working remotely or at satellite location to improve my work life balance.

Another potential Con is that the company is very widespread. Sometimes to achieve your goals you may be required to relocate.

Thu Jul 10 2014, Manager,"Oak Brook, IL",Current Employee ,Change your career without changing companies,0,"Exelon has a number of subsidiary companies, each with various positions and opportunities. Want to work in Marketing for a couple of years? Go for it. Now you say you want to work with political stakeholders? No problem. Wait…..how about trying your hand at managing a Call Center? We’ve got a spot open. There are very few companies out there that allow you to move from department to department, career to career, without having to jump ship. In fact, learning new skill sets is HIGHLY encouraged. I really appreciate the fact that I can move around the company every few years and try my hand at something new and exciting.
","Rightfully so, the company's number one priority is to keep the lights on for our customers. Meaning, if there is a storm or some type of adverse event, EVERYONE is expected to pitch in and help mobilize crews to restore power. We refer to this work as ""storm duty"". Thus, if you are ""on duty"" when a storm hits, you do not work your 9-5 job and instead work to restore service. This could easily mean 12 to 16 hour days depending on the gravity of the destruction. Plus, you still have to make up all the work left undone at your 9-5.

Tue Jul 01 2014, Systems Engineer,"Braceville, IL",Current Employee ,Great Opportunities for someone looking for a place to succeed,2,"1) I really enjoy the challenges that are presented. I have been able to move around in my department and to different departments to get a better feel for the organization. 
2) Special projects outside of your day-to-day experience. If you hate doing the same thing over and over, that won't happen working at this company. I receive great opportunities for new experiences whenever possible. This has lead to great networking oppotunities in the industry and in the fleet. 
3) The benefits are much better working here. The pay is on the order of 85th percentile for recent graduates. Vacation is also very good, we get holidays plus two to four weeks standard (depending on your entry level) and rolling over unused days is also possible.
4) This company invests in you. There is always additional training offered to specialize in your job or for more general requirements such as root cause training. You can pick which training courses you want to take to be more efficient at your job along with standard courses for you and your collegues. 
5) The single best thing about working for this company is that they address feedback. This industry feeds on critical feedback and makes it a cornerstone for improvement.
","1) Work-Life balance needs to be strived for to obtain. I wouldn't expect that a 40 hour week would ever be considered normal, unless you are in the union. More often than not, expect 50 hour weeks. 
2) This is a very fast-paced environment, so things happen rapidly.
3) Depending on your job, it will be expected that if there are issues on off-hours including holidays and weekends that you are there to support if required.

-- flexible work schedules in professional roles
-- Compensation is actively benchmarked against industry, so pay is (by design) average for large corporations. But since the benchmark is against large corporations, when compared to all available job options in the area the pay is actually pretty decent in my opinion.
-- well defined policies for EVERYTHING
-- lots of room to move around the company, I have gotten to rotate to new job every 1-3 years. Or you could stay in the same job the whole time if you prefer.
-- Easy for ""high performers"" to get ahead and progress in career without changing companies
","-- Benefits actively benchmarked against industry, so benefits are (by design) average, I've seen much better benefits in gov or other private sector jobs, but our benefits are not the worst.
-- Work Life balance is tough, in order to be a ""high performer"" you are going to be working about 20% overtime
-- Change Management is non existant, you are lucky if you get an email about a change that is coming and will affect you. The company could do a much better jobs with communicating change.
Advice to Management
remove stock holder protection feature from annual bonus, while I understand the logic from a shareholder perspective it is very demoralizing to employees. This options caps the bonus payout of the child company’s based on the performance of the stock price for the parent company (exelon). The result is that employees in the child company’s feel no connection between their bonus and their actual efforts because the bonuses are often capped based on things out of the employee’s control. A child company can have a great year but wind up not getting rewarded because the stock price did not do well which could be completely driven by market forces outside of the child company's control.

Wed Jul 02 2014, Supervisor,"Baltimore, MD",Current Employee ,"A brave, new post-merger world",0,"-Career opportunities: I started working at the Baltimore utility branch of Exelon in 2001 as a customer call center representative. I have moved to a new job about every 24-36 months, always a promotion, always enriching my knowledge and skills. Now I'm a supervisor in a design and engineering area and I'm grateful for the varied opportunities available for all company employees. From special projects to volunteering to employee resource groups, there are so many ways to network and carve a path to success.
-Generous tuition reimbursement: Since my undergraduate degree is in a liberal arts field I wanted to go back to school to get a formal business education. I'm pursuing my MBA from a great school in Maryland. The tuition reimbursement level for Masters programs at Exelon is exceptionally generous compared to my classmates' companies.
-Feels like a family: I was concerned after the merger with Exelon that my utility company would lose our identity in this much larger corporation. My fears have not been founded. Every interaction I've had with the other utilities has indicated to me that they are each similarly a family, and both individuals and the corporation as a whole has been nothing but welcoming to the newest branch of the Exelon organization.
-Flexible work schedule: Flex time is a wonderful benefit that most employees enjoy, shift working organizations notwithstanding. Generous amounts of PTO and flex time combine to make it very easy to achieve a satisfactory work-life balance.
","-Change Management: The chief con that I have encountered is a lack of adequate emphasis on the importance of change management when it comes to integrating new systems or processes. The perception is that Exelon as a whole will push down new applications or changes to applications without ample notice to the business areas to allow proper change management strategies, or at times without enough time to revise processes that are impacted by the changes. If you're very agile this will bother you less, but as a utility we have a workforce that is both aging and unaccustomed to rapid change. This has been a struggle.
-Over taxed leadership: From first line supervision in ""the trenches"" to the mid level leaders there is a prevailing sense that everyone has too much on their plates. It is easy for an employee to feel that their concerns are not a priority when leaders are often unavailable due to their full schedules of meetings. As a first line leader I wish I had more time to develop employees towards their career goals, help them determine what their goals are, or assist them in forming their own teams to work on process improvements. Sadly, the time is not there.
Advice to Management
A stronger emphasis on change management and change leadership would go a long way in improving the general impression of how much Exelon cares about the employees who work here. There is a sense that the system changes that are pressed down are coming from a place that is very distant from the business areas being asked to implement them.

Tue Jul 01 2014, Senior IT Analyst,"Baltimore, MD",Current Employee ,A mix of great opportunity and frustration,3,"I started two years ago after graduating with a BS in IT. I had previously interned the summer prior and was offered a competitive starting salary as a contractor with the idea of transitioning to an employee. Within 6 months they made me an offer as an employee and it was for a Senior level position, with a pay bump. This has been great for my career and I've taken on a lot of responsibility very quickly as I am the only employee on the system I work on. I've also been approached to work on a pioneering pilot project, and had the opportunity to present the project to several VPs and the CEO of one of the utilities. I've been awarded prizes for innovative ideas as well.
","- Work life balance is off. For the past 2 years I have been the only employee on a system that processes a rather significant sum of money daily, I am responsible for 24/7 application support. I've gotten calls at 2 AM, had to stay up from 11 pm to 7 AM unexpectedly, etc. I finally have another employee joining my system who should be able to provide some relief. 

- Leadership is very apprehensive regarding new ideas and new technologies, even for low risk projects. They often opt for far more expensive solutions with the expectation that it will be easier to maintain or find contractors to work on the system, but that's not always the case. I presented an innovative solution that would have saved a considerable sum over the proposed solution, yet it was shot down. My solution was later brought back up by senior management several months later as potential solution to some other issues though. It was frustrating to see my idea shot down and recycled as someone else's later on.

- Leadership tends to rely too much on (new) contractors and don't always listen to employee concerns. A major project was delayed due to contractors having the final decision in a system design, getting it wrong, and having to redesign a significant portion. A lot of that work fell back to me. I made my concerns with the original design known, yet they continued work anyway. That project was officially ""finished"" nearly two months ago, yet there are still glaring issues in user experience that no one is terribly concerned about fixing.
Advice to Management
- Management can be disconnected from employees. My manager very rarely checks in with me, which is both good and bad. I like to manage my own time, but other times my manager may be completely unaware of what I do.

Tue Jul 01 2014, Engineer II,,Current Employee ,A PECO Engineer's Experience,4,"Compensation and benefits are competitive with other companies in the industry. Annual bonus based on company performance is a good perk. There are some older linemen and engineers left who are wealths of information. This is a fast-paced work environment, which I would not consider dull by any means. The rotation program for incoming engineers offers a good opportunity to experience different parts of the company.
","The engineering organization is understaffed and is not adequately prepared to address the challenges of operating and maintaining a 100+ year-old system. Experienced employees are retiring or leaving the company, and the younger engineers are not provided with the technical training or latitude in workload to learn the necessary skills to carry the torch forward. 

Talented engineers are pushed towards a management track, which further strips horsepower from the engineering workforce. In turn, swaths of young engineers and middle management are concerned only with career advancement, not with cultivating a culture of quality. Management needs to refocus on the caliber of engineering that built the foundation of this system and kept it running for 100 years.

Wed May 21 2014, Vice President Marketing,"Baltimore, MD",Former Employee ,VP Marketing,6,"industry is fascinating and tackle societal challenges
the pay is good
","Broken culture
high turnover
no creativity
nothing gets down
every initiative gets shut down
the same ideas come back over and over again, any enthusiastic high energy hard working newbee will take it on, and people will be watching, bad mouthing his effort, and making sure he fails...
then the new bee quickly learns to just lay low, not try to climb the ladder, because the company is not growing so there is no place in the higher ranks...
people spend their time in useless meetings, where the same ideas have been thrown back and forth in the last 5 years.
rather pathetic.
every talented person does not last long, and quit.

","PECO division was downsized greatly ~ 20 years ago, so that the few that are still employed are over-worked, especially during storms. The lines that once defined your job ""roles and responsibilities"" are easily blurred given the right ""business need"" at the time. Knowledge level of company as a whole is lacking, and expected to get worse as those with 25, 30,40+ yrs. experience either move on or retire with the majority of the younger engineers having <5 yrs. of experience.
Advice to Management
Understand that your employess are just that, the employees, and do not live and breath PECO/Exelon. Workload should be monitored and kept at a resonable level to maintain efficiency and over-exhaustion of your employees. 

Refrain from speaking to your employees as if it should be automatic that you do ""xyz"" for ""the company"", even though it may not be in your initial job scope/responsibilities. Lastly, speak to your employees with respect, and not as if they are your children. This last issue may be more localized to my personal experience, but nonetheless, should be addressed.

Wed Oct 09 2013, Associate Engineer,"Oakbrook Terrace, IL",Current Employee ,Great job security with a fortune 500 company and competitive benefits,3,"For incoming new grad engineers, Exelon has a good rotation program. New grad hires get to move to a different department each month for 6 months. At the end of the rotations, your manager will ask what your top 3 preferred departments are. They will try to place you in one of these if there are openings and managers approve.

Many engineering degree grads who are not electrical engineers do not think to apply to Exelon. However, electric power concepts are not difficult to pick up and many engineering tasks at the company can be learned on the job. They will hire people with industrial, manufacturing, civil, and mechanical engineering degrees for any engineering position out of school. I even know of someone being hired for an engineering position who had a mathematics degree.

Don't get too comfy in your first job with the company. After 2 years in your first position, management generally ""recommends"" that you move to a different department. Exelon likes its employees to get an understanding of the company's various functions.

Benefits include 401k with 5% match, employe stock purchase, BCBS PPO or BCBS High deductible HSA plan (HSA contribution of $500 per year HSA balances can be invested as well), Vision Plan, Aetna Dental plan. Bonuses for new hires are targeted for 7% of base salary depending on business unit performance, it can be higher or lower than that.
","If you work in one of Exelon's utilities like PECO or ComEd then you are subject to work what is called Storm Duty. When you are on storm duty you are basically on call. If a severe storm or outage occurs during your storm duty you are called in to perform whatever function the company sees fit to assist in the restoration of service. This could be ""wire watching"" for downed wires, making reservations for field crews at hotels, dispatching field crews, etc. When you are called for storm duty you are expected to report in to your predetermined location within 1 hour. There are different storm teams that rotate duties throughout the year.

I've found its difficult to navigate through the highly political culture of this company. Exelon values diversity and we are continually reminded of that by seeing who are put in leadership positions and the barrage of ""network"" groups this company has. Very poor at sizing up talent (especially on the ComEd side) and very top heavy. I've never seen so many VPs, Directors, and Key Managers (group level employee). Some of the upper management don't even have degrees. Some of the regularly promoted don't possess the experience or have been rotated through the various operations. Yet they are put in protected positions where they will not fail. Some don't cut it but end up with titles of ""Manager-Developmental"" to keep their pay and levels. The performance management process, individual development planning, and succession planning is a joke. I and many others feel that this company has abused the employees. Abused because we consistently meet all our goals and solidly contribute to the ""performance indicators"" we are held to so highly, yet I am rewarded with a 2.5% raise, far below the 4% increase the Union membership is given in their contract. (Yes, I realize many employers have cut back raises but not here this company makes money). What a slap in the face for someone with almost 30 yrs experience, an advanced degree, who works hard and often ""takes one for the team"", and most importantly produces results. Why should I stay motivated, dedicated and give any extra? I guess to keep my raise above 2%.

They can boast several features in magazines, websites, and other noteworthy sources and proudly hold titles such as ""One of the best Companies with which to begin an IT Career."" Exelon's also a very diverse company, sporting copious talent from all walks of life and ensuring everyone has a chance to advance and move to big things. Additionally (and this is kind of an inside tip), fresh off of all their business deals and the merger between ComEd and PECO, Exelon is looking to bounce back from the hiring freeze caused by all that activity so they're not being TOO stringent on who they hire. They're also very employee satisfaction oriented...searching for new ideas and ways to make the lives of their current employees better as well as keeping an ear out for what attracts young new talent coming out of college. Plus, working with Exelon comes with many benefits: special types of bank accounts, discounts on some common and somewhat necessary goods and services, and more. As I've said, they treat their employees very well, and the pay is not bad at all either.
","From an the standpoint of an IT employee...there's room for advancement and promotion within the company...lots of it, but Exelon's IT deployment is more utilitarian than anything. Not a lot of cutting edge, innovative stuff going on there, much of your work will go toward maintaining the current software and infrastructure or finding a new means to an end.

Not much to say here:
The changing economy makes some long term focus changes within upper management trickle down upon middle management a little uneasily.

This company is a little top heavy (a few too many Directors, VPs, Senior VPs, etc...)

We are expected to perform at a higher level of excellence everyday, eventhough the workforce is slowly being down sized. This presents a challenge, but is in no way un-manageable. I personally like it this way, as it caters to my slight superman complex, but many can be turned off by this. I welcome the challenge to change the way I do business to make each task easier, thus leaving myself in charge of making my job easier.

This is a fantastic company to work for. Our future looks very bright (I may need to wear sunglasses in the office...lol).

I believe this combination of changes will work well together and increase our margin by around 2-3% immediately as well as set us up for very large gains upon the rebound of the US economy.

","This company is perfect for the employee that wants to be a 'corporate slave', or that wants to be glued to their blackberry on vacations, weekends, nights, during your commute.... There is a lot of discussion regarding WLB (Work Life Balance), and it is promised during the interview process. What is not mentioned is that if you actually do request a WLB, it is both highly frowned upon -although no one will tell you this, they will just talk about you behind your back, and expected that you will still be working your full day-although you're not in the office. 

10+ hour days are expected regardless of department or job, everything from craft employees up to Sr. Mgmt and everyone in between. 

Another problem is the finger pointing and lack of ownership. As a power company, everything is very highly monitored, regulated, and tracked (which is wonderful!). The problem comes in when employees do not stand up for their own actions or lack of action, errors, or whatever the problem may be. There are many people that are so overloaded that they push their work load onto others, which just causes work-stress, and even worse results. Middle management does not recognize work load allocation, problems within their own team, or if they do, a blind eye is turned. 

If I had to summarize, Exelon pays fairly, has good benefits, and believes in employee and community safety. My position afforded me the opportunity to talk with all different departments and levels within the organization. When I asked the question ""How do you like working for Exelon,"" the answer was always the same....""They pay is good, but money isn't everything if you can't enjoy it and you're always here. Middle and upper management needs to realize the work loads of my/our/the team and play fair.""
