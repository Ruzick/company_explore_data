Coworkers: I still hang out with some regularly, and remain in contact with others on social media even though I haven't worked there since 2013/14.

The work was interesting, and catered to my work style. Every day was different unless we were in prototype hell. Even then we were usually working on something amazing that made my inner/outer nerd very happy.

Advice to Management
The personal development section of our quarterly evaluations changed my life. The encouragement and accountability, even though not monetized, led to the publishing of my first two novels. I left during a downturn to save job cuts for those that needed them, as Amazon was paying me quite well at that time. It enabled me to be active in my daughters' lives in a way I hadn't been able to in a while.

I still encourage employers to add a personal component to evaluations for this reason, and always recommend Micron as a good company to grow with, and if possible, out of.

I know it doesn't happen often, but my site manager let me back in for a potluck after my separation (had to have a babysitter). I also came back to bring pizza for the crew to celebrate my 3rd book launch. Little touches like that make the perception that a company can't care if they're too big fly right out the window.

Very little trust and not a ton of integrity, though I think that has more to do with how big the corporation is rather than direct intent from employees or management. Peoples intentions are good, but their desire to protect their position or career in such a big corporation seem to drive them (and me) to do some strange things.

- Relatively easy work
","The department I'm in is extremely dysfunctional. The service manager I interviewed with resigned on my first day, and his replacement quit about two months after he was hired due to burnout. The company seems to punish anybody who will step into a leadership role with an incredibly unhealthy work-life balance, which disincentivises anybody else from taking on more responsilbility. 

The company culture is INCREDIBLY corporate/soulless. Even for a Fortune 500 company it's bad.

In September, the executive staff decided they wanted to start bringing everybody back into the offices in America, even though there was a global pandemic underway and we were bound to end up having to re-close after putting hundreds of people at risk for COVID. For obvious reasons, the endeavor never went through. That being said, I was basically presented with the choice of either sucking it up and returning to the office with hundreds of other people in it, or being forced to quit/be fired, which meant I would have had to repay my relocation package, and forfeit any unemployment assistance in a very uncertain job market.

Even if you are in middle-management you better hope and pray that you get into a popular group; the culture is worse than high-school.

HR is a joke!

There are two types of employees at Micron:

Worked more than 10+ years and pigeon holed into one department. Great at what they do, but they have been beaten into submission through poor management. They are constantly in fear of losing their job, they don't submit new ideas and they keep under the radar.

Worked for Micron less than 10 years, they have a slight glimmer in their eyes of hope for a future with the company. They have been passed up for promotion every year for at least five years and management only sees them when they do something perceived as wrong.
Advice to Management
The newcomers are the future of your company, listen to them, and take note of when they say there is a problem. I guarantee that if you performed an anonymous survey of all your employees with less than five years, they would say they have been treated poorly.

When someone approaches HR and they say they are being harassed by another employee--TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION! Move the employee to another shift/building/location and then perform your investigation. Do not wait a day, week or month to investigate their claim/s. Do NOT tell that person they brought on themselves. Ever. Their is no justification for harassment of any kind.

If you expect your company to make it into the future, you need to start treating you current newcomers like they are people. Maybe I am not getting through to you? Maybe this will help you understand;

Your new employees are a FOUP of blank wafers, just starting the process, and they have 150+ steps to their retirement. When you randomly test some of those wafers going through the process and you see defects; do you blame the wafers for their defects? No, you source the cause of the issue and find the tool responsible. That tool could have been on the fab floor for 20+years and now it is breaking wafers. I know you would not let a piece of equipment run that continues to break wafers...so why would you let an employee treat their fellow employees in a damaging manner?

In the past few years the executive team has put a greater emphasis on building a stronger company culture with a focus on employee satisfaction. The company has great benefits and strives to reward employees (cash/stock bonuses and discounted stock offerings). Starting compensation is average but promotions/pay increases are lackluster, especially considering strong market performance and record profits in the past few years. I can see the company making significant improvements in 2-5 years.
","The company is moving in the right direction, but progress has been slow and disjointed. There is resistance to change within the company, especially from employees who have worked here for their entire 20+ year career. Some departments are understaffed due to high attrition rates, leaving little bandwidth for high impact projects or personal development. In addition, training is either dated or non-existent so be prepared to leverage outside resources on your own time if you want to develop as an engineer. Career advancement is limited for the aforementioned reasons. Management is aware of the challenges in these areas but prefers to maintain the status quo. They claim significant progress has been made but employees will make lateral career moves within or outside the company to escape dead end departments.

","1) Complete cultural change since Sanjay took over the company. Making employees compete against each other for their jobs with the current review system. Each year the review systems forces employees within each group into a bell curve. The employees at the bottom of the bell curve are eliminated.

2) Laying off people while they are hiring at the same time.

3) Corporate leaders spewing lies about ""work life balance"" but people always working late and on the weekend to meet their goals.

4) HR group is worthless; I would never go to HR with a problem. Right now employees have no protection from a bad boss at Micron. HR is a bunch of yes men and simply go along with what the managers says.
Advice to Management
Stop lying to employees. ""Collaboration"" is a corporate value, yet the new review system makes employees compete against each other for their jobs. And the number one value is ""People, we care about each other"", yet Sanjay lays off 5% of the workforce, mostly the major contributors and experienced engineers, such as principle engineers and senior fellows.

Overhaul the HR group so they actually serve a purpose, and provide some protection for the employee.

There are a few good engineering managers at Micron, but most are just promoted engineers with no management skills; They make terrible managers and walk around like they are better than everyone else. Micron should implement the ""manager who serves"" philosophy.

","Shifting priorities seemingly overnight. Split (by design) departments must cohabitate, but each is held to significantly different standards.

I joined leadership because I thrive in this role. However, I quickly became disillusioned due to lack of authority and make decisions regarding people's performance evaluations and year rewards. Do not get me wrong, I am not power-hungry, I don't care about that. It's just that I have to go to my boss for everything to be approved.

","Workload, HR policies, work environment, lack of internal job transfers, no work life balance. 

Workload/HR Policies. I can't speak for the new grads or junior engineers but as a senior/principal level engineer the work load and job demands are unsustainable. Management will put performance requirements on you so you have to work so many hours to keep up that you have no afterwork life. Management pushes you hard by using the whip of the ""stacked ranking"" system. They say they don't have quotas but it is obvious they do. And when caught and sued they backed off a bit. But I suspect after the dust settles on the lawsuit over the ranking quotas they will go back to it with a vengeance. 

Work environment. With the ranking performance system I was beginning to see the fruits of that in that employees starting to cut corners, backstab other employees, and management playing employees against each other. This makes for a miserable existence. You are constantly looking over your shoulder and trying to give the illusion that you are happy and collaborating. 

If you're and older employee or a long time Boise employee watch out. They are working to exterminate you. Management sends a clear message that we only want young workers. The whole Diversity and Inclusion thing does not include older more experienced workers. Just a diverse new ""top tier"" new grad worker population. 

There are no careers at Micron. Just jobs. Lots of them.. if you are a young new grad. As a senior engineer there are very few opportunities for you to move around. It seems very difficult to move around because they only want to hire new grads thus shutting out seasoned and experienced senior level engineers from moving in a direction they would like their career to go. So you have to leave. 

It pains me to say these things. Micron had been good to me and my career for many many years. It was only around 2017/2018 that it took a turn for the worst. It used to feel like family but not anymore. You are just a piece of tooling that when you show the first signs of wear or break down they throw you away. Heaven forbid you get ill and can't keep up.
Advice to Management
Lose the ""stacked ranking"" performance management. This leads to a very toxic and non-inclusive work environment. It may work in a dog fighting ring or for Wall Street brokers but it should not be used in a professional engineering work environment. Management and motivation should not be through fear and intimidation but through respect and inspiration.

Wed Dec 11 2019, Revenue Accountant,"Boise, ID",Former Employee ,Pass on this job if you're truly an accountant,9,"My supervisor was amazing and worked hard to make herself available to her staff. I also really enjoyed the autonomy of just being able to do my job without being micromanaged.
","This is where it gets dicey. I wasn't at Micron for a long period of time, long enough to know that it was not what I wanted to do long term. If you're someone who needs a variety of tasks; this job isn't for you. If you're someone who wants to make a difference or has ideas about change management; this job is not for you. My job consisted of ""managing"" revenue for a sole distributor who did pretty much whatever they wanted. This distributor is larger than Micron ever will be and Micron fails to see that this distributor will not adhere to Micron's ways. Rather than finding a solution or instituting any kind of change; we were just forced to go through meeting after meeting about how horrible this distributor was. Micron is not interested in a solution to their problem; instead they're just going to go through multiple accountants who will eventually realize that this is a dumpster fire that is never going to be put out....and they leave. 

That is just the Con about the job itself; there is a whole list of cons about the company overall. People talk about the longevity of the staff here but when you actually talk to these employees they all the say the same thing; that the work sucks and the company blows but Micron pays better than everyone else so they're enslaved by their paychecks. It's a very common theme here. So is there rank and file system. I was never made aware of their ""forced ranking system"" performance management system. Had I known about it, I wouldn't have considered the offer. That's an archaic way to manage people and all it does is instill mistrust and encourages competition among teammates instead of collaboration. This has been the most depressing environment I have ever worked in, and I've worked for the IRS if that tells you anything. The finance area is a sea of narrow, high walled, gray cubicles and there is zero natural light on this floor. No one really talks to each other because we're all viewed as competition and nothing about this place encourages collaboration which fits in well with the ""every man for himself"" mentality that is prevalent here. This isn't a company....it's the Hunger Games.
Advice to Management
Don't ever start a conversation with ""I've gotten feedback""; all that tells people is that you listen to gossip. Revisit your org structure. You have senior members who are familiar with a program and have worked out all the kinks and quirks, have them turn the smoothed out distributors over to the newer members and let them focus on handling the more challenging distributors. Handing a flaming bag of garbage to a new guy and telling him to ""make the system work for you"" when he has no idea how the system works from top to bottom is just going to cost you more accountants in the long run. If you're burning through employees left and right, you need to realize there is a problem with the job itself. Throwing gasoline onto a fire isn't going to fix it.

Sat Dec 07 2019, Manufacturing Technician,"Manassas, VA",Current Employee ,Lengthy But Must Read,4,"Decent benefits, possiblity of year end bonus, gym membership. If you are hourly, you can earn a lot in overtime.
","Micron as a whole is reactionary rather than proactive which makes for frequent changes that are difficult to recover from. it preaches work life balance but the unspoken expectation is to work overtime to cover staffing issues. The company also preaches diversity and inclusion engagement in the employee resource groups but don't provide time for and punish participation ""to meet business needs."" 

The Manassas, VA location has the most toxic culture of all sites. It's a unique pressure cooker of stress that does not exist in other sites. The employees throw each other under the bus to cover their mistakes, don't recognize hard work, are two-faced, don't have accountability, and overall are miserable from being over-worked. Managemet is so far removed from the Fabrication process that the expectations and attitudes are unforgiving. Promotions are only given to yes-men rather than those qualified for the position. Perception is more important than achievements. The pattern at Fab 6 is to push more responsibilities onto existing team members rather than backfill open positions. The extra effort is rarely rewarded and regonized. Currently, Fab 6 is in the middle of an expansion which has been bungled from the start. Rather than extending the parking lot or make a garage, make shift parking was made after construction started and more people were on sight. The added parking is dangerous which is made worse by driving behaviors.

From talking to current and former employees, the overall sentimnet is they stay for the paycheck only.
Advice to Management
PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH. Fully staff the team to lessen the burden of existing employees so that they can all achieve success rather than burn out. Provide time for work life balance and to support employee resource groups. Don't hire managers just for promotion purposes but actually make sure they are ready and are qualified to be leaders. Provide supervisors time to actually advise and support the team rather than overloading them with tasks from other positions. Provide department trainers on shift for Fab employees. Training on the job is impossible with the unreasonable expectations and pressure of manufacturing. The attention is focused on running the line and making moves rather than education and fostering success. Upper management presaches that they should escalate issues but middle management hides them rather than address them. Fab 6 says that issues can be escalated through each manager until the problem is solved but instead people are punished for jumping the approval queue. Actually retain talent rather than under-paying and over-working the talent you do have.

Whether it is from ethical sourcing, recycling, community engagement, charitable giving, human rights and treatment, and any other number of topics I know Micron is committed to being the best corporate citizen it can and it truly encourages us as team members to be the same.
","We are a global company, this means long days, nights, mornings, etc... as we work to collaborate with our peers, suppliers, customers around the world. We have, over the past 2 years, have seen a genuine emphasis on improving our work-life balance (2-3 years ago I would have rated this a 1). However, the realities of being multinational will require flexibility in your work schedule. The great news is we as leaders are understanding and supportive of modified work schedules. The downside is that this will never be fully mitigated so if you are considering a career here, you should be aware that you may have days that start early, go late, or both to enable the effective collaboration of our global organization so don't be surprised by it. It can be difficult and challenging but it is getting better. I just never expect work-life balance to be our greatest strength.

Sun Jun 30 2019, Engineer,,Current Employee ,Good company but employees don't feel valued,17,"The most positive aspect of working at Micron is that the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry is an interesting work environment for all disciplines of engineering. There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain, troubleshoot and upgrade. Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant. If you like change, you will love it.
","Despite their superficial efforts, Management has never been able to make people feel valued. Sure, they love to say ""people are our most valuable resource"" but don't demonstrate it. Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories, processing machines, and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets. To make things worse, Micron has recently adopted a forced-ranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings (1 through 5) during yearly performance reviews. This is like the old GE system of terminating 10% of the workforce every year to create turnover. There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types. This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low. This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition. Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what I'm saying about the forced-ranking is not true, but I've talked with a number of mid-level managers, off the record and they've confirmed it.
Advice to Management
Eliminate the new, forced-ranking process and use a simple performance management process that examines the work people are actually doing in light of the goals of the team. Look at teams as groups of individuals that bring different skills to the work. Evaluate the contribution of people to the team instead of comparing them to some biased standard of the ""high performer"". Managers, tell people you value their contributions to the team and talk straight to low and high performers. The current system is dishonest and borderline unethical.

Many aspects of how Micron 'does business' are too complex or have been given too much latitude to operate without boundaries over the years. Seems like this is partially due to acquisitions and partially due to unprecedented growth - but now, there is a need for unification and consolidation of procedures and policies across the company that would greatly help simplify operations, reducing overhead, cost, and error. We need to get everyone speaking the same language, adhering to the same procedures across business units (where possible), and clarify and simplify execution expectations.

I have seen a steady increase in salary over the past several years that has outpaced the cost of living increases of the area and reflected pretty accurately on my performance. 
I have experienced a broad degree of autonomy on my projects and my managers give me lots of flexibility in determining how to execute tasks the way I think is best. Very little micromanaging in my experience. 
The work atmosphere is relatively low stress for how busy everyone is. I don't feel like there is ever anger or animosity between people even when things get crazy and stressful.
Opportunities for career advancement are pretty good right now (we'll see if they tighten education vs experience requirements more) but require self initiation. 
Boise area is nice if you like being outdoors and outdoor activities. The city is very clean, safe, and family friendly with lots of community parks. 
Depending on where you live, the commute to work can be just a few minutes. A number of people ride bikes to work.

","The worst thing is the silos!! When you rate a group of people and force a bell curve and cut the low performers you get everyone fighting each other for a better rating instead of promoting collaboration. Not much changes either, things get rolled out that are supposed to make things better but it feels as though they dont actually consult the people that work here and go off what is done at other companies. Things go good for a bit then they just revert to doing things the way they always do. Work life balance is also really bad, it feels like we work harder with less. Back filing positions dont happen very often so if you are short on your team expect to work more to pick up the slack. If you do work harder, expect promotion or talks of a raise only once a year on a cycle (if the company is doing good enough) otherwise you keep working hard without increase. Recognition is also hard to come by unless management is reminded to give praise. If you are looking for best in class company they are not it but for a mid tier tech company they are good.

Advice to Management
Listen to your employees. Be honest with your employees, it looks really bad when you say one thing and do another. Expecting experienced employees to train less experienced employees doesn't work well with a ranking system in place. If you think you must have a ranking system, make it transparent so lower ranking employees can plan for it and leave on their own terms. You should be fostering a culture that is working together to be better than the competition instead of fostering a culture of competition with each other in hopes the output is better than a team working together. If your vision is what's best for micron, share it with the employees, help them understand why it's the best for micron. If you can't do that, then it's probably not really whats best for micron.

Fri Jun 28 2019, Senior Engineer,"Boise, ID",Former Employee ,Don't Say I Didn't Warn You.,19,"Boise is a beautiful city, though growth is out of control. If you are young, inexperienced, fresh out of school, and desperate, this could be a springboard to a job at another company that you might actually like to work for. The CEO and upper management are not contributing to the overcrowding in Boise by actually bothering to move here and experiencing what used to make Micron special and and family oriented. Perfect place to work if you crave the absentee slumlord/landlord experience.
","Now for the bad news:
1. Micron does not care about their people nearly as much as they want to promote the appearance of caring about their people. Rather than making appropriate resources and data available to their engineers, they insert extra levels of management that will not understand what you do, what you have contributed in the past, and what you can contribute to the company's future and bottom line. They firmly believe the fount of all managerial wisdom can be found in California alone, and indeed, built an altar to their beliefs there in order to not force their guru and his minions to relocate to Boise. The incredible disconnect between management decisions based on Silicon Valley dynamics and labor pool translate very poorly in an environment where quality of life is still important. California-based managers deliberately reduced all employees to numbers, forced a bell curve assessment model of performance that falsely changed employee rankings, subsequently depriving many not out of just their deserved bonuses, but their very jobs. These rankings were not based on actual performance, but on manipulated numbers highly influenced by politics. In an interesting note: managers were somehow exempt from this ranking system and its consequences, and a curiously large percentage of terminated employees were either older, higher paid, or both.This incredibly misjudged practice has resulted in many valuable employees finding themselves out on the street; many others rejected the management by fear techniques and moved on to greener pastures. Further exacerbating the problem, they have chosen to target still more older, experienced, coincidentally higher paid employees by trying to get them to take a feeble ""early retirement"" package. It's pretty obvious at this point that catchy ""employees matter"" slogans cannot hide the fact that they actually don't.
2. If you love having to produce a gourmet meal out of ice cubes and mint leaves, you have come to the right place. Micron has taken austerity measures to a new low, leaving folks scrambling for resources and expected to make decisions by the seat of their pants. Indeed, when the problems are brought up, you are rewarded with more micromanagement and fewer resources. Good luck with that.
3. Lots of employee polls have been taken to see why people are unhappy. Clearly no one actually reads them, or management would not be so mystified. Perhaps employees have figured out that these ""anonymous"" questionnaires aren't so ""anonymous"" and can be traced back to them. Perhaps they expect to be told, again, ""If you don't like it, LEAVE!"" And yet management in California is flummoxed by the number of high quality people...leaving.
4. Micron is Big Brother these days. Your every move is tracked, 500 of your best buddies are thrown into a loud ""bullpen"" where everyone knows your business, my business, and what their neighbor ate for breakfast. Even better: you are expected to partake of this invasive and utterly chaotic atmosphere 50-60+ hours a week. Hope you are an extrovert!
5. If you are still reading this, you are a glutton for punishment. The amount of time you are expected to work definitely takes a toll on employees and their families. Good thing Micron has such excellent insurance and you can all get counseling...well, the employee can get counseling. Better have a good divorce attorney on retainer, though, because marriage counseling isn't covered! Is this hard on your relationship with your kids? Too bad, family counseling isn't covered, either. Better sock away extra money to buy their love.
6. You had better always agree with whatever ignorant nonsense your boss spouts. If you don't, you are a target in those employee bell-curve rankings. Even better is the fact that if you have any problems with your boss, you can't expect help from their boss...and you can't try to change to another department, because then you are disloyal. Suck it up, Buttercup, and brown nose as though your job depends on it, because it does.
7. If you loved school lunches as a child, brace yourself: lunches at Micron will not meet your exacting standards and will cost an order of magnitude greater than what they are worth. Take heart, though, for the fine establishments frequented by Ronald McDonald and the Burger King are nearby and provide far more quality fare.
8. But wait! There's more! Your 60 hour workweek includes 40 hours of meetings every week, many of which run late into the evening because the engineers in Singapore don't want to get up early but are sure you love to stay late for the pleasure of their wisdom. Surely your job is secure and would never move offshore...
9. Last, but not least, is the employee exercise program, where you are expected to hike two miles a day, come rain, sleet, Snowmageddon, or the blistering sun, just to get into your building and back to where you parked your car. After all, adequate parking costs money that is needed for management bonuses.
10. Okay, so #9 wasn't the last one. When you give notice, Micron walks you off the premises like a mother in law who overstayed her welcome. You may or may not receive your paycheck within the time frame proscribed by law, and your exit interview will include much lamenting by HR that they hear everything that is wrong from each employee who leaves but are truly powerless to change things, because the fount of all wisdom in California does not care. 

Summary: The culture is toxic, the work environment hostile, and management is distant and incapable of learning from mistakes. If you take a job at Micron, travel light and keep your resume updated.

Sat Jun 15 2019,N/A,, ,Inconsistent leadership at director/VP Level and almost total lack of women in executive leadership positions,3,"Micron has survived as number 2/3 memory company after Samsung/Hynix and is a US success story. Proud to be a part of that. 

Pay is decent but would like to see full transparency for male to female comparisons. 

The Boise team members in general are very dedicated and go out of their way to be helpful. 

The recent trend with more flexible working hours and location is convenient. 

Some of the changes that have taken place with Sanjay have been progressive and good for Micron.
",".
 All recent management hires I think except one have been VPs from Sandisc or Western Digital who are from India and male.

The diversity and inclusion they advertise is more on the surface and club like, it doesn’t mean there is a program to even out women in the higher level leadership positions or even identify those who would like to be. The good ole boys club is still in force unfortunately. It’s just a different nationality now. 

There is still dedicated mid level senior managers talent at Micron excited about many of the new changes but not empowered while directors and above are just frankly not managing their teams. 

This is a global company. Most jobs may require working evenings as we have Asia manufacturing sites. Be prepared. It’s expected. The unexpected part is that the organizations do not have process for justifying new headcount and many organizations run too lean. If that is the case you either have no work life balance because your work load is too much or you feel bad because you can never do as much as you would like to do. 

Top senior talent is leaving and the current leadership does not seem to have any concerns and in fact is creating policies that encourage that. The hiring strategy is one dimensional and seems short sighted to only hire new grads. But as we lose the senior level experience, who will train these new grads and how many excursions will Micron accept due to lack of senior talent and so many in training?

Rating system is not owned by direct supervisor ,thus throughout the calibration process, your number may change. This is frustrating and demoralizing to the team member and their manager.
Advice to Management
Develop a more balanced strategy for hiring that limits Sandisk applicants; limits male applicants when there is a certain male to female ratio that is fully exceeded ; identifies women who desire and are prepared for the next promotional step and helps prepare a path so that the equality of male to female leadership starts to work at Micron

Develop a corporate process for justifying headcount when needed by quantifying the benefit and the resource constraint. 

Empower your leaders to make decisions and be responsible for their teams. Introduce servant leadership. Consider a more modern performance system. Ranking is an older method that many companies have abandoned. It fosters mistrust and kills collaboration in the team. 

Develop a system for evaluating Directors and VPs. These very highly paid individuals should be the best leaders and managers. Let their team evaluate them.

","Messy, non-data-driven decision making once we get above my manager's level.

","First of all, it really depends on what team you are in and also what the job role (manager/engineer/technician or operator ) is.
I would like to mention two areas that Micron needs to work on:
1) management: My previous manager was super busy that barely had time for me. Even for my most critical needs in my career path he didn't support me. What is more important than the people building your team? isn't people one of Micron core values?? Because that manager I moved to another team, the new manager is caring and supporting. 
Second: immigration: when I joined Micron they applied for a green card after two years while other bay area tech companies usually apply for green card right after you joined or within the first few months. It seems now the apply soon. But they have outsourced the immigration support to a external company which doesn't seem doing very good. Plus, Micron usually apply for EB3 even though you have an advanced degree (master's/PhD), which makes a difference in a waiting time for green card.

Everyone works too much and too long,there is no work life balance, everyone is always on-call. Not much potential for growth. THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE OF LAYOFFS. They also implemented a Mandatory time off policy for 2 quarters so far (6 days per quarter). This causes international employees to unnecessarily use hard earned time off which they are trying to save for a visit back home. This policy is very harsh and rigid.

Truly encourage ideas by all level employees, not just to pretend. Clearly define goals and rating calculation to employees. Managers should check in weekly with new employees and try to help them grow into their roles.

Why force a ranking system when all employees are working really hard at almost the same level? If you want to layoff, do so without pretending that some people are not 'meeting expectations'. Truly encourage ideas by all level employees, not just to pretend. Clearly define goals and rating calculation to employees. Managers should check in weekly with new employees and try to help them grow into their roles.

","The work/life balance is terrible. Almost everyone shows up earlier to work than expected and almost no one leaves on time at the end of the day. You almost feel guilty for actually trying to follow your scheduled work hours since everyone else is working extra. 

A big part of this is not staffing enough technicians and not training people well enough after they get hired. This makes engineers do the technicians job in addition to their engineering duties which can be time consuming and stressful in my opinion. As for the training issue, it appears they rely on experienced individuals from other semiconductor companies to make up for the fact that they cannot grow and develop their own people.

Wed Mar 06 2019, Senior Manager,"Boise, ID",Current Employee ,Wouldn't recommend unless you have no other options,64,"- The pay is about average for the industry, which translates into good compensation if you're in a low cost area like Boise. If you're in a high-cost area, the salaries aren't as competitive.
- There are some truly good people working hard in the trenches to make a difference. These front-line folks keep the business running. Can't say the same for most of the upper management team.
- In good years, the bonus structure is fairly generous (although it's a pittance compared to the $1 Million+ productivity per worker the company has been able to achieve) 
- There is some flexibility in work environment, with things like work-from-home becoming more common.
- Benefits are fairly good, but would it could do with a much improved dental plan, a sabbatical program, and job swapping programs to give team members more visibility to other areas of the company.
- Some management chains are superb, and I'm fortunate to work in one of those organizations. Unfortunately, these are rare at Micron.
","1. Micron is turning into Sandisk v. 2.0. There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over, with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are non-American and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho, Utah or Virginia; that culture is what made Micron a success and they're killing it.
2. The executive team (the C-Suite execs in particular) are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company, seem unaware of the low morale they've created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures, and present a garbled, disjointed ""values"" system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company. For example, they espouse the value ""we care about our people"" while at the same time kicking team members out the back door.
3. The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to lay-off 10-15% of American workers every year for the next 5-7 years. While unspoken, it's become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers. Each year, 10-15% of workers will receive a failing performance grade, and while there's an alleged path to redemption, in actuality it's nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their ""performance improvement plan"". And since everyone is graded on a bell curve, every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired. This rank-and-yank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980's that it lowers morale, turns the job into a popularity contest, lowers efficiency, and just doesn't work. The fact that it's in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team, and doesn't engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful. I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme. 
4. Continuing from #3, it's obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC, shareholders, and other stakeholders. It's a legal requirement in the U.S. that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported.
5. Expect to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including on vacations, holidays, while sick, etc. With all the terminations and resignations, and with no back-filling of those positions being allowed, each team is doing the same job with less and less labor. The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings. It's a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job, never quite catching up to the work-load, being told they're failures, and morale will continue to decline. 
6. While you're expected to be on-call 24/7 and available by phone, remote connection or pager, the company doesn't provide equipment beyond a cheap 80's era pager with which to communicate (and even that's only 1 way communication). With 10+ billion in profit last year, the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 24/7 in the case of an emergency.
7. The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make $10B in stock buybacks. Even as market conditions deteriorate, the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan. This goes completely against the alleged ""progressive"" values the company purports to support.
8. Expect to have your ""priorities"" shifted on a regular basis, often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago. The company's strategic planning is non-existent, and often happens after the action period has already started. For example, it's March 2019, 6 months into the fiscal year, and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the (non-existent) strategic plan for the year. Also, everything is a top priority, which means nothing is really a priority, and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments.
9. Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments, and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful C-Suite exec. I've been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VP's and Directors scream and cuss at each other, and I've even seen several people threatening violence. Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point:
10. Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980's era thinking. Management by fear. Management by negativity. Management by impossible expectations. Management by dictate. Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members.
11. The company is slowly shifting American workers to India - expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being off-shored.
12. The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible. The lighting is bad, people are packed in like sardines, the decor is drab, there's very little natural light, and overall it doesn't contribute to happy, healthy and productive workers.
13. The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised. Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions, shifting priorities, opaque direction from the executive team, the fear of dropping into the bottom 15%, the hostility from management towards mid-management and front-line team members, and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally. The company has offered mental health services to team members, but it's attacking the symptoms without touching the underlying root problems.
Advice to Management
1. Kill the rank-and-yank system and be transparent about the change, with an acknowledgement that it was a mistake and the company will do better to protect its workers.
2. Either change the way the COO operates or remove him from the company. He's managed to drive away a lot of really good talent, and is a cancer on morale. His strategies are old-school and don't work, and he's a shameless promoter of moving jobs, IP, and mind-share to India.
3. Move the senior executive team back to Boise. If they don't want to live in Boise, then they're probably not a good fit for Micron. Boise isn't Silicon Valley and they shouldn't try to turn Micron into a SV company.
4. Stop the meetings. It's not uncommon to have 15 or 20 meetings in a day, with many time slots double or triple booked. The meetings accomplish almost nothing, and require the attendees to do their real job after hours, early in the morning or on the weekends. Put a stop to the 4 AM, 9 PM, and Saturday meetings. We spend so much time accommodating Asian time schedules that it's killing American workers productivity and morale. 
5. Enact a policy that every worker has 4 hours every week/month (say on a Friday afternoon) to work on whatever project they want, as long as it benefits the company. This encourages innovation and allows every worker to contribute to something beyond their day job. This would improve morale.
6. Don't just publish the company values - live them. I don't see a lot beyond lip service.
7. For the executives - start getting face-to-face with your team members. Not in a top down thou-shalt-do-this type of all hands meetings. Actually spend some time with your teams to see what they do, what their pain points are, and how YOU can help with the challenges they face on a day to day basis. Visit as a listener rather than as someone who's just dictating demands.
8. Provide better, more transparent ways to allow feedback for team members on senior executives. That I have to use Glassdoor to point out the problems with the executive team is absurd. The company is not going in a good direction and there's no good place to provide feedback for the average worker where they can feel safe to be honest and open about the challenges they face.

Opportunities to advance if in the right departments
Recent emphasis on work-life balance
Workplace amenities for those interested in them: cafeterias, gyms, onsite healthcare
Good benefits
Compensation is generally reasonable, (can depend on department - con)
","Recent bell curve ratings is causing morale problems, works against stated values of ""people"" and ""collaboration"", the system assumes that someone who has worked up to engineer 4, for example, and who is rated in the lowest 2-3% of E4's is not a valuable employee and needs to get their act together or find employment somewhere else, devalues experience and aggregate knowledge
Communication has become condescending when addressing changes which employees might consider other than positive
Leadership can come across as out of touch
Opportunities for advancement and salary adjustment can vary by department
Advice to Management
Value all of your employees. Have high expectations, and make it easy for leadership to either help low performers or walk them, but give the leadership in the trenches the ability to make that call. Enforcing the percentage year over year will soon result in loss of talent we don't want to lose. Don't talk down to employees and treat changes made for business needs as if they are also for the good of the employee personally.

2. Fantastic co-workers, some of the best engineers in the industry.
3. Nice work culture and work-life balance, at least in R&D (deteriorating rapidly).
4. Compensation base + bonus reasonably good for Idaho.
5. Relatively easy to move within the organization.
6. Good on-the-job training for NCGs and Interns.
","1. The location. Let's be honest, Boise is not the most fun place on this planet. The city is inexpensive, and there is a very good reason why.
2. Quite a few teams are understaffed. Add to that, an extreme lack of co-ordination between different teams and tonnes of pointless meetings. 
3. Cafetaria. The options are limited and mediocre at best. Virtually nothing for vegetarians. And there are no restaurants in a 5 mile radius which makes things worse.
4. Really slow, tedious and erratic promotion process by industry standards.
5. Continuous shuffles and re-shuffles making life miserable for the engineers. Rolling around like headless chicken rarely help.
6. The new 'rank and yank' system based on PPA which was introduced last year. Scores of really good engineers were kicked out due to this approach, at a time when Micron is one of the most profitable companies in the world (3B+ operating income per quarter, for past 6 quarters). It seems most managers were not in favor of this, but leaders in this company are not really renowned for their fortitude. So, no one took the fight to the upper management. And we are all paying the price now. It has been barely 3 weeks since NYE, and already 10+ engineers resigned and left. And with Intel, YTMC and WD recruiters on the prowl for Micron talent, this is all set to get worse in the coming months. It is just unbelievably frustrating that the engineers who are some of the finest and developing some of the most complex technologies in the world need to go through this pain.
Advice to Management
Micron is not a company and Boise is not a location for which engineers are willing to put their career and livelihood on the line. You cannot treat your employees like Amazon and pay them like ON semiconductor. That just doesn't work. Things need to improve fast and this new PPA approach needs to go.

","Unfortunately over the last few years, things are changing. Managers and senior management are leaving left and right. Their replacements are often quick placement instead of correct placement if they are even replaced. There is a lot of leadership talent in non- manager rolls begging for the opportunity to prove they cane do the task, but are never afforded the opportunity. Instead, you end up with unqualified managers and with no leadership skills who are good at managing up, and terrible leading those below. This has lead to huge moral problems in the company. That along with review process where they force a bell curve which means you’re competing with everyone else in the company to just get a meets expectations. The curve is as follows, forced to each manager whether their team is 3 or 30 headcount: 
0-5%. - 1 and immediate termination
10% - 2 and performance improvement plan or separation package
60% -3 and you get to keep your job until the next culling
20% - 4 increased bonus (140%)
5% - 5 greater increased bonus (200%)

These will probably change before the end of FY19 but we won’t be informed until near the end of the fiscal year. Like in 2018 we were tolds 2s were safe, until you got a 2 and given a PIP impossible to meet (like obtain a college degree in 3 months).

It feels like we don’t matter anymore. We’re just another line item in some sheet. 

And forget getting raises! I have my PM title but I don’t even do PM work anymore. I’ve consumed roles from 3 other people who have left the company and haven’t made a penny more for th added time and effort. Having both early morning 5:30am and late night 8:00pm meetings. I get a cost of living increase once a year, but due to increased insurance each year, my net increases are in the $40 a month range. 

Long story short, your happiness here can be directly related to the quality of your Manager. I’ve had amazing managers, 2 who left the company for other opportunities because they couldn’t handle their managers. One I lost due to a re-.org because my department had lost so many leaders in 6 months and the reporting structure got severely messed up. It still is messed up with poor communication and no leadership/direction.
Advice to Management
Reevaluate how you review your employees. Some people are failing because you keep dumping more work on them. They fall behind then they get fired. Look into why your employees are leaving. There are exit interviews, do you even look into why someone has decided to leave? If a high performing team with no churn loses 1/2 its employees after a new Manager is placed on the team, maybe look at the managers performance and not criticizing the team who are choosing to stay. They’re running with 1/2 the resources necessary just trying to keep their head above waters. Do your job so we can do ours.

Mon Feb 25 2019, Senior Engineer,"Manassas, VA",Former Employee ,Micron Manassas experience,9,"Micron Manassas used to be a good company and so the one star is meant for the last 2 years or so. I stayed there from 2005-2018, working on various roles from shift engineering, process, integration, quality with some reassignments at Boise, ID and Singapore ... my good experiences are summarized as follows:
- good location for single individuals or young families. Manassas in general have the worst schools and crime in the area but the adjacent 'Linton Hall' and Fairfax districts have some of the best schools.
- Proximity to Washington DC (less than an hour's drive by car). Its like living close to Paris or Rome if you were to ask me. Close to Shenandoah State Park (again, less than an hour's drive). Northern VA is good if you are into Civil War history. Drive up and down and you'll be in Pennsylvania (Amish, Gettsyburg), Maryland (National Aquarium, NASA), North Carolina (Duke Univ, beaches)... Manhattan/NYC is 6 hours' drive up north.
- peers are generally nice, helpful and work really hard. 
- they send you to vendor training and will pay for your schooling as long as it fits your job role.
- they support green card applications for foreign workers.
- generous time off hours accumulation but whether or not they will approve your leave is another question.
-good 401k match at 6%. Need 4 yrs to vest.
- good training program like process classes, statistics. mentoring culture is terrible and likely non-existent in most groups.
","- salary is low if you would factor in the cost of living in the area. Northern VA is one of the most expensive in the US. $140,000/yr wont get you even a townhouse, which starts at $400,000. HOA's are another $250/mo. Of course there are cheaper options but pretty much you wont like it (1950's old brick houses in unsafe neighborhoods).
- management will tell everything to motivate you but deliver way short after you did your part of the bargain. they say do this and that and we'll get you promoted ... after exceeding the requirements and after a few months later you are still engineer 1. Boss will say that you are 'almost there' except for 1-2 things you need to improve on ... then you get a fresh to do list and the cycle continues. There's an unwritten expectation of working 55 hours or so minimum if you want to be 'good in their eyes'.
- promotion is not based on your performance alone. it is also based on how well you get the senior managers to like you. salesmanship and impression management will get you further than tangible accomplishment. quiet type engineers are at a disadvantage.
- work-life balance does not exist unless you work on 3-4 day shift. it is pretty common for non-shift people to work 55-60 hours a week. If you have a meeting at 7-8pm, you still need to show up at 7:45 am the following day. You are required to be contactable even in the middle of the night, and you are expected to work at home thru remote PC connection - and this is not counted as 'work hours'.
-yearly evaluations are based on how good you are compared to your peers ... you will be ranked against others. this made not a few people become selfish of how they do their work so as to be ranked better than others. if you are new, good luck figuring the ropes out.
- cyclical layoffs. I survived 3-4 layoffs so far and this means more work for the remaining workforce. Everybody is overworked, resulting in consistent attrition of workers. Most of who stayed are either foreign workers waiting for their permanent residency, older 50+ workers, or rank and file operators and technicians.
- most first level managers are chinese or indian so chances are youll have an asian boss (again due to permanent residency issue, they have no choice but to stay). this would translate into a more asian style 'sweatshop' approach to management than the more liberal 'consensus based' american style we love. favoritism also play well at times in getting hot jobs i.e. expat assignments.
- cafeteria food is terrible, not to mention the cubes are 1980's style light blue cloth with light brown steel frame and light gray cabinets. computers are slow but they change it every 6 years. i went to some offsite training before and i was handed over an old heavy laptop and corded mouse for use. i volunteered to use mine instead and just accessed my work PC remotely. 
- Parking is insufficient. Need to come early to secure a good spot.
- No gym.

Bottomline: workers are not well taken cared of based on their treatment and their general workplace. A lot have already left and moved on.

Sat Jan 12 2019, Process Engineer,"Boise, ID",Current Employee ,Good work-life balance but a work-culture stuck in the past.,10,"1. I have worked at many semiconductor companies and Micron has the best work-life balance -- hands down.
2. Boise is very inexpensive and safe. It is a great place for a family especially if your political/social leanings are conservative.
3. Good pay if you get a good rating on the annual review.
4. With record revenue, management is investing on better amenities (new buildings, better cafeteria etc)
5. Easy mobility within Micron from one team to the other
","1. POLITICS & BUREAUCRACY: 
For an R&D site, Micron Boise has an appalling level of work politics and bureaucracy. Most teams do not see eye-to-eye. There is severe infighting. Teams have conflicting goals. Process Development and manufacturing development are at loggerheads. DRAM and NAND process teams bay for each others blood. New engineers and legacy engineers do not get along. Nothing gets moving and to perform a simple project, you need approval from several stakeholders which practically is impossible.
Team leads and mid-level managers do not bring this lack of sync to the notice of senior management because they are scared of being reprimanded. They sweep everything under the rug and solely focus on their own rating.

2. HARSH RATING SYSTEM AND CONSTANT LAYOFFS:
Micron drives the bell curve system to the T. You are rated on a scale of 1-5. All employees receiving a 1 or 2 (approx. 10-15% of every team without an exception) is given a severance package or placed on immediate probation. I have personally seen several teams where these ratings were not solely based on performance but based on proximity to your immediate manager. You disagree with your manager --> you will be shown the door mercilessly. 

3. WORK CULTURE:
As a site that has been around for over 40 years, Micron's work culture is alteast 10 years behind what other semicon companies have. 
You will find it is especially HARD to break through if you are new or perceived as an outsider (from a different company, area). No one will even listen to you. Talk about data-based decision making.

Bottomline is -----> If you are a mid-senior engineer or manager, looking for a slow life, good work-life balance, a safe place to settle down, if you are religious/conservative, Boise and Micron would be a paradise.
If you are liberal or a fresh college grad or a minority of any kind, looks elsewhere. Not worth the shot at the least!

 If you work shift work you will have to work nights every 4 months which can get pretty hard on the body especially if you are constantly rotating back to a day schedule on your days off. If you work M-F 8 to 5pm you will most likely because a slave to your job with little to no flexibility in your schedule. You will also spend at least 50% of your day in useless meeting where 90% of the people in the meeting are just starting at their laptop. When you finally get some work done just make sure not to mess up because you will never hear something like ""good job"" or ""nice work today"". You will only hear something when you mess up and they are telling you. Also, do expect to move up in company unless you have a friend in high places because this is one of the most bias places I have ever worked. On paper everything looks good and legal to HR but behind the sense they pull some shading stuff. Overall, just know that nepotism is high and moral is low.

The work-life balance is awesome. Since what you do doesn't matter and the project you work on will get cancelled anyway, you don't have to work long hours nor even work all that hard because you and your work don't matter.

Especially the time-off, which is imperative for maintaining one's sanity at this place. Pay is lower than industry average, partly b/c of the lack of job market competition in the Boise area.
","Shift work by its nature is tedious, repetitive, and mind-numbing. Add to that the pain of rotating to night shifts every 4 months and the conditions for a soul-sapping corporate cog job are created. Indeed there are opportunities to move off of shift. But somehow being a process owner working 50-60 hours/week and being on-call 24/7 does not sound much better. The shift crews also have many stars and stripes good-old boy types that somehow gained the title of 'engineer' without a real engineering degree. If you wish to be surrounded by Trump supporters with myopic perspectives of the world, shift might be for you.

The work environment became hostile in Oct-Nov 2018 when the performance-based 'soft-layoffs' occurred. I performed well and benefitted, but many folks who performed equally as well were rated lower and paid the price; I cannot help but feel some level of guilt even if these things are beyond my control. The consequences of this rating system will eventually take its toll on this company. Some areas are even identifying and holding onto their '1s and 2s' now so they can ax them come performance review time. How on earth is this indicative of the 'tenacious' and 'people-based' culture that leadership continues to extoll? I think now is a good time to GTFO of Micron.

Every company has there good and bad, and, mostly I think Micron is good. Micron is a very diverse company, family oriented, with very decent benefits.
","The new CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, has done some good, but, unfortunately the new system of forced bell curve ranking has changed my views of Micron. The last couple of years Micron has done very well and this year the bonus was probably the best I've ever seen. Yet, the recent layoffs using the forced bell curve ranking system have overshadowed the happiness that one should feel with Micron's success. 

I've seen and heard of terrible stories of good people getting low scores. Some of the scores were based on lies to help justify the low scores to remove individuals. Some stories of managers leaving Micron because they were being forced to give a low score when the individual didn't deserve it. 

Micron has had layoffs before and usually there is good justification for it. This last layoff, I have yet to understand the justification for it. Financially, this is the best that Micron has ever done. Sure, there are poor performers, they should be handled individually and appropriately.

Micron use of the forced bell curve ranking really doesn't make sense. It uses fear to increase performance, colleagues are now competing in the hope of keeping a high score and the collaboration goes down. You job is in question every year. If you do a google search for ""bell curve forced ranking"", you will find several articles stating that this method is outdated and doesn't increase performance and should not be used. 

It is for this reason I have hard time referring and recommending Micron to others. I really hope Micron re-evaluates this method.

Tue Nov 27 2018, R&D Engineer,"Boise, ID",Current Employee ,R&D Engineer,14,"Boise is a small and pretty city.
","Summary:
Very poor work-life balance - Less paid off time after new CEO toke office - Seriously week technical Leads and Managers - Vey cheap culture - extremely less career development and growth opportunities - Too political 

Recent Measures:
• With new CEO, company turn over has increased hugely, and don't be too excited if you get an offer these days, as many kids are leaving. Ask for big pay, they have no choice, possibly they will accommodate you. 
• The new CEO has also came up with 7% layoff each year. If your manager wants to get rid of you, she/he will give you a low score, bing, you will need to go. Remember that there are no other opportunities in Boise other than Micron. For this reason, think really twice when you wana move to Idaho.

Career Opportunities:
• There are literally fewer opportunities to move up in the company. It's heavily depends on "" like-ability"" not on your experience and qualifications. Experience and good team members’ left/leaving the team after a Non-qualified team member was assigned as lead. Shocking ... I can see this behavior across the department. 

Compensations & Benefits:
• The pay is less than industry average. Often said Boise is a cheap city, however it's not as cheap as said at all. Recent migration from other states to Idaho has made the cost of living pretty high, housing is pricy; off course cheaper than Bay Area.
• The new CEO has cut the 6th month bonus from last year, though company has historic revenue last year.
• From this year, 4 of paid off days are removed from your flexible off time. The CEO office emailed us saying that “ to improve work-life balance”. Can you believe it?
• The new policy won’t allow you to accumulate your leave for long time, you are forced to use them, or they will expire. I have heard from our international kids that this policy is hurting them a lot as they need long leave to travel and visit their family abroad. 

Work/Life Balance:
• Though you may carry R&D title, work in here is 24/7, you get Paged almost every night. You are expected to reply Pages within 2 hours; otherwise your Manager will be Paged. The new CEO has came up with the idea of 12 months cadence, meaning product cycle is decreased from 24 month to 12 months, without increasing team members numbers.

Senior Management:
• You will be shocked to see how poor the technical Leads and Managers are. They don't understand the technical details of your work, so won't appreciate it.

Culture & Values:
• If you are from top 50 US universities, you will be very alone here. Kids here are from schools you haven't heard of, or some cases with no formal education. I came across a former bar tender that was teaching Engineer kids about a semiconductor tool.
• Company has a very poor and cheap culture. Engineers are treated like kids and often managers openly say that the main responsibility of an Engineer is to make lead/manager happy, that’s it, and you guess the rest. Since you are in Idaho, you are treated like you haven’t seen decent cities or never interacted with decent people. Recently we have couple of coffee machines installed across campus; we keep getting emails from managers on how great we are and how greatly we are celebrating our success. Dude, almost every village on this Planet has coffee machine.

I have been working at Micron Technology full-time
Pros
Some co workers are friendly, helpful, and collaborative. Good pay, large operating budget. Very nice amenities, onsite coffee, refreshments, and food.
Cons
Often a very toxic work culture, where a “blame and shame” policy prevails. Work processes are not respected, politics and favoritism abound, and team members criticize others’ work to feel relevant. Fear is the primary motivator, as most TMs have been with the company so long they can’t afford a pay cut elsewhere.

Apparently, all of the most qualified people just happened to have worked at Sandisk - who knew. The number of VP, Senior VP, Executive VP has swollen beyond the point of ridiculous.
Advice to Management
Keep Micron great. Some of the more recent moves such as to force time off are poorly veiled ways to reduce benefits in the name of 'work life balance'. 

Constantly filling the Upper Ranks with Sandisk buddies is killing moral. Historically, there were clear (if not difficult) development paths that led into the upper ranks. You've effectively sent the message that hiring from within is no longer a thing. 

HR needs to get its act together and decide on a consistent message and process that truly benefits the teams rather than be the spokesperson to try to spin a poor decision by execs as a benefit to the people. 

I'm rating Culture and Values lower because the culture is being forced into the Bay area Culture. There are some good things it's brought such as flexible work hours (still more theoretical than practical) but with it comes the expectation to compete w/ coworkers to beat them out as top performer or risk being the loser in a forced distribution rating system (even if your team is full of rock stars, someone has to be rated low). It's an odd message to say we value the People but were going to create a cutthroat environment. I suppose this mentality works in Bay area where you can walk across the street and get a new job - likely at a pay raise. However, in areas like Boise, job security, and company/employee loyalty are real values and part of the culture. You would find a much stronger workforce if you built on that.

Manassas site usually runs the legacy products but still you get to learn both DRAM, NAND and NOR technologies. Great benefits. Headquarter office works hard to improve work life balance with policies. Nice industry reputation.
","Manassas location has a very poor management. Goals are intentionly set higher than reasonable margins and managers are held accountable for not meeting those numbers. That pressure bubbles up while coming down to individual contributors. People are set for failure. For the last 18 months, the attrition rate was immensely high. Higher management covered up this problem by reporting to the corporate that lower performers were leaving the company. I personally know at least 15 incredible engineers left the company during that time. Some of them were the only ones who knew how the most critical equipments in photolithography area breaths in and out. That attrition impacted the plant operation which made the upper management even more fierceful. All of the mid- management is in survival mode to not to get in trouble with upper leadership and they don’t have any bravery to back up their direct reports. People are expected to work long hours. If they don’t, it impacts their performance review.
Advice to Management
Check the effectiveness of Manassas management. Conduct more frequent site visits and talk to the middle management. Do not rely on the personal relationship of the site leadership with the VP level leaders. Have some focus table discussions with individual contributors.

Mon Feb 12 2018, Software Engineer,"Boise, ID",Current Employee ,An environment that is changing and improving quickly,3,"- Lots of diversity here: management and employees of many different races/ethnicities, lots of international collaboration (including travel)

- Flexible schedules: Show up when you want and leave when you want, work from home

- Solid benefits: Competitive salary, bonuses, raises, stock, stock options, decent paid time off, decent retirement plan options

- Colleagues are generally very nice and supportive with varying degrees of knowledge, intelligence, and skills

- Low-stress environment: Rooms with ping-pong, treadmill desks, yoga, darts, couch + TV, etc, depending on the building you work in. Break rooms with lots of snacks. Good cafeteria (definitely compared to a few years ago). Wellness program that awards points for steps and other activities which can be redeemed for gift cards or rewards

- Great mobility for moving to other departments/areas

- Lots of ""extra-curricular"" events/opportunities: women's groups, community activism, diversity initiatives, technical seminars, etc.

- Company used to operate like it was in the stone ages, but it's fast-forwarding in the present with the new leadership; department structures are flattening and transforming into self-managing teams, employee recognition and incentives are improving quickly.

- Money: The company is swimming in it. Assuming you're not in a department that has a very low budget, expect department BBQs with beer, training sessions that are catered, and having to spend insane amounts of time interviewing and recruiting because of how much we're hiring!

- Not a ""starter"" company: employees of all different ages, very low turnover for the industry
","- Inconsistency: Micron is a huge place with a major hierarchy of management. Different areas operate very differently as far as how they treat employees and advance their careers, how discerning their hiring is, etc. Certain departments/divisions are DEFINITELY better to work for than others. Be prepared to move around if you end up in the ""wrong"" place. Hopefully the new leadership will drive better alignment.

- Poor management training: I've heard too many horror stories of leads and managers who never took Management 101 and frustrated their direct reports to no end. The company as of now does not mandate any sort of upward feedback, so unless you complain, things don't generally change. I'm hoping that the new leadership recognizes this and things improve. The good part is that there are competitive leaders in the company: it's just trial and error to find them.

- Overly hierarchical structure: Lots of managers and lots of VPs. When things have to go up a large chain, visibility into decisions gets lost, actions aren't taken, and people get frustrated. In IT, they are pushing a flatter, Agile structure, but I fear for other departments in the company. A more progressive stance would be that all departments in the company push for self-managing structures.

- Regressive mentality: Micron has been doing many things ""the old way"" for far too long. This leads to engineers using old methods or practices that are now extremely deprecated, and not enough people recognize it to drive change. Certain departments are making every effort to embrace best-in-class practices and methodologies, but others don't.
Advice to Management
Mandate a more progressive vision downwards so everyone embraces it and everyone is aligned. This will ensure that only the best talent is recruited and kept, and teams and departments are being managed effectively.

The starting pay is alright, good for Boise. Regular stock options, and stock offerings. The health center is really sweet!

Culture there is more conservative overall, that can be a pro or a con depending on how you lean.

Work life balance is ok, depends on the department a lot, but I didn't really have an issue with this. They allowed me to work from home during ice storms or when sick.

They do encourage learning and growth within your existing role, taking college classes always gets approved.

I didn't leave Micron because Micron, I left because I wanted to live someplace else, If you're an engineer and want to live in Boise, Micron is your best bet, and it's not a bad bet either. Some of the best engineers I've ever worked with were at Micron.
","Well, it's conservative, for me that was a tad bit of a con, yes, it's a good ol' boys club, I can deal but come on, it's the 21st century.

They promote and give raises very very slowly, so your pay gets less competitive over time unless you complain loud and outperform everyone else. They also don't support career changes, want to change tracks? Good luck, they like to keep you where you're at.

Sometimes getting new ideas implemented requires going through a lot of office politics, especially if some senior person is pushing their idea and wants to get another pip on their collar. The politics can get nasty, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.

They also seem to hire senior leaders based on politics and not qualifications, one director I worked under claimed to be a big shot at a former company, I asked around at that company, no one even remembered his name let alone knew what he did. Again, more politics.
Advice to Management
First, invest in your people, give people a real career path. Part of that will require breaking up the little office empires. There have been some good steps towards this in the last few years I was there, keep that momentum going.

Get rid of the petty office politics, find ways to discourage that behavior, it stifles innovation and reduces productivity which ultimately hurts the bottom line.

Stop hiring leaders based on either who they know of what crazy stuff they claim they can do or have done, start checking references more and bringing in people based on merit, these yahoos are driving certain departments into the ground.

There is a lot of opportunity to impact the success of the new game-changing products that are in the works, and the work extends far beyond simply writing code to test chips: there's a lot of understanding the physics and materials of the chips, the ways they fail, and the hardware they're tested on.

","A legacy parts producer with a limited shelf life that no longer budgets for employee appreciation.
The company remains nearly 85% male and this sexism is furthered by promoting men to lower management positions from strongly male dominated cultures who may not even be aware they tend to promote men before women.
Micron has been working to reduce redundancy and non value tasks in Fab positions, but rarely rises to middle management jobs. 
Currently workers at the bottom of the production chain have picked up the off load of jobs from both the process and the tool sides. MT's are now very few with generally double the workload they started with, but very very minimal increase in pay. No one knows how much work came actually correctly completed in one 12 hour shift. It seems like a strange strategy for cost cutting. Employee headcount goes down to bare bones causing their workload to increase even more, which leads to greater risk to the product and lower tool efficiency. Does eliminating low end low paying jobs save enough money to offset scrapped wafers and loss of tool production time? Even when you consider these employees are doing double duty for essentially the same pay rate? Wouldn't retaining low cost labor instead provide an opportunity for a better distribution of work which could easily translate to less human scrap and less lost production time for tool malfunctions?
Last, it doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you know, how well you document your development, if you ask for additional responsibilities or for development opportunities to benefit your performance. There is just one person, one person who can either help you get where you really want to go or make your life so miserable you can't even let it go once you've left for the day. They can count on your participation, use you to any extent they need, but toss you off the bus solely because they like someone better, and I've seen people go just because a manager has to chop heads, and he personally prefers someone else. How in 2017 can an international company hope to succeed when it doesn't even realize that from the top down, they promote managers who chooses employees not for their value to the company, but in a personality contest.

","The senior management team at micron needs to go. They don't understand that the world is not a DRAM, don't see that continuing to do business as usual and ignore the changing landscape will not work, and won't give new blood the chance to influence direction. They are smart enough to realize that they need to branch out, but keep failing by trying to force all projects into the paradigm they expect. When projects cannot flourish on a memory chip model, they invariably under fund them and expect unrealistic schedules. Other programs they force into memory design paradigms and then don't kill or rethink them even after years of failed revisions and missed market windows. 
Unless you are a member of the old boys club, you will never be promoted into the upper tiers of the engineering ladder, and will have very little chance of influencing the company to the better.

Manager would throw you under the bus to make him/her to continue to look good. My main job function was to make my manager look good. Not do what was best for the customer or the company. The culture will suck the life out of you. As with most companies there are good managers and bad ones. Problem is that the majority of the managers there are bad. If you want to move around, you better ask around to see how will be leading the team and make an informed decision.

","The fortunes of the company are completely dependent on DRAM pricing, which is cyclical. It's either feast or famine with hiring, raises and expense budgets, regardless of which division one reports to.
In spite of well publicized initiatives to become a systems company 4 or 5 years ago, Micron has failed to make this happen. This is especially pronounced in the SSD business where the company relies on third parties to do the majority of the design and development work.
Advice to Management
Micron has a reputation for making big technology announcements to the press and not following through. This is a bad reputation to have and it is echoed in the way the non-DRAM portions of the company operate. 

The executive leadership is made up of people who may understand DRAM, but not much else. Much of the power is centered in Boise and the executive staff is very insular. The executives know that they need to get some products that can weather DRAM booms and busts, but choose to go invent markets for automata processors or 3D XPoint memory, instead of focusing on the under served SSD market. Poor hiring decisions at the director and VP level, a management revolving door, and killing projects at exactly the wrong time wrecked morale and contributed to a lot of infighting. The executive management really needs to ask what kind of company do they want Micron to be? Where are their blind spots? How willing are they to work with outsiders? Are they willing to do their homework to be successful in new business arenas? There has been very little introspection about why Micron has failed to deliver on SSD. It sure isn't for a lack of talent in the engineering rank and file.

","Pay is not commensurate with the cost of living in Manassas, No bonuses / IPP during tough times, which seem to occurring very often lately, Layoffs not handled well, Insane pressure from management, Blatant disregard for so-called company values, Visa processes take forever to complete.

Micron has been going through a bad time ever since I started working here. Upper management prefers eliminating bonuses and reducing headcount to compensate for the losses, rather than actually making more quality products. It has come to a point where the same amount of work is being dumped on very few people, yet management insists that ""if it's possible, we will do it"". It's just not sustainable over a long period. Very soon, all the good employees will voluntarily start leaving, if they don't get laid off first. The recent layoffs were very badly handled, with senior employees and genuinely good contributors to the company were laid off without explanation. Overall a bad work-environment.
Advice to Management
Please let the M1 and M2 level managers take the decision for laying off junior employees. Upper management has no clue what sort of work we do, and taking arbitrary decisions that play with people's careers will only be harmful for the company as a whole. I don't see the Manassas site staying in operation for far too long if this is the reaction to every downturn in the market. If you need to compensate for your losses, lay off someone in the upper management. You will save much more money, and the company can actually function better with all its grass-root workers still intact.

You do not receive calls at all hours of the night

","The quality of your experience depends on your middle management, if they are great and work with you towards your goals then you will succeed... if not you will fail.
The industry is cyclical and when they do reductions they don't do them gradually, they conduct reductions in massive sweeps.
If you work on the 1st shift (day shift as a development engineer) expect to be called at all hours of the night if your process is not effective. You can be assigned terrible processes and have to recover from other people's failings.
If you work on shift as a process engineer, you are accountable for all and any mistakes made while you were dealing with something. Yet, if you are handed a mess that causes excursions by someone not on shift they take no blame and have no consequences.

Fri Apr 01 2016, Engineer,"Boise, ID",Former Employee ,Terrible Performance Review Process,1,"I posted one review of this company and am posting another (Glassdoor allows one per year, per company). I posted some positive comments in a previous review. I have no new ""pros"" to add.
","My updated review describes the traumatizing performance review process this company had in place during my employment. The overall process is typical. Rate yourself on a scale of 1 through 5 for each ""Micron behavior."" You can look up lengthy descriptions of each behavior on Micron's website, which is time-consuming. Add comments that support your rating. Also, state whether or not you met your annual goals, and why. Then, create new annual goals. Even though this process is typical, it is not easy because I was provided with no training. 

Before meeting with my supervisor to go over my performance review, I had to complete a ""360 review"" on her. On Micron's website, you can find out that 360 reviews are shared with managers, but comments are anonymous. No one told me this information - instead, I had to read it on the website. I cautiously submitted the review with a lot of negative comments about my supervisor, because I didn't think I could refuse to submit it. The review was actually sent directly (unfiltered) to my manager. She couldn't see my name on it, but she knew who said which comments about her. She didn't have a large number of employees, and she could easily figure it out. Not many people in the company seemed to know that 360 reviews would be sent directly without any filtering, and from what I heard from my manager, people were upset. After my manager received her 360 reviews, I noticed that she seemed even more moody than usual. She also had not completed the performance reviews for her employees. Before our meeting, but after receiving her 360 reviews, she told me she was still finishing my performance review. Anyone should be able to see the problem with this and know where I am going next. Well, during our meeting, she went over many negative comments that she wrote on my performance review. Most of them related to my personality, not my performance. Several of them were very nitpicky. Before this meeting, she had praised my performance and never said anything negative about it. The only thing she said that could be possibly be taken as a negative was that I could be a little bit clearer when stating my reasoning for positions I took. We both had already agreed that I was responsive to this suggestion, so there wasn't much room to comment negatively on it during the review. The final thing that made me know that she had read my 360 review and reacted to it in my performance review was that she said during our meeting that she knew which comments I made in my 360 review and asked why I hadn't brought them up before. I was shocked that she would risk her job by admitting this to me.

I complained to HR about this performance review, and they investigated it. Amazingly, I was never told that they found evidence of retaliation, so I assume they believe there wasn't any. They did tell me that they would talk to her about using the performance review in a more appropriate and productive way. The experience has made my very wary of review processes and felt traumatizing, but I am slowly beginning to heal after several months with my current, much more positive employer.
Advice to Management
Do not send 360 reviews to managers without filtering the comments and synthesizing the comments first. Hold managers accountable for giving and receiving training on performance reviews, and require employee performance reviews to be completed before 360 reviews are received.

The company goes through it's cycles of up and downs like any other tech company and everyone is aware of the potential for layoffs depending on how the market is doing. Manufacturing also means being on call 24/7 unless you're a supporting role in ""non-value added"" departments. There's a certain ceiling you hit as far as moving up. There are always job openings on the manufacturing floor but fewer job openings for 8AM to 5PM work schedule. Even if you get a position that's 8-5 it doesn't mean you' only work 8-5 because you'll be on call. Making the transition from the manufacturing floor to the office can be difficult unless you know the right people and you're a little lucky. There still exists an ""us vs. them"" mentality between those who work on the floor and those who work in the engineering offices. Life can be stressful and unpredictable. Even though you can accumulate a lot of paid time off, it doesn't mean you'll be able to use them if you're working on an important project or if another member of your team is scheduled out at the same time or if your team is severely short handed.

Get more focused on meaningful compensation metrics. There's currently a somewhat idealistic executive focus on lofty corporate metrics rather than meaningful ""in the trenches"" feedback for individuals. Other than sheer professionalism (which varies) there's little individual accountability.

Advice to Management
No company would allow a middle manager to dispose of a piece of valuable equipment without oversight. Long-time employees have real value that can be calculated in dollars. Before allowing a manager to get rid of someone for personal reasons, questions should be asked about how that employee got where they are -- years of demonstrated ability, talent and growth -- and why they are suddenly deemed useless and worthy of being tossed out. Curiosity of this type is missing here, replaced with blind support of managers, who sometimes make mistakes.
