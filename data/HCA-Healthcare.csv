Management always overheard telling staff they can be replaced easily
Charge nurses are young and not prepared well enough to charge
Leaders lie- tell you one thing and do the opposite; also loves to create a hostile environment between staff, nurses and floors by not following their own policy
Orientation is poor- expect you to know policy without giving you the policy, and in some cases do not know the correct policy
HR is a waste of time- no help in resolving matters or answering questions.
Pay is horrible- lowest paying hospital in NVa. No mid-shift diffs
Leaders deduct time for lunch even if you don't take a break. Employees do not have access to their time sheet.

","Everything is about ratios and numbers, not about safety. The CCU will sometimes have 3:1 ratios and the pediatric unit is almost always only staffed with ONE person. The nursing supervisors have a complete disregard for safety, and will argue that a second person isn't needed to staff a unit. Depending on which supervisor is working, you may even get yelled at for calling them with a concern! Nurses are floated from unit to unit without proper training and again, with total disregard for patient safety. There is no continuity of care, as a nurse may be floated to three units in one shift. If you are unlucky enough to work on a unit such as pediatrics, where you will be alone for 12 hours, there is no one around. So, you will not be relieved for a break, not even to go to the bathroom. You will also not know who is coming or going from your unit as it is unlocked and isolated, putting you and your patients at risk. Your opinions will also go unheard in this hospital, so I do not recommend working here.
Advice to Management
Hire more staff. Staff your units (pediatrics!) with 2+ people. You can not have a unit open and run safely with one person. Teach your nursing supervisors this and teach them to treat their coworkers with basic human decency. Staffing a hospital full of travel nurses is not how to staff a hospital!!!!
