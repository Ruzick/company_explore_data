I worked at DXC Technology full-time for more than a year
Pros
I liked the people I worked with and got the experience I needed in this industry
Cons
Company doesn't care much for their employees. It was obvious from when I started that they would rarely promote within. I was hired on as a junior consultant, but shortly after I was hired most Sr level staff had left. As I continued my career, I started doing the work that I would consider above my position level. I didn't have much guidance or coaching or training with the exception of the first couple of weeks when I started. My managers rarely knew what was going on above him, he tried to be open, but it didn't help that no one was communicating with him either. I didn't mind at first as I thought and was told promotions/pay raises were coming. 6 months of empty promises, over a year of working at the company, and people being laid off to save a few extra dollars, I finally had enough and had to quit. As I was leaving, I was asked if I needed more money to stay. Sometimes it's not always about the money, it's about being open and transparent with your employees

Sun Nov 22 2020, Senior Customer Service Representative,"Tulsa, OK",Current Employee ,Stressful,0,"The FINRA and annuities trainers are absolutely wonderful people. Pay is very competitive, and the position will likely be permanently remote in the near future.
","The systems are terrible; we were given about 3 weeks of FINRA training, before we abruptly stopped and transitioned to annuities training (job training) for another 3 weeks. FINRA is difficult and if you don't have experience with studying for school or with finances, look for another job. Customers are almost always mad due to the long hold times. The ""nesting"" period is laughable because you're thrown out to take calls and told ""you're ready"" even when you're really not. Ridiculously high turn around rate and if you have ANY negative financial history (default to loans or owe money) expect to make a payment plan so you can get your FINRA license and keep the job. I really think this should be part of the job description, but oh well. They expect new hires to learn FINRA on their free time in addition to the 8 hours spent watching PowerPoints and learning; if you don't do this, you won't be successful. They offer ""unlimited"" vacation time, but you have to bid for it and it's only allowed based on call volume, which translates to ""good luck using the unlimited time off if you're new.""
Advice to Management
Reconsider the length of job training and how the nesting period is done. Let employees get their FINRA license before transitioning them to job training. Offer more pay if you want to lower the turnaround rate, it's still not enough to entice people to work on their free time.

Even when there were group projects that needed to be completed, they would find excuse after excuse to not do them until eventually one shift finally gives in. Management was never around to fix this problem. The job was also terribly paid and there was literally no incentive to do anything.

Pros
Lot of opportunity with a group of highly competent people willing to collaboratively.
Great environment for a self driven person who can self manage.
Cons
Seeing more and more negative impacts from the segregated management of the DXC mother ship
Complex sales cycles, engagement rules & limitations.
Advice to Management
Stronger commit to a strategic approach that we are vested in and willing to stick with. 
Communications have improved considerably since the old CSC days. This is more focused on ""who we sell to, what we sell and why we sell"" messaging. We are often finding that we are selling and scoping work out of cycle with where the greater DXC focus is.

","Constant rounds of work force reductions (not announced, my estimate around 10 between 2019-2020) and cost cutting (internet, cell phones, bonus plans). Delayed bonus plans and payments. No proper career planning and goal setting. Horrible HR strategy, support and leadership. In my division/practice we had 6 leaders in 2 years (but upper management who puts the wrong ones in place is still there). Because of all that the best (remaining) people are leaving (if DXC did not fire them already because they were not billable for a few weeks), I will too.
Advice to Management
Constant staff reductions are absolutely bad for the morale and is no long term strategy to build the business and attract talent and motivated employees. Instead of 10 rounds of layoffs in 2 years make 1 or 2 which are sufficient. Take care of your people (and do the walk, not just talk). Cannot complain about customer sat if you do not take care of your employees and constantly trying to cut them short, whether is bonus adjustments, late payments or bad health care plans. In my opinion, unless the strategy and culture changes, DXC will keep cutting themselves to a smaller company while keep having the same issues (unhappy employees, best are leaving = unhappy clients).

DXC Technology is way too big and has a bureaucracy that makes it hard to get things done.

Tue Sep 15 2020, Manager,"Tysons Corner, VA",Former Employee ,Dying business,0,"- DXC has some of the best talent in the industry. A storied history of CSC, HPE and EDS means that it was amalgamated some of the industry's best talent. It was a true pleasure to work with many of the people I interfaced with and I learned alot.
- DXC recruited me with a very competitive base salary upfront.
- DXC is great at laying employees off. They aren't so good at deciding who best to layoff (they aren't strategic surgeons...more like cutting off whole leg to treat a few diseased toes...and then cutting off the wrong leg) , but they have the process down and are extremely efficient at this one thing.
","Many cons so please bear with me:
- Executive Management team that is completely out of touch (insulated from the business realities) with what is really needed to move this company into a growth mode (hint: mass lay offs and lack of investment in human capital is your problem not the solution).
- Poor benefits. Some of the most expensive benefits I have seen will quickly offset that great salary. Very poor 401K that only gets a 3% company match deposited once a year means no growth throughout the year and the company can lay you off mid-year and pay you nothing. Healthcare benefits that are not self insured by company, and little company cost share (15 to 20%), means premiums are outrageous you are gouged yearly with increases (with no offsetting raise) by the insurance companies and there is little incentive for the company to keep benefit costs low. It is bad when you could probably do better on a State healthcare exchange. 
- No raises or bonuses. DXC has not provided raises to the majority of its employees in years (I know of some that had not seen a raise in 6+ years), and even though rumors abound like a dangling carrot, there is no real plan to do so (see item 1) or there is always an excuse not cancel a planned raise.
- Heavy micro-management from the Executive team means HEAVY bureaucracy and little can or does get done without executive approval. Line managers are impotent and not empowered. A simple travel request requires CFO approval for a company of 120K+ employees for example. A director, with over 60 reports, has no travel budget or ability to authorize travel.
- Focus on cost containment, and not growth, means the company misses important business opportunities because hires cannot be made in a timely manner and contractors cannot be onboarded in a reasonable time frame. Not uncommon for 6 months to get a purchase requisition approved to bring a contractor on board.
- Over dependence on contractors in general means the company does not have vital intelligence on client needs or how to satisfy client needs.
- Lack of trust between the executive management team and middle managers means nonsensical layoffs or cost cutting occurs without business justification and line manager's buy in. As a manager, you find layoffs occur to the employees you most need and are most productive (the A and B team), while your less effective C, and D team members remain.
- As an employee, your only option is to work in a low cost country where your salary will justify your continued existence with the company. Even though the majority of this company's revenue comes from North America, this company discriminates against workers in higher cost countries (Like the US and Canada), even though many times those workers provide a better value in terms of performance. Qualitative measures are not a factor at all. They will hire 12 non-productive workers in India to replace one productive worker in the US or Canada.

In summary, this is not a services company that invests in its people at all. This is why morale is low and why DXC is continually losing business (and will continue to do so with this management team). It offers competitive salaries to attract candidates, but then does nothing to retain these employees. It has some great talent, but it is hemorrhaging every day. One has to question themselves why many chose to stay with this poorly run company? Many love and are loyal to the old CSC, HPE and EDS is the answer. But that will not sustain them or DXC as the broken present slaps clients and employees brutally in the face on a daily basis.
Advice to Management
MIke Salvino, you are one of the poorest executives I have seen in a long time. You are completely out of your element and making tragic decisions about a company that you know little about (and have taken no time to try to understand). You came into the company with a lot of promise and you ended up letting the legacy executives turn you into the same kind of micro-manager cost cutter that you replaced. Hint: If it did not work for Mike Laurie, might need to try a different strategy. Here is another hint: Get rid of Mike Laurie's executive management team. They did not serve him, almost run the company into the ground, and they are not serving you now. Key is the need to replace the cut cutting micro-manager CFO Paul Saleh. Your HR executive team are also ruining your business and are clueless on managing human ""resources"". You are a services company. Invest in your human capital or you are finished (my sense before I left was that there were no changes coming).

","Over the years as EDS became HP, then HPE and then DXC Technology, employee treatment became much worse. Always the constant threat of being replaced by offshore resources and very little to no salary growth. 
Over the years, as EDS became HP, then HPE, then DXC Technology, this company destroyed itself from within. 

From contacts still on the inside, the most recent CEO seems to have improved employee moral, but having been so low, anything would would probably be perceived as a vast improvement.

We all realize that Share price growth is the rule of law in corporate America these days, your employees are the touchpoint to your clients. We build the trust, the relationships, and the experience that you will never see again after shipping our jobs to the revolving door of often questionable talent that is available for a third of what you paid your on-shore staff. Meanwhile your big deals have disappeared, and your clients merely tolerate the company because they're tied into long term contracts and their equipment sitting in DXC datacenters.

Selling the company divisions is not the solution for the bad company performance. Meg Whitman already did something similar and it did not work. Company buyers, take a look at the middle management if you want better profits for your acquired business.
