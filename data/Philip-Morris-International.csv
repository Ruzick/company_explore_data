Thu Feb 06 2020,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Be Careful,2,"CEO/owner and his executive leadership circa 2013 have stepped back, exited North America or left the company. Low integrity leadership at the time made it aweful at Director level+. Everyone else suffered less but struggled with contant top-down ideas of the day and changes in direction, unreasonable timelines, and pressure to acheive improbable targets with little listening from front line leaders who actually understood the business. New leadership and board structure may have changed this but . . . be careful. Ask tough questions if you're an inbound leader.
","If previous leadership exited or tepped back, especially from North America, there may be few. The business is highly focused and dependent on one category and a handful of cutomers. Its struggling to become a modern multi-channel branded company. So some strategic reservations there. Other than that, nice people there who have fun and find ways to live well beyond work. I mark them low on values because they talk a great talk but they don't walk it. Especially on environmental issues.

","- Old Boy's Club
- VERY Old, staunch, boring company and people- totally against innovation and doing new things. The technology SUCKS
- Very political and conservative- red tape to make even the simplest decisions
- Tobacco industry- I have personally lost a good friend because of my choice in employer
- Highly dysfunctional- There are individuals who have been the company 30+ years who have not evolved past the 80s and have no idea to how to use technology. These people are often at the top of the food chain and rely on you to do all the work for them for them to take credit and present to senior management. A colleague of mine's boss doesn't even write his own emails. 
- Highly individualistic culture where people overlook the basic duties of a job in favor of doing the ""showy"" things so that they can be recognized and promoted, even though they basically failed at their job.

Tue Dec 01 2020, Data Analyst,Lausanne,Current Employee ,Review with real experience,0,"- Phone + laptop if required
- Beautiful workplace at the OC
- Good advantages if you have the PMI contract, not the contracted one
- Car if required
- Sport fitness if open otherwise you go to one in Lausanne
- Salarie if they did not change the amount with all the change
","- Too many delay during the recruitment phase.
- HR are not welcoming, make no real effort in general.
- HR are sometimes friends with people in the workplace area, which is already toxic from the very beginning.
- In the departments I’ve seen, teams do not make any effort into preparing arrival of new employees, criticize them and treat them poorly because they are afraid to lose their jobs and don’t hide it.
- Please MEET the people you will work with if you want to enter the company to make sure they are serious and reliable people. INSIST on that point otherwise don’t take any risks. You will join a team with old employees and you will be on your own.
- All paper and legal requirements documents are neglected by HR. 
- Managers in most of departments are old employees, lost, not enough skills...
- I’ve discussed with a manager who’s having sex with interns. After sleeping with them, The Manager do not extend their contract. They were played, manipulated, gave their body and have to leave. It was the 6x intern the manager was doing it with. Reason The Manager gave is that the personal life is boring @ home so The manager is enjoying time + frustration feeling at PMI
- Men turn around young women easily, I’ve seen an intern where the manager was watching her body and never her face when the intern was talking.. 
- Masculine colleagues turn around the intern and are like, happy watch the «&nbsp;thing&nbsp;». Even if they see that the intern is not comfortable, they have very inappropriate attitude with most of them.
- They are not open to transforming the company because there are basically only old employees, specially HR. How can you transform with old HR ? They fear for their position as well. 
- No clear information and guidance in every process, very messy
- They don’t take ownership in their responsibilities or recognizing true lack of professionalism. 
- I’ve came across the CEO once and he was hiding to not say hi to people coming across him. He was smocking outside, watching the floor and his phone. If I see someone like that as a CEO, I’ll leave because it explains the vibe of the company. 

And the list can go on into my experience to describe how problematic this company is. 

Seriously if you want to enter this company, make your research, check everything in details, don’t think you’re being picky if they complain, and ask everything that goes in your mind. They are hiding so many informations, teams in some departments lies a lot to HR as well so you will only see their true colors when you are stuck with them. So do your homework in details!!

Overall if you want to have a good resume and experience, just go for a short period of time and then go to a more interesting company because this one is falling in pieces. I Think it's like Nokia with the digital era, PMI did not take their chance in modern times.

Grab your meat for a short period term and sell yourself in another company that is doing fine

I also appreciate how the company makes alot of training opportunities - however, I noticed towards my later days that the training opportunity is usually skewed towards high performers. (Since the slot is limited..). There are some amazing senior management who lead by example (though not all). Vision is great, stable overall. Perhaps not a company you'd like to start your career with but maybe a good place to join as a mid-senior. The culture is STRONG. It might fit you, it might not. Some insanely smart people and some very plain people in the same office. It's peculiar. But the long-runners do seem to share a certain character - driven, not too serious about themselves, eloquent, extroverts (atleast, in commercial teams), doesnt mind a bit of politics here and there. Pay was great, at least in my experience.
","Politics. Gossip. Mild to Medium Cut-Throat. But its so obvious so you can steer away from it. :) The cons are not that different from any other company. There will be politicians, free-riders, some incompetent managers and loads of gossip - but PMI is just another big FMCG company with such. Some people stay in this company for decades, which says alot. But sometimes the politics will/could put you off. Just saying, I did see a sub-par sales manager cry at the directors office because she did not get a promotion.
Advice to Management
Please consider bringing back the peer reviews in part of performance reviews! I remember having them at one-point but somewhat disappeared. Though I left the company, I remember that I received the best constructive criticism from them. + ALOT of local P&C people are bullied by senior management (ignoring meeting calls, calling them out for the most random things), which is apparent even to a non-P&C person like me. They bring in alot of good people and help them adjust. It was insanely uncomfortable to watch.

","PMI used to be an excellent place to work, with people who are not only competent, smart and driven but most importantly, led by those who lead with a heart. 
However in recent years, management has become obsessed with cost cutting and earning money at the expense of it's people. The company is doing well despite the pandemic but it is still relentlessly finding all ways and means to be more ""cost efficient"". I understand that all companies are focused on the bottom line but at a time when people are losing their jobs and companies are downsizing due to the impact of Covid, shouldn't PMI, who is still doing well, be more humane when they make their business decisions? Why is the company restructuring and planning to let people go at a time when people cannot afford to lose their jobs? Isn't there a better time to do so? Is it really so business critical? It's disappointing when management claims to care for it's people but behind their backs, they are making decisions that show that all they care about is making even more money.

Wed Feb 26 2020, Project Leader,Kraków,Current Employee ,It used to be much better to work here,1,"The company is very stable and structured. Benefits are great and in most roles provides a good work-life balance. It's great to develop and learn, as they provide lots of training opportunities and the environment is usually challenging.
","The company is going through a big internal transformation (due to their new product/business model) and unfortunately the communication and the change management are super poor. The company closed 2019 with incredibly good earnings, however they keep pushing for global cuts, restructuring everything, launching new global programs, then closing them and changing them, then switching the reporting lines over and over again, cutting benefits (including training and international assignments) and many many other things, all for the sake of ""helping the transformation efforts"". This situation created such an uncertain environment that every week I hear of someone moving to another company and at least every month some senior manager being ""invited to leave"". How do you keep working and focusing on your current role and development when there's zero career path and you are always thinking that you might be the next one on the cut? I'm personally looking for external opportunities...
Advice to Management
If all the constant changes are really needed, you should put your main focus on Change Management, making your best efforts to keep your talents and make them feel safe. I am one of many cases where PMI invested lots of money to train and develop, and it would be such a pity to let people like me go and use those skills somewhere else.

I worked at Philip Morris International full-time for less than a year
Pros
Higher salaries compared to other companies, as nobody wants to work in the tabacco business.
Cons
Inexperienced Management. 
Misleading/Fake role description - I had 3 interviews with Philip Morris, they gave me a fake job description as they did not mention that the role involved standing in a retail shop the entire day, approaching smokers and enrolling them to try IQOS. The management did not mention that the job involved ""educating retailers"" which in reality means bribing them to sell IQOS in exchange for money vouchers, ipads and airpads. When I expressed my concern with doing this and standing in a store the entire day they terminated my contract, so they could cover the company from giving me the wrong job description, making me quit my job and for lying to me.

There is no progression. People I worked with had been in the same role for over 5 years.

The company is not making enough profit from IQOS but only from selling normal cigarettes, in the UK, still killing loads of people around the world.

Compensation used to be good a few years ago, but they clearly did not adjust to the market and now it's just average.
","from one of our recent internal pools: ""I have an impression that PMI only promotes people with so called ""visibility"", people who talk much rather than those actually doing good job."" or ""PMI often promotes people that are only results oriented and lack human qualities"". The constant propaganda barrage they force down your throat is also quite painful to take. My dept. in particular is so quagmired in politics it's not even funny too, not to mention the head of function is commonly acknowledged as a psycho (within and out of the dept - nobody does anything about it ofc).

Tue Jan 21 2020,Anonymous,Singapore,Former Employee ,Join at your own risk,2,"Attractive remuneration package. 
Very competitive environment which can be good for personal growth and a lot learning opportunities if you know how to fight for it.
","Questionable values and morals of the management team - High turnover in the team due to the manager but manager was still promoted even though a few employees have provided their honest feedback of the manager. Also, no support provided by the manager so you're basically very much on your own. 

Unfair hiring practices - Offered higher salary package to rehire a former employee who have taken the redundancy package. The employee has also provided false information on job portal but HR went ahead with the hiring despite knowing. 

Job opportunities to rotate every 2-3 years so people are very eager to showcase new ideas instead of finding solutions/ fixing existing problems - some new ideas are also implemented without thinking about the potential impacts on other departments. 

Very political environment so if you in the good books of certain managers, you will get a better performance ratings.

It is a shame a company, that always focus in having a good behavior with the employes, is trying to set a new office with management that think is able to hide they lack of experience and knowledge by misstreating people.

Good pay ... at the right grades !
Great people bonds when you have the right friends !
","Politics never ends.. don’t come to pmi if you can’t stomach it !

Management never listen or claim to listen ... however stick to their believes and decisions.


Affiliates with negative p&l. Management makes radical decisions (never empathize with employees) and are brutal !

Affiliates with great bottom line. Safety net, great culture and stable environment ! Despite the need to gain more grounds ! 

Extreme man hours preparing perfect scenarios to top management during market visits !! It sucks honestly. Sometime you will feel HQ top management are treated as Gods ! Trust me, they are the most simple beings. A problem with Middle management smh!

At PMI we encourage a healthy flow of communication between management and employees to achieve the best outcome possible.

Advice to Management
Competition amongst the employees is a part of every work space; where a dynamic is created in which employees compete against each other for recognition, remunerations, bonuses, and promotions. The tradition of competitiveness originated from the desire to motivate employees and make them put in more efforts in achieving results. It helped increase both physiological and psychological activation, preparing the body and mind to push boundaries and achieve higher performance. Always engage with the employees and understand the career path in order to drive them for bigger achievements. Avoid employees being too aggressive and workaholic.

We understand there is always room for improvement and as such, our managers receive training to ensure that they are able to communicate and act on our company values. Our emphasis is on a collaborative environment, where people work with colleagues around the world across a range of disciplines to find solutions.

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to leave a review. 
We're glad to hear about your enthusiasm for the professional development that we offer - it is something we focus on a lot, and are very proud of. We are sorry to hear that you're finding it difficult to establish a work-life balance. We introduced a Flexible Work Arrangement program called FLEXability, that gives our people the ability to better adapt to the changing world of work, providing the opportunity to sustain high quality and productivity at work while balancing that with maintaining a happy and fulfilling personal life as well. The possibility to work remotely, compress the working week, work part-time or take an unpaid leave are some of the flexible options now available in many of our affiliates.

Personally, it provided me with a lot of learning opportunities but it was also because I had a great manager who pushed for me. It is a global company, and you have interactions with people from all over the world. There is a lot of stigma and restrictions working in this industry, so it will definitely challenge you and the company works very ethically in its marketing and sales.
","Because of the great perks and benefits, you tend to overlook the fact that it is difficult to advance professional and the great pressures that generally don't lead to any impact on the organization.

Sun Mar 03 2019, Manager,New Delhi,Current Employee ,Great place with some unique challenges,1,"1. True multinational setup, we have many expats in India, most of them bring a lot of International experience, perspective and a no-nonsense approach,, equally local employees do get an opportunity to go outside India on short term(12-18 months) and long term assignments(~36 months)

2. Good pay master, decent benefits

3. Open culture, good global initiatives

4. High visibility and wider scope of roles(smaller org with ~100 people)

5. Good location in Delhi (Aerocity)

6. Excellent and liberal T&E policies, all employees get similar treatment(policies) regardless of designation or grades. >5 hour air travel and you get a business class ticket :)

7. Focus on job rotation and mobility, if you adapt to the culture and are willing to take those extra steps, a very fruitful and monetarily rewarding career awaits you
","1. The type of business that the company operates in (tobacco), and being in wholesale business, puts a lot of restrictions on quality of work. While profiles are wider but most of them are likely to lack depth. For example, your definition of marketing manager in FMCG industry and profile that someone should expect in IPM will be quite different(diluted)

2. Being an MNC, driven mostly by global KPIs and initiatives.. they at times may not make the most business sense from the local affiliate point of view. Someone not coming from an MNC background may find difficult to adapt

3. Some functions may be facing a leadership crisis, while a lot of processes, training, coaching etc goes in, not all SMTs are of same mold.

4. Global mobility is a requirement, if you are unwilling to move out of India, this may become a hindrance once you move up the ladder. Given the smaller team size, moving out of India becomes a necessity after a point, else your career growth will suffer.

","Hollow and cold, with nothing below the surface. No sense of team. Individualism. Zero core values. Management makes no effort to fully integrate their employees. Many employees using alternative tobacco products in offices and meetings with complete disregard for the feelings of others. High turnover due to many short-term assignments - thus difficult to build long term and meaningful relationships at work. The yearly review is badly organized and management doesn't care about their subordinate's career progress.
Advice to Management
Walk the talk and stop the witch hunt mentality when you give the option of an anonymous review and get answers that are difficult to digest. Clean out your upper ranks with old and stale tobacco industry opinions. Let new-hires, whom you recruit to do a specific job actually do what they are hired for, instead of wasting vast sums of money on big San-Fran grab-it-all agencies who keep repeating the same mantra for over one year. If you change your directors and get real leaders from outside the tobacco industry, then you will find that they know how to drive talent and get the best results from them - your existing upper management hasn't got a clue how to really integrate and use people and culture approaches, because they are all stuck in the business from 20-30 years ago... it's really time for change and REAL TRANSFORMATION!

Hi, thank you for taking the time to leave a review. 
We’re sorry that you felt that there was bureaucracy during your time with us. The industry in which we operate calls for a certain amount of frameworks and compliance with regulations, but we strive to give our people the opportunity to do the best work they can, to find innovative solutions to problems and to achieve new levels of personal development.

We are also sad to hear that you felt the workload was too much. Providing our people with the opportunity to balance their workload is something we’re increasingly working towards. The possibility to work remotely, compress the working week, work part-time or take an unpaid leave are some of the flexible options now available in many of our affiliates","Transparency and honesty, corporate culture should be real, support work-life balance of employees

Mon Oct 08 2018, Accounts Receivable Accountant,Cape Town,Current Employee ,Solid Company,0,"Very strong community ties and believes in uplifting various areas. Good benefits and salary is generally above market. Team work is encouraged.
","People are not always rated for salary increases according to job performance but according to how much your supervisor likes you and liking is usually rated whether you are part of the ""click"". Very clicky and not all are welcome here. Team work is encouraged however the supervisors tend to take all the recognition and only offer criticism. A select few are also earmarked for promotions and the rest are forced to either stay in their original roles or forced to resign to ensure their own advancement. I was told that I was not employed for a different job, but I was welcome to look for another job.

Hello, thank you for taking the time to review your

Our senior leaders are responsible for driving our

That’s why we develop our managers to be the people
that you can turn to. Ultimately though, we’re all
working towards the same goal – to do the best work
that we possibly can. Everyone is held to a very high
standard, and this helps us stay ahead.

Hello, thank you for taking the time to review your
interview experience.

We’re sorry that you didn’t feel that you had enough
support. We aim to provide everyone with the tools,
training and experiences to truly excel, to reach and
surpass their career goals.

Our senior leaders are responsible for driving our
business into the future. And this is quite the task!
That’s why we develop our managers to be the people
that you can turn to. Ultimately though, we’re all

A lot of great people working there. Great compensation and benefits, along with assignments in international countries.
","People keep taking credit for others work for the in-topic like transformation. Let’s just say everything about transformation will be accredited To People & Culture (HR).

And there is this class divide between RRP and Conventional. Unless you’re in RRP, you are not even part of the in-crowd.
Advice to Management
The RRP and non-RRP divide is real. And if you’re true about lean startup at enterprise level, stop justifying existing failed projects a using terms like MVP or what not. An MVP is not 2 years or more than 100K.

Hi, thank you for taking the time to share your
experience with us.

We’re sorry that you felt there was misplaced
recognition during your time with us. Your
achievements matter. We believe that excellence
should be recognized, celebrated and rewarded. We
foster a culture of ongoing day to day recognition.

The transformation PMI is going through is happening
throughout the entire organization. From reduced risk
products, conventional business and indeed to all
functions - our smoke-free vision is one that is only
possible through the collective efforts of all our people,
not just management or specific functions.

Hello, thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the benefits
and compensation at PMI.

We’re sorry that you felt there was not enough work for
you in your role.

sometimes things can take time. Often this is just to
ensure that we are compliant with regulations and
frameworks. However, we believe we offer a vibrant
and dynamic work environment, giving our people the
opportunity to make their mark. If you’ve got the

Hi, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. 

We’re sorry to hear that you felt the work environment was bureaucratic. The industry in which we operate calls for a certain amount of frameworks and compliance with regulations, but we strive to give our people the opportunity to do the best work they can, to find innovative solutions to problems and to achieve new levels of personal development. 

Our senior leaders are responsible for driving our business into the future. And this is quite the task! That’s why we develop our managers to be the people that you can turn to. Ultimately though, we’re all working towards the same goal – to do the best work that we possibly can.

Hi there, thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

It’s great to know you are enjoying the work environment at PMI. It’s essential for us to offer a challenging environment to our employees. With a focus on learning and development, we believe in helping our employees discover their potential – and then see where it can take them. It’s rewarding for them, and it produces outstanding results for us.

We’re sorry that you feel that there has been bureaucracy during your time with us. The industry in which we operate calls for a certain amount of frameworks and compliance with regulations, but we strive to give our people the opportunity to do the best work they can, to find innovative solutions to problems and to achieve new levels of personal development",,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

Very ethical. This is something that might sound funny for a tobacco company, but PMI is extremely correct and respectfull with law, competitiveness polices and comitted to being transparent and correct with anything they do.
","Veeeeery stressfull.
Straight taditional style: vertical hierarchy, long hours job, fixed schedule, clock in at the office (even if it doesn't make any sense). If you enjoy startup style, PMI is definetely not for you. There is a global initiative to change this ""manners"", but it is happening very slowly - sometimes it feels like it is not happening at all. It is frustrating for a millenial, because it seems like you're working on the 1980's. 

Last but not least, there is a very strong need of being supported by the right people. There are several cases of people on important/powerfull positions who are not qualified nor prepared to be there. Most of the leaders are like that, and lack of people and managing skills. 

I believe PMI is working hard to change the organizational culture and investing a lot on it. It is also a part of the iQOS ""mindset"", it's innovative. But I highly doubt that PMI will get there soon, or easily. Some people will just not fit, and most of them are considered important assets - and I am afraid they will not leave.

Retire! You guys rocked a few years ago, but things are not like they were and it is clear that most of you are not ready to change. And I am pretty sure you guys are tired anyway... so go. Be happy!
