It is not uncommon to spend time with coworkers outside of work. Work-Life balance is great, you are not forced to work additional time (at least for office work)
","The company has gone downhill over the last 5 years. Emerson use to be Employee's first, and actually care about them. The corporate nature of work has infected the company and employees are treated as a resource, not a person. Over the past 5 years, every year or two there have been early retirement offers and turnovers without filling those positions. A lot of historical knowledge has been lost and doesn't bode well for innovation or future growth. The engineers have been overworked without additional resources, and asking to innovate falls on deaf ears as active projects are #1. Product teams have also been combined without any concerns of the employees and their individual work processes and are basically told to ""deal with it"". This adds more stress to an already frustrated group and has lead to increased turnover. There are power struggles and management politics between teams in the same group that hinder development. The amount of time it takes to complete anything is 4x longer than it should be in the name of ""getting it right"".
Advice to Management
Take a look at the Directors and above and actually see the dynamics between the groups. Some let the engineers do what they are supposed to do, engineer and design things. Others micromanage the employees and make decisions or inhibit productivity. These people also need to retake supervisor training to know how to handle younger generations of people. Most directors and above are ""company men"" and don't know how to handle the younger generations of the workforce. It is very discouraging and frustrating when your entire work group is broken up, moved around, and you don't get to work together anymore, and even forced to sit away from the people you worked with everyday for the sake of forcing you to integrate as part of the new team. Even small considerations that may mean nothing to management mean a lot to your workers.

Tue Dec 22 2020, Engineering Manager,"Saint Louis, MO",Current Employee ,Work Environment Varies Highly,5,"Work environment will vary based on business unit - but some common themes at Emerson are:

1) Directors and above have it made - they are basically given golden handcuffs and often non-transferable skills. Emerson promotes heavily from within (both good and bad?)

2) Some business units are really like a family. That is until financials start to go south, then things can get cold real quick.

3) Decent benefits. Not earth shattering.

4) If you are an average performer or just work to live, you can hide out here pretty well without putting in too much effort. This refers to manager and below level... it changes a bit at director and above.

5) Gradual promotions based on seniority. If you work here long enough you will move up slowly without too much effort.

6) Annual cash bonus tied to business performance at director level and above.

7) Active and generally well supported employee resource groups - minority based mostly
","Again, will vary on business unit, but common themes are:

1) ""Old school"" mentality - Emerson will always be the last to adapt to more progressive work concepts like casual dress code and work from home. Generally lacks in flexibility versus other places to work.

2) Slightly underpays - yes, that big focus on always cost reducing also applies to employee salaries. Emerson will generally be in the 2nd quartile-ish of compensation. Although if you can make yourself indispensable and fight for an increase, you can get it here. You must ask though.

3) The CEO David Farr is basically Donald Trump. Some of you will love this, some of you will hate it. It's just as polarizing here, there is no inbetween. Generally the older 'old school' crowd love it, but younger employees can't stand it. Over time it will become more and more of a liability.

4) Emerson is unabashedly pro-investor (or more accurately, pro wall street investment analyst). This means they will decisively cut jobs when they need to in order to preserve Wall Street expectations of earnings. When the choice is between employees and EPS, they will always choose earnings.

5) Corporate is very directive to the business units. Business unit presidents don't control their own resources or budget, it's directed by corporate only at the suggestion of business unit leaders. Hence it takes a very strong business unit leader to tell the right story and have the courage to stand up for the best decisions at the business unit level. Often this doesn't happen.
Advice to Management
David Farr is a liability. Emerson will become much more appealing to the younger workforce when he retires. When he does retire, make the transition to a more relevant company as quickly as possible. Change is good in this case.

They are a formidable company. The people running the various departments and product are awesome (This is not senior management per se)
","Emerson as whole is very decentralized and scattered around the world, which is frustrating and confusing. For example they have 6 separate office locations in Houston. Technically on paper, St. Louis is the headquarters but parts of the business are ran from several locations (Minnesota , Austin, Colorado, etc.) on the automation solutions side of the business . Lately they have had the business model of acquiring companies and selling divisions off to make money. Every 3 years they run into layoffs because they are at the mercy of global markets and are over leveraged to oil and gas industry, which have seen prices tanking since 2008. They are very top heavy with layers of senior management, and tend to first focus on the finances first and accounting second. The funny part is there is so much extra fat still. The company is slow to move, usually 5 years behind on things. For example in 2020 they just started realizing they had data from all their equipment coming off sensors that they could run analytics and provide services to customers as a value add. This company can design and invent new things from an engineer standpoint, but it is not a pioneer in business, it is a close follower. It disrupts by acquiring or jumping into different markets after they have shown promise and using its power to hit the ground running much Like AB-INBev is today in the beer industry.

This side of the business is overleverage in oil and gas and the products tend to be over engineered which is reflected in there price. Emerson is perceived as expensive with a legacy as a high quality OEM but this doesn't always carry well internationally. Manufacturing around the world, a lot of which is in emerging markets, really doesn't care about your quality because there is no real risk to them if it fails and manual labor is pretty cheap for them, which are two components that your trying to automate out of their process for them. Meanwhile your competition basically is commoditized several of your most valuable product categories with cheaper but comparable products.

Sat Jan 23 2021, Project Engineer,"Saint Louis, MO",Current Employee ,Avoid this company at all costs,4,"Innovation driven, easy-going workplace at times
","· Engineers are highly over-worked and we don’t seem to bring in any new hires to assist in that workload. On top of that, upper management consistently pushes new projects onto the group, knowing full and well that we are overloaded as is.

· Our documentation and record-keeping process needs a complete overhaul. No form is easy to find, no process is easy to grasp, and no procedure is readily available to be understood. I constantly must dig through our drives just to find something. And it is constantly moving around or disappearing without notice. To say that it is a complete waste of precious time to go on a hunt to find these things, is a huge understatement.

· We don’t properly train new hires in the processes and procedures of this company. I am still to this day (after 3yrs), confused about what steps we take in order to get a project completed. I guess I simply need to go digging around our drives for hours on-end until I find the proper procedure document…

· We are not allowed to formally work from home but we are expected to do work from home if we ran out of time during the day which is ridiculous. You can’t have both.

· Morale is extremely low and everyone loves to point fingers or pass the blame without taking any responsibility

· You are expected to automatically know how to run a test, or operate a device, or what have you without ever being formally or properly trained. I guess digging around on the servers for days on end suffices as training.

· Emerson is consistently behind the curve when it comes to progressive work policies that could potentially boost morale. Such as working from home, or a better vacation policy. Seems as though we are still stuck in the 1970s even though nowadays we have Webex or email or internet and a VPN.

· Management doesn’t seem to do anything but pass blame and load on more work for subordinates.

· It doesn’t seem to matter how hard you work here, you will never get recognition for it. But God forbid you slip up and take too long on something, you will make a bad impression forever.

· We love to preach fairness but then pander to particular departments and give them special privileges.

· We constrain our workers so much but then reprimand them when they don’t get enough done with the tight constraints we put on them.

· We pretend to support our people when 28 PEOPLE (I have kept track) have quit, left, or threatened to quit just to receive basic benefits that more and more companies are adopting nowadays. We also tend to lean toward lay-offs when times get tough even though we are a very profitable company and can afford to keep them. Evidently we do not save a dime that we make for those occasions.

· Upper management has evidently adopted a “do as I say, not as I do” policy that they follow to a T. They are allowed to act in certain ways that lower level workers just aren’t.

· When the pandemic was still ramping up, we decided to go back into the office entirely. Whilst other companies in the area decided to work from home until further notice. That really shows me we support our people.

· One of our core values of “continuous improvement” must only apply to making more money for the BU or improving our products because it surely doesn’t apply to our workplace.

· The convoluted and vague job descriptions apparently all translate to “every employee needs to take on the work of 5 people and get it done on-time and correctly or otherwise they will be reprimanded.”

· Speaking of convoluted and vague – we also expect our new hires to jump right in an understand our convoluted and vague process for getting product out the door (as previously touched on).

· We act like we listen to our employees when in fact, all their comments fall on deaf ears. That is, until we see several people leave within a short timeframe.

· The engineering department is evidently responsible for doing the work of several different departments, even though those departments are more than capable of doing their own work. And then WE get chastised if we don’t get that workload completed on-time. It’s as if the engineering department is bottom of the rung in this corporate structure. Everything from above, falls on us to do. And then we get hung out to dry when we can’t complete it all on-time.

· Upper management’s assessment of the productivity of certain individuals is unfair. They tend to focus on what has NOT been accomplished as opposed to what HAS been accomplished. They can even receive a list of items that have been accomplished by individuals, but the issue is, they need to comprehend it. Seeing and comprehending are two totally different issues.

· I do not agree with talent retainment here or promotions. I feel as though we need to re-assess who we promote and who we let go.

· We meet way too often to discuss what we would actually get done had we not been stuck in meetings all day every day.

· It appears as though it is okay for certain individuals to refuse to work, while those that typically work are required to take on more with no say in the matter.

· We waste too much time in training for skills we will NEVER use when we could be using that time training in procedures that would make our day-to-day work less confusing.

· We tend to focus too hard on removing the silo’ing of departments without realizing that when we do that, certain departments will begin taking on more of a workload because there is no clear line as to where one person’s responsibilities stop and another’s begins.

· I will reiterate – OUR PROCEURES AND TYPICAL PROCESS FOR GETTING PRODUCT OUT THE DOOR ARE VAGUE, CONVOLUTED, AND OVERLY-COMPLICATED. Especially considering we do little to no onboarding.

· We tend to say one thing and do another. For instance – core hours are 9a to 3p, but you MUST work 8a to 4:30p however. This is very contradictive and but one of MANY examples of this type of behavior here at Emerson. And in regards to that reference, see the definition of core hours below:

· After all these points, we still sit here and wonder why we continue to lose talent to competitors or other organizations entirely.

· Upper management consistently plays favorites with certain people

· ETC is not usually very accepting as a whole of other people’s styles of learning

· We try to force employees to be someone they aren’t and shun them if they don’t follow that.

· We focus WAY TOO MUCH on customers and shareholders. Employees come last and that is evident in our policies and ""benefits"" (if you want to call them that). And then they sit there and ponder why they have lost talented employee after talented employee.

· Upper management is absolutely clueless and there is zero indication that it will ever improve.

","You are left in the dark till after the fact. One example that comes to mind is strange spending. We got 1 cupcake and a fancy napkin that appeared to cost more than the cupcake for setting a $1BB gross revenue record for the company. It said ""Thanks for a Billion!"". The following morning we were greeted by docile floor managers picking apart irrelevant production situations as if it is the lowest paid employees fault.

Your skillset is not ever rewarded. It is actually ill advised to work harder, learn more, or become a student of their practices and products. The only way to earn more financially is to stay employed longer. The more you do, the more you are expected to pick up the slack of lazy co-workers.
Advice to Management
Speak to floor employees in the same way you would the office. Floor employees get treated like children for an unknown reason and it comes off as extremely condescending.

Instead of focusing on ""hoping"" for a turn around in this challenging (COVID-19) economic time, you should be highly focused on expanding your innovation within fields outside of the oil industry. I have never seen a business thrive through a prayer. It is borderline disgraceful that a company with the reputation of yours to plan business practices off of hope.

All I wanted was a chance to ride on one of David's planes!

Develop paths for all regions to work toward other roles in the company other than management. Right now many other job roles are centralized to a single location in the US. You will lose good people who would like to stay regularly until this improves. Management roles aren't what is desired for everyone.

Advice to Management
As a company, Emerson global is innovating and growing. Their move from Petrochemical to other fields is a great direction for future growth. Most of below is speaking about the Automation Solutions Divisions that rely heavily on the petrochemical industry. They struggle to innovate and need an overhaul. Emerson pulls a lot of new talent from the new grad area, but I feel they struggle to find, or retain new software employees in the 3-7 year experience range. I think this can cause them to lose out on a lot of valuable experience in innovation, as prior to this, most people are still learning, and beyond this, many are already set in their ways.

Mon Mar 09 2020,Anonymous,"Boulder, CO",Current Employee ,Culture depends on different locations,3,"Emerson is a large conglomerate, which means there could be opportunities in other locations and could be a way for you to make a promotional leap. In fact, it's expected as they want you to gain experiences in other roles and environments. 

Culture is strong and respectful. I'm a minority and have felt welcomed in my role. However, there are times where I was the sole presenter for a planning meeting where I wasn't invited to attend in person (I had to present via webex). There were only 6 presenters in a group of 20... which means people were invited who did not present. I'm a minority. Everybody else was white. Why?? I didn't feel this as overt racism and believe Emerson intends well. But they need to be more conscious about things like this, because it affects the under-represented.
","You need to get along with your management team. Many times it seems that people are promoted based on personal preference rather than by performance. This leaves others to feel bitter and question decisions by management about fairness. This can leave a stain on the environment that 'HR team activies"" won't help (I've witnessed 3 years of it at one location... they didn't work so they eventually stopped bothering.)
Advice to Management
One way to ensure the right people are getting promoted is to inquire feedback from other business units about each internal candidate. How your business unit views the performance of an employee may be quite different from how the rest of the organization views that person. This also avoids any personal biases.

Please DIVERSIFY. Why does management continue to put all their chips in the Oil & Gas bucket?? Trying to ride the price-of-oil wave and surviving layoffs every 2 years gets tiring.

","Most of the groups are run poorly. The org structure is heavy on top and you will have several people giving you completely different direction. So much management cost that they are constantly doing layoffs. Constant layoffs lead to employees who don't care about the company and only do the bare minimum, which leads to more inefficiencies. Vicious cycle. Will agree to high level strategy in meetings but then everyone goes back to their respective teams and tells them not to follow that direction. I only experienced the company at the mid-to-senior-level management but I have been told that it is even worse for those below. Extraordinary amount of politics behind the scenes that leads to favoring less qualified people for promotions. Still significant gender bias present in many divisions. Very poorly managed HR - transferring from one division to another is a disaster, taxes as an expat get completely messed up, relocation and compensation promises made and not kept, etc. You need to record every conversation you have in order to prove to them what they promised you.

Fri Aug 23 2019, Engineer,"Houston, TX",Former Employee ,Emerson Daniel: Squandered Potential - Toxic Work Culture,7,"Co-workers are very industrious, kind, and helpful. The Lower level employees of the company genuinely care about bettering the customer service and culture of the company.
","Where to begin?

No work life balance. Salaried employees were pressured to work 10+ hour work days and weekends. There were no boundaries, you could be called by management any day at any time. The company needed more employees due to the high work load but instead squeezed every last minute of work from their employees. You were made to feel guilty for even taking your lunch break. 

Human Resources were often the perpetrators of bad behavior. Managers would use Human Resources to bully employees by having off the books “discussions”. You had no recourse to report inappropriate behavior by Human Resources. You could call the Ethics Hotline, but your complaint would just go right back to your local Human Resources and you would face retaliation. One of the HR personnel would discuss his “relationships” with other employees, which made us extremely uncomfortable. 

Upper management is stuck in a Mad Men style of management. Men being the key word as there were not many female employees, especially in management. Upper managers would often use dog whistle language to threaten your job. No matter how many hours you worked, how perfect your metrics were, you were still made to feel afraid for your job. You could be written up for the smallest infraction (think spelling error). Fear was used to control the employees. So many of my co workers confessed struggles with mental health due to the work environment. 

Customer service is non existent. Perpetually late on orders, it was more likely for an order to be late than to be on time. Long lead times. Enormous quality issues. I cannot stress how many times customers would tell me how much they hated working with us. We were never on time and were even forced to lie to customers about lead times in order to gain their business. Management is will not stick up for the customer and allow orders to continue to be late. We would literally have orders packaged and ready to ship and it would sit there for weeks at a time !

Flow is not making their sales goals so there are currently major layoffs and an exodus of employees. There is no job security and management will tell you to not look for other job opportunities until you have been with the company for 3 years. You are treated as an indentured servant until they decide to lay you off.

Tasks themselves are generally enjoyable, or at least tolerable.

Decent benefits, if you have dependents. (Amazon's are better if you don't.)
","Despite Emerson's corporate values of supporting employees, management's exclusive concern is money money money, including lying to the Sales department about how many units the factory can produce in a normal workweek.\

FY2018 and '19's drive for record sales was done without regard for employee work/life balance -- months straight of maximum overtime has been the rule, rather than the exception. No hiring of a 2nd shift, nor even sufficient effort to hire enough new employees to reach normal staffing levels, just working the production staff to the bone and beyond.

If the supervisor doesn't like you, or you make too many ""complaints"" -- suggestions for improvements, as required by Emerson policy -- you stop getting moved around to new stations for training, and you stop getting your training cards signed off. This results in employees not getting their promised one-year promotion.

Supervisor will ignore blatant violations of rules (turning away from work to talk, not finding a new task upon completion of previous -- and instead just gossiping with coworkers, etc) by her favorite employees -- all of whom are within a decade or so of her own age -- and jump on the slightest hint of 'problems' from hard-working employees, without so much as investigating the reasons.

Wed Apr 03 2019,Anonymous,"Florham Park, NJ",Former Employee ,Marketing Communications Review,1,"401k contribution, yearly bonuses, and friendly people
","The Marketing Communications department is a complete disaster. Upper management is constantly changing the organizational structure and moving employees around to new positions (in which they choose and you have no say) with managers that reside in different states, and sometimes different countries. The responsibilities within the role you interviewed for are not always set. Often times you will find that new employees start and are handling job responsibilities that an admin or intern would typically be working on. So, if you think you are going to be doing the tasks that were written in the job description and what you were told in your interviews, think again. The lack of structure has put a lot of stress on everyone within this department. My role literally changed overnight and my workload increased by 50%, which was never reflected upon in my raises. 

The morale of the department has sunk beneath the ground. It’s sad to see a place that was once enjoyable to work at become a place filled with negativity and miserable employees. The lack of direction from upper management is insane, they can’t seem to agree on anything, and are constantly making shady decisions and withholding important information from their teams. Managers belittle their direct reports daily and micro-manage every task worked on. It also takes a minimum of four people to approve any collateral, which creates major delays on projects due to too many opinions being thrown around. The building was not planned for growth; so many new employees are left without a cubicle for a long period of time. This was once a friendly work environment but has turned toxic. If you want to work at a company that allows you to grow as a professional and pays you well, I suggest you apply elsewhere.

","The company is top heavy to say the least. By that I mean there are too many managers/directors and not enough people actually doing the work. I honestly didn’t know it was possible to have so many managers and directors in one particular group. Everyone wants to drive here. Meetings would often push getting the project completed as fast as possible even if it meant reduced quality. The majority of the time there was clearly a disconnect between what was expected and what was actually a feasible solution to a problem. I walked out of a few meetings with a bad taste in my mouth. 


Pay is lower than average and this negatively impacts the morale of the workplace.

Vacation time is horrible for new employees (<6 years) with just 2 weeks provided per year. Let me re phrase that.. if you want to take a week off of work (5 days) then it will take you 6 months to do so. Your sick time accrues faster than your vacation time for the first 6 years! Of course no one wants you to use the sick time and many questions will be asked if you do. 

Not uncommon for your supervisor to have a completely different degree than you and not have a good grasp on the technical work you’re doing (hard to get promotions this way). 

I felt trapped at this company and felt like I worked to hard in college to just settle for this company. You’ll hear a lot about “up” times and “down” times at this company. Thankfully I’ve never had to experience a down time.

I have been working at Emerson full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Stable, conservative, no big risk taking, fair, ethical, the company is fair and tries to do it's best for its employees
Cons
Good old boys network, can fall out of favor easily, fast track positions are given to select few from corporate, it's nearly impossible to get a P&L role unless your an MBA recruit. If you don't fit the management mold in terms of thinking and presentation you're never going to advance. Make a lot of good looking charts and you'll get promoted - I've rarely seen a closed loop in terms of whether a business manager accomplished what they presented.

Has a really good group of knowledge people to work with
","This review is for the Gulf Coast Engineering Center in Houston. Years ago Emerson was still quite good at investing in engineers, send them to school to learn about the very product they'd use (DeltaV); not any more as most projects these days are 70-80% hours allocated to offshore engineering centers (India, Costa Rica..etc). This is bad because most Houston engineers (except few) no longer know the real ""know-how"" and only have the supervisory roles in terms of making sure projects are on time, within budget, and control project scope changes with clients. If you want to learn DeltaV, this is not the place for you. Better place would be smaller system integrators that actually do the configuration (programming) work within US. This may be just reality as outsourcing is the norm not just within Emerson, but all its automation competitions in the quest to cut costs and maximize margins. Some managers stress to keep ""some"" minor project roles within US but that's too little to make any real dent in cultivating new talents. Career wise, there is no room for upward mobility and growth; it's a flat hierarchy of engineers and above them, PMs and resource managers, no place for anything else.

Work station tend to have lots of issues, either machine tend to breaks down ever few hours, printer not working, loader not loading, forklift worker failed to pick-up ready to ship orders which cause major space shortage in the warehouse area. Also too many hidden assembly instruction that were either not updated in the work instruction or were updated but failed to point out to the co-workers thus causing major product slowdown or rework.
Advice to Management
Please know to update your work instruction if new steps are added and be sure to let all co-workers be aware of those. If a co-worker point out major work slowdown issues due to work station defects or problems, do pay attention and work to find a solution to fix that asap. Don't force co-workers to work using defective work station as those will cause quality issue and add more hiccups to rework.

I worked at Emerson full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Less psychopaths in management since the company only promotes based upon senority instead of ""merit.""
Cons
Not much opportunity for women, LGBQT folks or progressives, in general. Lots of associal, strangely, behaving male engineers work here. The benefits leave much to be desired. I wasn't allowed to take a single vacation day until I worked more than one year. I was told that vacation is only for two weeks and is non-negotiable. I found out that male employees and foreign national employees were allowed to negotiate up to five weeks vacation.

Start paying women salaries comparable to men. Don't base salaries on prior salaries, excluding bonuses when you don't give bonus to non-sales team members. Have more flexibility in regard to the vacation policy.

","Short-term thinking during downturns. Will do anything to keep profitability from dropping without regard for the long-term consequences for the company or employee happiness.

Froze pension in 2015 for young employees, taking away a benefit that they had signed on for, and did not backpay for previous years of service now worth little. This has left most of those affected no longer loyal to Emerson and morale precariously low.

Compensation is below average. Annual increase is limited to 2.5% to 3%. Raises are monetarily insignificant (6% to 9%). Minimal profit sharing in McKinney ($500 per year max). Vacation is only one week for first year even for experienced individuals coming from jobs having 3+ weeks. No extra maternity or paternity leave. Health insurance has high premiums and many common items are not covered. 

Emerson significantly values inexperienced MBA’s for management positions over experienced employees. The large percentage of inexperienced individuals churning through management positions and then quickly moving up has created a host of issues. Emerson places very little value in an employee becoming an expert in a field as compensation is driven by changing positions.

Fri Jan 20 2017, Operations Manager,,Former Employee ,Just another pawn,7,"Emerson had some great employees that do fabulous work. They have great benefits and the savings/retirement program is pretty standard 401k type.
","The upper management does not care about you. This company cares only about the bottom line. Now, I understand that you need to make money and be mindful of that bottom line. However, I was a manager of a shop that was pulling in 3-4 million dollar profits and was let go without any advanced notice. Management will ask you to be 110% involved but will not give you the same respect in return. I even moved across the country only to be used and kicked aside after about a year and a half. This after a major turnaround within the shop itself. Basically, they used me to get what they needed. Upper management took credit for my work and when finished decided they couldn't financially pay my salary due to ""rough business"" conditions.

It makes it very easy when you have children or need time off. The work is very interesting. You don't see the same thing everyday. You keep very busy and your day goes by really fast. Benefits are also very good, just not compensation.
","The company makes bad business decisions that effect the employees of the company. Emerson keeps obtaining ""assets,"" which puts them further in a hole from their goals. That puts more work upon the employees without any kind of extra compensation. Emerson also downsizes their workforce because of those decisions. That makes help and support for daily tasks non-existent. Raises are not determined by effort or production. Regional managers decide how much of a percent you get out of their ""block"" of percentages. So raises are based on favoritism and not production. This company also preaches safety and quality, which is a joke. You'll never receive proper tools or equipment because your manager does not want to spend the money. The regional safety manager copies and pastes presentations from other websites. He also send emails about things that don't pertain to work. The company also preaches ethics, but as long as you're a manager and make your numbers, you will not get fired for stealing (I witnessed this first hand). Emerson is a stepping stone to get to the career you want, not the actual career. This company charges a lot of money for services from truly inexperienced employees. That's because they don't put any kind of effort to keep the good employees around.

As for marketing, there are a handful of people with experience from top companies like Honeywell and Cummins, but they have little influence and are kept in lower level positions within a matrix environment.

He's the type who didn't pay much attention to his job and quickly threw his group under the bus whenever higher management started asking questions. No one ever wondered why he was always putting down his group. The HR person was of the same ilk and was completely ineffective.

Advice to Management
Don't lie, lead on or convince ppl that your company is all about safety when your workers don't care. And don't put little ppl on big jobs and big ppl on little jobs. It's ridiculous and uncalled for, then wonder why ppl quit. Also, the statement made in orientation about safety first, quality second, quantity third... Is and absurd statement, because inside the factory it's all about quantity not quality or safety. Stop lying. You want people to move fast like they're on crack, great place to have that in Lebanon Missouri with all the crack heads. Not all of us are on crack and need a good paying job to survive, what would be good for your billion dollar company to expand your big building to obtain more good workers that care about safety and quality, while still putting out quantity, instead of staying three blocks confined in a field over working ppl.

The people in that group get considered first for promotions, and often get promoted before they are ready, then moved every two years if they want to stay in the running for leadership positions. The practice is self limiting. Without experienced people in critical roles, the leadership and strategic vision are lacking. There is very little continuity in leadership roles. The executive Mba program is little more than indentured servitude. Those employees get promoted, get moved with full relocation packages ($20k and up), then need to sign two- year agreements to stay for 2 years or pay back the packages. Within 2 years they are asked to move again, and are once more indebted for moving expenses. I must say it is creepy. Employees in that program that attend leadership programs are told that they need to have 'trailing spouses' to be successful in the program.

Upper management doesnt know what is the difference between what we can achieve and what we cannot achieve. Continuous unimaginable goals by upper management led to failed product which was delivered to customer.In turn customer ditched the company.

Managers do micro management watching time when employee enters and leaves. Also they were instrumental in who stays and who leaves the company. Personally, I have seen my Ex- Manager made 2 American and 2 Indian guys to resign or laid off.

Every quarter they lay off people , that too hard working people. Only who suck managers balls will get to stay. No promotions , no salary hike but extended hours of working
