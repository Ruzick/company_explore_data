-Flexibility with schedules
","-Digital marketing is a weak point in the NA marketing dept
-Senior leaders are constantly restructuring the dept to fill short term needs with clear lack of long term vision
-Limited investment for foundational marketing staples including website platforms and ad budgets
-Leaders would rather ineffectively outsource digital marketing efforts at large expense than grow talent in-house
-Talent and marketing focus is split far too thin across the various MPG brands
-Collaboration between IT & marketing departments can be slow and simple tasks can take weeks
-No real efforts or budgets for building effective inbound lead gen efforts outside of weak prescriptive campaigns running year after year with little value to show
-Very little digital strategy is executed out of NA marketing, the majority of campaigns are handed down from global marketing, with little thought given to the actual execution
-The North American marketing dept exists to check a box and act as a task rabbit for sales and leadership
-Manpower Group is a sales lead organization, and marketing suffers due to poor knowledge among the leadership in sales of effective modern marketing tactics
-Experts in digital marketing act as educators attempting to guide productive discussions into bringing true value to the organization, vs maintaining the status quo year over year

Terrible mark up's for national accounts with LARGE administrative, time consuming red tape which leads to very low ROI. Staff stressed out as each office only had 2 recruiters working with a 40 associates out threshold that was unobtainable which lead to turnover. Onboarding centralized to include videos detailing how to run a desk. Workers compensation structure bankrupts the P&L of the branches. Closing small town branches which makes a national contract hard to sell for National Sales. Asking Recruiters to do remote recruiting to light industrial candidates that are technology deficient is a giant hurdle. A Market Delivery Lead should be in each territory to help with reporting, recruiter accountability and growth within national accounts.

ManpowerGroup used to be a very good company, but since the previous CEO retired about six years ago the rot has really set in. They are now run by aloof, elite Europeans who have no real affinity with Milwaukee, where the HQ is based. Affable hard-working folks have been culled in favor of hard-nosed ruthless types who will do anything to positively impact the bottom line. It's very sad to see a company that has survived for so many decades, and rode out the great recession admirably compared to numerous Fortune 500 organizations brought to its knees by promoting people to positions of power way beyond their level of competence.

","All consultants beware! If you are working through Manpower at a client, there will be a low touch onboarding process with no direct point of contact to assist in each stage of onboarding. I received numerous emails from multiple sources (recruiters, program mangers, IT, payroll, benefits, etc) prompting me to log in to multiple systems to complete employment paperwork, set up direct deposit, enroll in benefits, and submit time for time spent at the client. Each site required Manpower specific credentials that I was never given (pre and post hire). It is on the onus of the ""person who hired you"" (IT's words) to provide you with your Manpower credentials. Every help desk and recruiter/manager I reached out to was very unwilling to get to the root of the problem; they just pawned me off to the next support team and my tickets kept getting closed without resolution.

","I cannot even begin to describe the amount of disgust I have for this company and the values they 'claim' to have. It is an absolute disgrace. I would love to say some good about Manpower, but it is very difficult. The amount of BS that is in this environment is outrageous, from upper management right down to reception. Nothing but condescending, rude, arrogant people. 
The recruiters are demeaning, management has no clue how to run their teams, and the programs, well let’s say I have received more helpful information watching Sesame Street. 
There is favoritism all over, you just must make sure you keep your recruiter happy or you will never receive work, keep your manager happy or they will find a way to get rid of you. I remember how disgusted I was when I overheard one of the recruiters refer to a client who was going out on assignment as a ‘plug’ really that is the class that these people have? 
Not to mention the ‘clicks’ that exist in this office……mix this in with the gossip that everyone likes to spread (this including management) it is a toxic environment for anyone to be in.
They tell you how great the office culture is, how they are like a big family, how the turnover for office staff is low because of all this. I beg to differ. The office culture is similar to a grade 9 high school with all the clicks and he said she said bs on a daily. They tell you how they like to invest in the current employees they have instead of seeking people from outside, again I call bull. I will tell you how to get hired though, get in good with the CEO, even if you are less than qualified he can get you a position that you will be let go from in 2 months for having no clue what you are doing, long before they look at a qualified internal candidate.
I had the opportunity of working in this toxic environment for a very short time, and I tell you the best thing I got out of the short stay I had was my assignment back out for work. 
Upper management has no idea what is going on, they sit in their offices pretending everything is ok in the office when really it is falling apart. The mid management gossips as much as the gossip between employees, they actually seem to be the start of it a lot of the time. Laughing with the employees about past employees that have been let go, office badgering. Honestly there is a lot of office bullying going on in this business, which is very unfortunate considering that they are there to help people not insult them.
Overall if there is one thing I could do in the end would be to warn anyone who is slightly considering working for Manpower either as a direct employee or as a temp, there are so many other choices out there with companies who would treat you more humanely, I mean it would be hard not too, keep your options open as this is NOT a healthy environment for any normal human being. For those of you who choose to stay, may I suggest some time with a qualified psychologist?

Wed Jun 19 2019, Recruiter,"Troy, OH",Former Employee ,"Unprofessional office, negative environment.",3,"Learning about local companies, learning new industry software.
","I worked for the Troy, Oh office for a short period, around 11 weeks. This is my shortest position, I quit with no notice, for the first time in my career because in that short of a time frame it was obvious this was not the company or environment for me. 
To start, there’s so much training, too much training on how to operate the Manpower system. You forget what you’ve learned because it runs together and you watch video after video for over a week about how to operate the system, I feel like there has to be a simpler more efficient way to teach this. As for training, I felt like I was a total bother most of the time. From my manager who mostly sat at her desk, who would occasionally show me something but typically she didn’t know so she would ask another recruiter to show me and you could feel that they wanted no part of helping me grow. I’m a great recruiter but every company is different and you can’t learn if no one is willing to teach! 
Let’s start with the experience, which they emphasize so much in the training videos.. Jobseekers walk through the door and are hardly greeted, it could be 30 seconds before anyone bothers to acknowledge you, tells you what to do or just says, hi! I know how uncomfortable this is because everyday I’d walk into the office and rarely anyone would say hello or good morning! Like, what is this, I thought we were coworkers, awkward environment! How uncomfortable to walk in the door, hoping to find a job and having numerous people not look up from a computer to acknowledge you. Next, someone, whoever, has them do the next step which is filling out an application on the computer, basically, people are just put in a small room with no explanation and then the doors shut, again giving the impression you don’t want to help them. Now sometimes when people were in this room, staff would talk negatively about the individuals.... So when the individuals are done, they come out and interview. Let’s talk about the interview, I’m big on having more of a conversation, while asking questions and forming opinions. These interviews were a list of questions, I mean literally reading a list, they are generic questions, that get enough info but nobody really took the interview to the next level. There was nothing personable, there was nothing that left people excited, there was no connection and I’m all about the connection so my interviews seemed to aggravate my coworkers as they could be long, detailed and get off topic because we’re human and there’s so much more then reading from a list when it comes to employment. Orientation was the biggest joke, this is mostly done on the computer. A new employee gets almost no interaction with a recruiter to find out any real details. They watch a video and are given a few papers that they sign and out the door they go. New employees need to feel like they have a team behind them, they need you, they have questions, you need this relationship to help ensure the best employment outcome and it’s not there! 
The office was slow, which could get frustrating but gave me time to make spreadsheets and show ways to utilize info.. I made myself a company profile list that had all the info I needed from job descriptions to pay rates, shift times because I needed to learn this stuff and they didn’t have this information updated and available for me... how can you do your job if you don’t know the absolute basics?
 When I took this position I was told to bring all my ideas, which was exciting! None of my ideas ever went anywhere, in-fact other staff disliked my ideas and asked me not to show them to our manager because they didn’t want things to change which was fitting because ideas I showed my manager she seemed none to thrilled, as she didn’t want to change much because the other employees liked things the way they were. I felt like the staff didn’t respect the manager and the manager let the staff have to much control! Rules such as going paperless which were already suppose to be in effect weren’t because the staff didn’t want to, the group seemed happy with how things were, they weren’t open to change and part of why I took this position is because they said they needed that change when I interviewed. I feel like I was tricked, when I interviewed I was very upfront about how I learn, what kind of recruiter I am, what I wanted out of the position... what I was told sounded great but fell very short. 
I’m a great recruiter, I go the extra mile from my interviews, resume building, staying in contact, making goody bags for HR, every time I did anything above you could feel the tension with certain coworkers. All these things combined were annoying but I thought with time it would get better so I dealt with it. Then bonus time came and in front of my coworkers I was told I wouldn’t be receiving anything! I felt humiliated! Not to mention, when I took the position I was told they always hit bonus.... In the few short weeks I worked there I got numerous direct hires, had employees bought out of contracts, filled the hardest openings they had but didn’t receive a bonus and as if that wasn’t annoying enough, I learned this in front of my coworkers. That was it, I didn’t ask my manager any questions, I went home weighed the pros and cons and sent a resignation email. I was asked to complete an exit interview which I agreed to do but I never heard from anyone, I wasn’t surprised.
Advice to Management
Respect your employees! Please read my list of cons and think to yourself, is that how I would want to be treated, then fix the issue. Consider having other offices do exit interviews so you hear real opinions/concerns. 
I sent numerous candidates to other Manpower locations because I felt like they had better opportunities, I feel like this practice should be mandatory as some people get on a waitlist and then disappear because they are kept waiting so long. I think this happens because of the score game you implement people are so afraid they won’t hit their numbers that they store people, they send bad resumes for skilled positions just to hit numbers.. quality over quantity. I think that can get lost when you always have a competition going. I’m a fan of friendly competition and the goals that are set are definitely attainable if you put in the work. 
My petty comment - smoke breaks were ridiculous! I’m not a smoker so i didn’t get to take these ridiculous breaks but these people would take 10 breaks a day! They would take a smoke break 10 minutes before lunch, walk out, smoke, walk back in and then walk back out to lunch... I found this to be really unfair and really unprofessional. It doesn’t look good to have your employees standing right in front of your business smoking.

This caused the company to have to outsource to stay relevant and competitive. Severance was provided, but consideration to employees that were there was not. The company tried to put a positive spin on the outsourcing to India to keep their public image. They cared more about their image than the hundreds of employees they terminated.

Manpower treated me very well in hindsight. My advice to management is to be a bit more clear with your job postings and expectations. Be upfront that, when you first start, all employees in RPO are legally considered contractors with no PTO. There is a high turn around and I think that's due to how your employees expect to get their foot in the door, learn a bit, and seek better prospects.
Despite these cons, I still recommend ManpowerGroup as a solid employer with some exceptional managers.

Tue Aug 21 2018,Anonymous,"Milwaukee, WI",Current Employee ,"Things are changing, for the better.",1,"Like any organization, there are opportunities and challenges. It all depends on your perspective and where your level of interest lies in being part of the solution. Part of being successful in business is having the ability to adapt to change, and even making yourself part of the improvement process where you are able. ManpowerGroup is a large organization with a diverse culture that supports growth and development.
","Because ManpowerGroup is such a large organization, change can take time to implement. New Leadership has come into play within North America during the last year, and the culture is evolving and the level of energy is improving. Previous to this, the organization was in more of a 'cut costs and stop investing in people and technology' stage that really put the company at a disadvantage competitively. Looking forward to seeing the new leadership and strategy changes in action.

Sat Aug 11 2018, Recruitment Specialist,"Milwaukee, WI",Current Employee ,Manpower Review,1,"When I started I had no clue what I was in store for. Being a recent college graduate I was unsure what staffing was all about. I was put on a well known client and was thrown into fire pretty quickly. I am an independent worker and was allowed to find my footing on my own. Once I got the basics of my job I start to take vitual classes that help me learn more aspects of my job better. As the years have gone by I have been able to let my work speak for itself rather than wanting a reward for doing my job. I like getting people to work which is the foundation of what Manpower is about. I do enjoy getting to know my co workers. I like the fact that Headquarters is downtown and is within walking distance of local restaurants amd bars. Leadership knows talent and will take notice.
","I will say that retention is a huge factor in morale due to the fact that people get attached to one another. But then again a lot of people can only see one side of the story so they tend to run with word of mouth rather than getting the facts. Transparency is another issue that would need to be addressed and since I started working there is has but staying consistent is the key. Lots of closed door meetings with only leadership makes people talk and freak out which makes it harder for the seasoned people to convince the new hires that things are going to be okay

Thu Oct 12 2017,Anonymous,"Milwaukee, WI",Current Employee ,Well..,4,"Overall, the people you work with every day are great. Those that do not perform are quickly weeded out and lower/middle management seemw to care about our happiness and improving the work environment/culture. 

The building is nice and there is a covered free parking structure for all MP employees. There are also frequent events held in the building, which increases your opportunities to join causes or network within the community.

There is potential for upward mobility, if you work hard, network and stand out. Degrees, while important for much higher level roles, don't seem to be as critical for some of the entry level positions. They also offer 100% tuition assistance for those that haven't completed their first degree - Which is a huge perk.
","I think your experience with the company is largely dependent on your management team. I've seen people have great managers who develop them and propel them further in their careers, but I've also see the opposite - Managers who do not want you to grow and stifle potential growth. This is a company where networking is key and it truly is who you know, in addition to your merits, that allows you to advance in your career.

Pay is not great and you need to be cautious when advancing as promotional increases seem to be based on what you were making prior to advancement. This leads to a largely increased workload/responsibility and making only pennies (if that) more than some in your previous role. Top talent is lost frequently because of the companies refusal to pay a competitive wage - While I'm sure leadership is living more than comfortably.
Advice to Management
Senior leadership seems far removed and out of touch with the large majority of their employee's needs. Our direction is often unclear even after being stated as decisions are made that contradict that focus. Some great additions have been brought to the leadership team this year, who seem to be in line with where we need to go. I just hope that they don't lose sight of their employees completely, in the process.

I worked at ManpowerGroup full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Clarification: This is a review for working as a perm staff employee for ManpowerGroup, not someone who was placed on an assignment via one of ManpowerGroup's brands (those reviews really need to be weeded out of GD). Also, these reviews need to start having people define which brand they work for and whether they are at the Milwaukee HQ or a branch in the field, since they will be drastically different environments/experiences. Experis and Manpower are your typical staffing models. RPO is recruiting (hence a ton of recruiting reviews and CORE, which is their pay-you-nothing entry-level recruiting initiative). Tapfin handles VMS and Right Management gets paid by dumb companies to consult.

Pros:
- Nice headquarters building with free downtown parking, cafeteria, and Starbucks, as well as amenities within a couple blocks.
- They were good at HQ about letting you work from home. Not surprising as many of the brand employees are very scattered throughout the nation.
- There are some good people there.
Cons
- You are a commodity and nothing more at this place. If people talk about good experiences they've had it is a result of their managers and coworkers, it definitely would not be because of the corporate culture. The COO is a blowhard who you never hear from unless it's to announce yet another brand VP is being let go. In the five years I was there the one constant theme was layoffs in all areas (only slightly offset by the hiring of low wage recruiters in CORE). In the last year they have begun to implement a widespread offshoring strategy, replacing most non-business functions with resources from Indian companies. And while people who lost their jobs to this strategy had to train their replacements to receive their severance, management insulted your intelligence by telling everyone ""This is not offshoring so don't call it that"" And be careful who you say negative things to. While you most certainly can survive being incompetent at your job, being critical of absurd management choices will warrant far greater consequences.

- Dysfunction reigns. This is due to two factors 1) the entire organization operates in their own silos. The different brands might as well be separate corporations, and the few times they have had cross-brand initiatives the execution was a joke. There's a ""we'll figure it out later"" mentality that derives from absurd deadlines, and no one has the time to sit back and figure out better ways of doing things. Workarounds become the standard process. Even within HQ the various departments are on different planets. Finance dictates everything, no one is left in IT, and HR is there to lick the business leaders' boots. Note that they will try to sell you on all the opportunity an organization of such vast size presents, but because no one works together the only way you discover new ""opportunities"" outside your department will be strictly on your own. There are no such things as ""development plans"" no matter how much lip services is paid to them 2) Institutional knowledge dwindles by the day. Layoffs, offshoring, and tons of voluntary turnover have left very few people around who know why things are as messed up as they are. In addition, the headcount reductions did not come with a reduction of workload, so the people left got more of the work, it was done faster/more poorly, or it no longer got done at all. This will only get worse as the latest phase of offshoring takes place.

- Leadership is a mess. The largest brand Manpower has had three SVPs in the last five years and Experis just canned theirs. A couple years ago the COO thought it would be a genius move to have global SVP's ""double-hat"" and also take over North America, stretching them to the limit and creating even more chaos.

- They are super cheap when it comes to their technology and systems. They will have several disparate systems where a large all-in-one enterprise system should be in place, and none of them will interface with each other. This leads to all sorts of inefficiencies and manual processes (and then leadership will turn around and use that as an excuse for offshoring when their own cheapness/ignorance is the cause). The brands themselves are all on totally different platforms. God only knows how finance ties it all together. Again, this is another issue with will not get any better as the IT department has been decimated.

Create an efficient process to help your recruiters. The fact that the main focus is in the placements and not the quality of the placements or the jobs is alarming. I would not be proud that you are #1 in redeployment when all you are doing is sending associates from one crap job to another and constantly backfilling because of the lack of quality.

Wed Mar 29 2017,Anonymous,,Current Employee ,Changing for the worse since original owners death,2,"Flexible and nice people to work with
","Since the originals owners death the culture and values of the company have changes significantly. After getting a new CFO, Darryl Green, many changes have been being made and employees have been kept in the dark and in some instances lied to. Darryl Green used to be the CFO of Tata and now ManpowerGroup is shipping a large quantity of jobs overseas to India. In their press release this last month they said 150 were terminated due to process improvements. It is seems suspicious and odd that the CFO of this outsourced company has pushed to hard to give his old company all of the business, odd no one is questioning if there is a conflict of interest there with that vendor. Also, no significant process improvements or software upgrades are occurring, they are simply having the employees being terminated teach their jobs to overseas India workers to do them for a third of the cost, by saying automations are occurring they are trying to hide and down play the outsourcing. They implemented Phase 1 of the transition last year and lied and told employees that there would be no Phase 2. Phase 2 began in March 2017 and now they are telling employees there will be no Phase 3 even though some employees have been told even though they aren't being terminated now they can't ensure they will have jobs for more than a year and are starting to have people not be terminated show and explain their jobs to Tata. It really has not been a transparent process for employees being impacted and difficult questions are dodged as much as possible by management. Would not recommend due to the instability of being able to keep a job.
Advice to Management
Be honest with your employees. Practice what you preach, if you are here to give people jobs than make actual automations to cut costs and keep jobs in the U.S. for people. With true automations to cut costs, yes some employees will not have jobs, but less terminations would have to occur. Also, if you aren't treating employees poorly and not doing anything wrong then why do your media releases say you are automating and not honestly saying you are outsourcing?

","-Low pay. This is taking a toll on not only employees, but the company. You get what you pay for, and hiring inexperienced people because they will work for lower pay does not equate to awesome results. This experience is worth something, it should be rewarded.
-Decline in book of business: I don't when/how the sales and account teams decided it was ok to take on such low margin business and attracting such difficult candidates, but typically you need to make a PROFIT to stay in business, correct?
-Limited growth. Sad but very true, a manager can hold someone back because they don't want to replace a good employee, as it's getting harder for them to find employees at that pay rate. There are few options for growth anyway. Branch managers are also pretty much incentivized to give low pay and unfair reviews--if they have to give a positive review/pay, that's less bonus for the manager. Seems kind of shady to me.
-Inadequate resources. The phone systems are unmanageable, too tight-fisted to hire sorely needed admin help. The ""support centers"" (payroll centers, account support at HQ, etc.) are not held accountable, don't communicate with each other, so when serious errors occur and we have screaming clients/temps as a result of it, HQ's response is ""whoops""--and then their inefficiencies double our workload.
-The U.S. operations just do not seem to be a priority to give the proper attention and resources. Most of the money is made in Europe, so that's why it seems the local operations are an ""afterthought""
-Outrageously outdated technology, this is leading competitors to pretty much make it no competition.

Tue Mar 29 2016, Staffing Specialist,,Current Employee ,Staffing Specialist- why not just call it what it is: recruiter?,0,"Good benefits. Plenty of corporate resources to assist staff employees in performing their job. Pretty quick responses to questions/issues that arise. Business model is good in theory
","Disconnected upper management with no understanding of the workload that is placed on employees, especially in smaller offices. Claim to be workforce experts and connecting people with meaningful work but that is all nonsense since a culture of ""turn and burn"" is what really matters. Nat'l sales and client relations are nothing but ""yes men"", with little to no consultative relationship with clients- tell 'em what they want to hear and place the burden on your staff. Hired as a recruiter but 90% of my position has to focus on admin work b/c there is no clearance from corporate or leadership to bring on an admin worker. Now they push people in my position essentially being salesman as well. So what is the branch manager and sales team for? BM's are supposed to be bringing in new business, and mine is ""in the field"" 30 hrs/week with new business rarely coming in. Instead of finding a good salesman or figuring out why the BM isn't bringing in new business, they simply put it off on me? National contracts are a joke with razor thin margins (if that) who get to hire workers for free after 90 days, so my temp-perm conversions are not recognized. Contracts are pretty much stacked against the staffing specialists. Inadequate training is another issue as well as having no clear path or vision for advancement within company. This could be because of small office, but I've heard colleagues in larger offices in metro areas with the same complaints. Bill rates are high, but we're encouraged to take on any person that enters office; how can we then demand a higher price when we accept everybody? There is a lot of unclear/conflicting information mandated by leadership. Probably because they are w-e-a-k!
Advice to Management
Understand what all staff employees do at the local level. So many corporate policies or directives are counter to actually running the business smoothly. We can't drive orders/business when MP demands premium bill rates for average workers. Stop with the ""own this, own that"" nonsense- we do own our careers, own your corporate/management decisions. When it comes down to someone accepting blame for a short-coming, management/leadership sure don't ""own"" that. Not much appreciation shown to us except lip service and talk is cheap. Leadership doesn't share in cuts or the workload that is daily dumped on the local offices. For instance a certain regional VP gets to go to Costa Rica on MP's dime despite the fact that that VP's region saw overall decrease in sales and revenue. Sure doesn't sound like a top performer to me, so why does the VP get to go on this big vacation meant for top earners in the company? That doesn't look good to a nuts-and-bolts staff employee like myself. It further shows a disconnect between upper management and the workload of local offices. Stop talking a big game about improvements to the experience and service delivery and actually do something about it. Innovation is feared here and eventually the CEO/COO and shareholders need to start holding leadership accountable.

Stop consolidating departments under one manager ""double hat"".

Thu Aug 20 2015,Anonymous,"Milwaukee, WI",Former Employee ,Worst Professional Experience Ever,2,"It was a paycheck and that was all it was.
","This was by far the worst professional experience of my life. ManpowerGroup is a very poor employer.

There is absolutely no career development. The company requires you to fill out performance development plans every year along with answering questions about your life goals and where you want to be and what you want to do. They basically expect you to be in the same role forever.

Their performance development plans are pointless. It’s the same process ever year with absolutely no perceived benefit to the employee. It only benefits the company because if you can’t meet every single lofty expectation, which is usually quite the challenge, it is used as the basis as another excuse for not being able to provide a compensation increase. 

There are no such things as promotions, at least that I witnessed in 10 plus years. The only people that seem to move from position to position are the executive staff. Quite frequently, the company will hire from outside before supporting the development of its internal employees.

The company thinks that a year-end increase of is a “bonus.” I guess they’re not aware of something called inflation. They’re a $20.8 Billion dollar company and they can’t afford to provide bonus incentives. 

They make very poor choices in management figures. In many instances, management figures are condescending and rude. In my own experience I experienced a manager question whether I had Alzheimers because of an email that I sent that she found confusing. That is not a joke.

Most if not all company employment policies are geared towards the benefit of the company. You cannot roll over vacation. No bonuses. In many instances, you have to schedule your vacation months in advance. If you read the employee handbook, it’s apparent that ManpowerGroup has carefully thought out each policy in order to make sure the company benefits in the end while the employee sees little benefit.

Finally, if you care about a work/life balance, then this is not the place for you. There is zero work/life balance…..it’s only work. They’re expectation of 50--60 hours a week on a consistent basis (in my case over 4-5 years) is absurd. In my opinion after more than a decade, it seemed as though the company was trying to take over my life. 10-12 hour days and most weekends. Just not worth it. Life it too short.

Company leadership: stop going to your direct reports for feedback from the field. Instead, go to the field employees themselves. Also, realize that saving a buck or two by outsourcing a lot of the functions not only ruins employees' confidence in the organization, but doesn't save anything in the end, as the outsource providers don't know the brands, procedures, or company politics like those of us inside the company. It's beyond frustrating. And outsourcing the IT department and internal help desk to India? One of the worst ideas ever. YOU try to get help from them and see how it goes. Good luck.

","Management plays favoritism and there is definitely ""white"" privilege in the workplace. Just look at management, there is only one African American manager, everyone else is a white male or female. This lack of diversity in management makes it very difficult for current recruiters to advance as they are often pitted against their white counterparts. I personally have witnessed some less senior recruiters get away with constantly being late to work and being promoted to staff or other recruiters who struggle with meeting their goals or number of people submitted be promoted simply because they asked over and over. The turnover here is extremely high as it is very rare that the people you start with will be there in 6 months. They have this career path that is set up for you but if you are not a top performer, some managers will hold you back from completing your training thus making it impossible for you to advance and receive an increase in pay. Speaking of opportunities for advancement, don't you dare try to look for other opportunities in the company because to your face your manager may tell you to go ahead but behind your back they will do everything they can to make sure you do not leave their client. I understand wanting to keep good people on your team, but people also want to grow and explore other opportunities. Overall, my biggest issues were with management from the top all the way down to the one I worked with closely. Unless you are one of their favorites, they will walk past you as if you are nothing. I think management can definitely undergo some training on how to effectively communicate with their teams and how to treat their staff. It is not what you say, but how you say it.

Take the time to properly train your staff before they start a new pod which will likely decrease turn over rates and promote a positive experience. Nothing is worse than sitting in a day of training and the next day you are expected to work on a project with little to no training. Also, value your employees who have been there a while with a simple great job or I can see your hard work as that type of recognition can go a long way. Lastly, what you do for one employee you should be willing to do for others: good and bad.

It's a rapid and dynamic industry as well.
","The main con is their off-shore IT obsession. They constantly try to move things off-shore and then pull back some when it fails. Most of the company accepts it and works around the sub-par help desk and IT support as a result. However, other managers get frustrated and escalate to IT management who then force the on-shore IT staff to cater to the managers at the expense of their regular duties. If your management doesn't like the work of the off-shore resources, then don't use that model or at least tell those managers to stop complaining about IT spend.

Stop with the off-shoring. You are a staffing firm, figure out how to be more efficient instead of just moving bad processes off-shore.

","The “team-oriented”’work environment is really just run by whether the favourite team leads like you, extreme favouritism amongst the workers, CEO has a “I just worked hard and pulled up my bootstraps” mentality, and the company has very little regard for the mental health of employees, bait and switch hiring, high and unclear expectations without providing the necessary resources, higher-ups will just take the company favourites’ word over facts of a situation, very cliquey environment with lots of office gossip and bullying and bad-mouthing contract workers, no HR team because the higher-ups believe they are the HR team.

The company is very money-driven with little regard for workers and employees. The office culture resembles one of a high school cafeteria. CEO encourages you to brand yourself as ""Manpower"" by having your entire professional social media be decked out in the logo. You're also going to be asked to sign a waiver that implies that if you go against the company at all, out them in any way, you could potentially lose your job.

Upper management gossips and tries their best to get away with ripping people off except for their chosen favorites, and accepts workplace bullying.

over 100 people leave the company each year and are quickly replaced by others

- according to people who have access to this info you get a salary of about 4-5 times lower than any manager and if you ask for a better computer or anything else you are shown the door. We work on computers from 6-7 years ago which barely function

- the managers are the only happy people in this company, they give themselves bonuses each month and congratulate each other whenever they can hire someone on the lowest salary possible. 

- in Manpower Romania there is nobody you can ask for any help unless you want to try your chances at getting fired. recently 10 employees in the financial department were fired for asking about their annual bonuses which are mandatory in their work contracts.

Mon Mar 27 2017,Anonymous,"Dublin, Dublin",Former Employee ,Awful culture,0,"Can't really think of any pros. The working hours was okay I guess and there wasn't a lot of overtime.
","Where to even begin ...

I've held several positions in different teams in IBM in Ballycoolin, and the griefs listed below I've all experienced personally.
These are not the result of one rotten apple destroying the morale and work environment in one team, this is the result of the mentality of HR and the management as a whole.

I began as a service desk agent at the helpdesk. I did an interview and didn't hear anything for months afterwards. Then suddenly out of the blue I was contacted and Manpower expected me to be able to start a week later. I was moving to Ireland from another country and had informed them that I had to be given a heads up at least one month in advance, but they didn't care.

Working at the helpdesk I was expected to magically know how to resolve issues without being given any training in advance. I was put on the line for specific issues/programs without being told, and if I was to receive any training I so desperately needed I first had to screw up so badly the team leader was forced to let me shadow with someone.

Breaks were not something I was entitled to. Officially you have one break in the morning and one in the afternoon at 15 min each + a half hour lunch, but management will find a way to rob you of those if they can get away with it. 
I was called into a meeting with my manager and team lead, because I had gone on breaks and lunch when my team mates were out on their smoking breaks. I was told I could only go when no one else was away. So I frequently had to go the entire day, 8.5 hours, without lunch or a single break. 
Let me repeat: I had to sit at my desk and take calls, covering for my team mates who were away all the time on smoking breaks, the entire day straight, without eating or drinking. When I finally was off in the afternoon I felt dizzy and ill. 
Again, Manpower and the management couldn't care less.

There is no room for career growth unless you are chummy with the right people. To be given more responsibility and a chance to prove yourself mainly rests on if your team lead likes you or not. If they don't, you're stuck.
In the last team I was a part of before I got out of there this was especially apparent.
The person HR and the manager had chosen to be team lead had no previous experience in this role. They would constantly yell at the team members they didn't like if we dared to ask a question about how to perform a task. At the same time they would give the more interesting and rewarding roles to their pets in the team. 
I had to find out on my own how to do my job, and whenever I did a mistake, which was bound to happen when I had no one to guide me, it was all my fault.
There was no point going to the manager or HR. They would defend the team lead and when the quality of the work plummeted because we were virtually without any leader, they blamed it on the agents. 
I was called into several meetings with the team lead and HR because the quality of my work was not ""strong enough"" and I didn't resolve enough tickets. 
When I pointed out this was because of the fact there was no one to teach me, it was thrown back at me that I was supposed to know the procedures by now. I was then threatened with disciplinary and PIP. It was never, never the fault of the management. 

The thing about the management is this: They won't do anything about a toxic working environment unless they are forced to. They appoint people to team leads who they deem ""deserves"" it, usually only because they've been with IBM for a long time, not because they are suited to the position in any way. 
When it becomes obvious this person doesn't posses the qualifications for such a role, instead of removing this person and apologize for their mistake, they defend and empower the person and let the rest of the team suffer for it. 
Not until it becomes obvious to the higher ups in the organisation and the client starts to ask questions will they do something about it. And only because they personally might get in trouble.

To put some numbers into this: In the final team I was a part of, just in the first couple of months, at one point 8 people quit in 8 weeks. The trickle of people leaving because of the team lead and lack of responsibility from the management continued steadily. When I at last got out I was the 4th person to leave in a 5 weeks period. 

So to sum it up: 
In IBM Ballycoolin, Dublin the team leaders can bully, demean and intimidate employees with the approval of HR and the managers. 
Instead of losing their jobs they are empowered and promoted, while intelligent, hard working employees leave the moment another opportunity presents itself elsewhere.

IBM in Ballycoolin is a place you want to avoid at all cost. I would give this place 0 stars if I could. This place destroys your spirit and makes you lose faith in humanity. Stay away!
Advice to Management
Start taking responsibility. It is very obvious to the agents that you don't care about the work environment or the quality of the work being performed. Unless your superiors starts asking questions, of course. Then you are all of a sudden the most caring people in the world.

Quality begins at the top. When the agents sees you don't care, why should they? The quality can't be that important when you leave them to fend for themselves and never provide any training. 

Clean up your act. The abuse you dish out will come back and bite you. Some day someone is going to slap you with a lawsuit. From the outside it seems like you're trying to have this place closed down.
