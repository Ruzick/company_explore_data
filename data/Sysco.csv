","Leadership style is very toxic and driven by fear. “Do it because I said so” Turnover is probably the highest of any fortune 100 company. Sysco furloughed 30% of the workforce only to now be actively recruiting on job sites and continuing the employee revolving door. Senior management decided to eliminate local customer service and by doing so have made a lot of customers upset. The attitude is that the customers need Sysco more then Sysco needs the customers.

I worked at Sysco full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Sysco openly advertises giving away over $100 million in groceries. Yay... Great training. Comes in handy no matter what company you work at. Had a great career here until Covid made employment feel unbearable.
Cons
Was full time for several years. Company seems focused on giving away groceries instead of selling them. Just look at the LinkedIn page to form own opinion. 

It feels like you are a number here. It felt like skills were exploited for the benefit of the corporate executive management. Local management seems to care for you, but they seem powerless to help you. But that is just an opinion... no work/family life balance. Work 50-70 hours a week and very little return on investment compared to other companies.

","On the fly changes, less pay than ever before, management is only looking out for themselves
Advice to Management
I will say I know most companies have had to adjust due to Covid and some of those changes will not work in employees favor. The brand Sysco is not what it used to be. We used to stand out as the best in the business. You got what you paid for with Sysco, products were pristine and the top of the line and trucks showed up with all of your products. Now the sales team is buried with micromanaged agendas and forms to fill out. I understand the programs to monitor and encourage growth but it’s no longer about that. Now before we sell a case of mayo to a customer we have to explain why we want to sell it, how we are going to sell it, what pushed the customer to purchase it and then rinse and repeat. This is no longer about selling groceries but a job is where corporate wants to know what you are doing every second of your day. They have cut everyone’s salary and expect even more now than they ever have. I opened a 10k a week customer and due to new pay structure I did not qualify for a bonus and was unable to make any extra commissions from the sales. I have sold this customer 150k or so worth of product and have yet to receive an extra penny for any of it. Our phones do not stop ringing with problems that include their trucks are 3 hours late, they cannot get what the order and more importantly, we are WAY more expensive than any other vendor and the quality does not justify it. All of the apps that Sysco has rolled out has had tons of problems, at times before cutoff programs will not work so you are forced to call into a 1800 number to where they are overloaded with work and you will wait 30 minutes on the phone. Of all the coworkers I speak with, we ALL HATE our jobs, it’s miserable waking up and going into work and almost all of us have began to look for new jobs. The sales rep is the glue that holds that customer to Sysco in most cases and I can guarantee you that you will be losing customers soon as a mass exodus from Sysco I will begin soon.

Thu Oct 08 2020, Project Manager,"Houston, TX",Current Employee ,Frustrating good old boy company pretending to be innovative and inclusive,0,"A few of the people I work with are nice. When I first started it was fine but it quickly went downhill and continues downward every single day.
","Pay and benefits are not competitive

Leaders have terrible leadership skills (incompetent, bullying, title snobs, ignore your input, take credit for your ideas, etc.)

Disorganized, confusing, and contradictory policies and procedures

Poor technology

Every department is under staffed and has no budget so everyone is overworked, stressed, and burnt out

Lots of lip service from leaders (don't be fooled by the public statements and social media posts about the diversity efforts - it's all middle aged white men calling the shots; they tell you to take time off and take care of your mental health but load you down with an unreasonable amount of work that means long hours, working on days off, or not being able to use vacation days, which you don't have the option of getting paid out)

HR is nothing but toxic office politics and making excuses for bullies throughout the organization 

Senior leaders are very out of touch with what's really going on in the company - even if multiple people try to tell them, they ignore it or get offended and blow you off

Very male-dominated company. Yes, many women work here but they aren't promoted (unless they're bullies), they're under paid, and they're ignored. I see a lot of turnover with the women I've worked with here

I could go on and on. I've been here for over five years. I know multiple people that are exhausted, miserable, and looking to get out.

Working from home helps with work/life balance. Please continue with this model after Covid. Most employees would be happy with a day or two in the office, and WFH the rest of the week.

Sun Aug 30 2020, Marketing Associate,"Milwaukee, WI",Former Employee ,Clown Show,2,"Pay WAS good, previous commision structure was lucrative IF you knew how to sell.
I was already used to the 7 day a week on-call environment that comes with foodservice, the long hours, the unreasonable and intrusive micromanagement, the abusive alcoholic chefs and customers, and the unwillingness of many customers to pay for long digested and forgotten food. My previous 30 plus years in this industry had made me well accustomed to that.
","Until I started reading the hundreds of negative reviews from current and former salespeople, I thought the nonsense I witnessed and experienced was mostly local, Now I know it's national. Let's get started:
I was recruited from a competitor. After my no compete expired, I was able to bring over a couple of million in business to Sysco. Now that I was let go because of Covid (more on that lie later), those customers are now off-limits to me at a new job, if I could get one. There is a pattern of bringing on reps from competing firms and then divvying up the spoils amongst their favorite MA's when those reps are shoved out.
The Three Stooges could be a more effective leadership team. There is ZERO leadership. Opco management just rolls the corporate dictums downhill, no matter how out of touch and stupid they are. Their days are spent knitting butt covers for themselves, and micromanaging the sales team through 360 (salesforce). They care more about process than results. If you sat on your laptop entering garbage about what you supposedly did, and where you went, that was more important than actually creating results.
Favoritism: Lots of it. There was a nucleus of employees who had survived the various coups over the years, and they do very well being handed the accounts that are taken from those who leave. I had 5 route splits in 2 years, with the easiest to service, high margin accounts given to underperforming (but buddy/buddy with manager) reps benefitting. I was given the accounts that were bungled and manhandled by others along with the negative history constantly.
Despite all these negatives, because I have over 30 years experience in this field, I was able to overcome these hurdles, and actually made ""Chairman's Club"", a supposed honor at Sysco. Less than 6 months later, when the shamdemic came along, that piece of paper came in handy during the TP shortage! I made the company over 850k in profit-dollars, and I was kicked to the curb. I wasn't on a plan, had no discipline issues, but I am over 60, and I made too much money for the new pay plan... They fired us on a surprise video call en masse, and then just like Mission Impossible, my laptop went dead. In order to get the severance package, we had to sign off that there was no age discrimination (there OBVIOUSLY was) and had this not been such a financial shock, I would have retained a lawyer.
I could keep going, but the last thing is something their stock holders should be aware of. Their pricing is literally crooked. Unless a rep manages avery single price every week, the ""system"" will jab a customer with 70 dollars a box on potatoes that should be 20. You are trained and encouraged to participate in shady schemes like changing prices by switching numbers around. No matter how high your margins are, it's never enough, until a customer catches you, and then the clowns in management go to the customer, hat in hand, blaming the rep, and transferring the account, all to start the rip-off all over. The internal ""pads"" are the highest I've ever seen in my long career, as much as 40% on sysco branded items, even commodities that all come from the same sources. We were always 2 steps behind the market when prices dropped, and raised them ahead of the actual increases. I had to spend more time defending the company's nonsense than selling. You also have to compete with all your co-workers for new business. I've never seen anything like it. Literally dog eat dog, with the favorite lap dogs usually winning with management help. I had numerous prospects taken away after weeks or months of work and given to their pets.

You get compensated very poorly and given bonus information late, so that you don't make it. There is always a reason why they don't promote from within, pay you your bonus, or give you a raise. Unless you are the best in the industry you won't get paid or treated right here.

2. Order of things make no sense whatsoever. Territories are not protected, reps from other districts have accounts in yours. 
3. In order to take time off, you must get another rep to handle your accounts at no pay.
4. You're expected to work Sundays and Holidays if needed.
5. Computer process is overbearing and complicating...doesn't need to be
6. Too much nit-picking....""you had a great week, but why didn't you sell any broccoli?""
7. Job requires heavy traveling....company does not pay mileage
8. When starting out, the current reps get to get rid of their 'crap' and you
 get stuck with making the best of it.
9. Sales meetings every Friday...way too many

Thu Feb 13 2020, Business Technology Analyst,"Cleveland, OH",Former Employee ,Everybody is Watching you,0,"Free Parking. and Few cool people in the office.
","1. The Financial person is a weirdo and never approve anything on time. Be careful. People are watching you in the office and then call your supervisor.
2. Not 1 person job. The last 3 techs left this company in 10 or 11 months. and if you ask this question, they will tell you this ""The last tech never said NO, and they got overwhelmed."" They say that all the time but is no true.
3. At least my manager played favoritism. I completed more than 5 long projects and never received employee on the month, however, if one of his favorite tech install anything or travel somewhere they get employee of the month.
4. Prepared to work on multiples projects without a warning.
5. Old hardware with lack of space. When I started it was only 100GB now is 200GB.
6. Printers are truly a mess.
7. Devices in operations are full of dust, you will get sick guarantee.
8. Tickets in ServiceNow are a joke. Nobody works on those. Only tier 1 and the tech on site.
9. Prepare to take 3 and 4 meetings per day. Useless, not related to your job, but is mandatory because you are the new person.

I can say more awful that happened to me when I was there but go and see for yourself. I could say that 60% of the people there are not professional at all.

We are committed to creating an open, diverse, and respectful environment and take feedback from our current and former associates very seriously.

There are many options at Sysco for providing feedback including anonymous methods such as the SyscoSpeaks Associate Engagement Survey and the Sysco Ethics Line. Again, we are sorry to learn that your experience with Sysco was disappointing.

Met a few good people.
","This list could go on and on. The pay was subpar (sales) and commissions are a joke. Seriously. They complicate the pay structure so the sales team doesn't realize how much they're being ripped off. The management is like a group of guys that graduated from clown college. The managers professionalism is that of a snake oil salesmen. Restaurants need food, Sysco sells it. It should be that simple, but they convolute the process with unnecessary micromanagement. The encouragement to lie to customers is strong within the 4 walls of Sysco.
 IF you drink the cult Kool-Aid that Sysco feeds their zombified sales veterans, you have a chance at staying in their prison-job. If you make it clear how idiotic their ideas are, you put a bullseye on your back. The management expects the saleswomen to sleep with them, which makes the monthly sales meetings very awkward. 
 Once I realized how little the DSMs make, (District Sales Managers), I realized this is pennies compared to other industries. Save yourself the time and frustration and look at other employment opportunities. Serious sales professionals will be miserable with Sysco. 

Actual sales talent among the whole sales team in West Texas is almost non-existent. Their ""training"" isn't to better their sales team. The training is just mindless preaching and knock-off TED talks. I met maybe 3 REAL sales professionals among the group.
Best decision I made was to take my leave. Wasted good time. If I could've rated a 0☆, I would've.

","Sysco has taken a lot of the ability to make a good living by pricing themselves out of the market in a lot of areas. Very hard to commission and the bonus part is based on a percentage of what you commission. So if your commission is low, bonus becomes not a value. Sysco is systematically stripping the salesperson of the ability to make good money. What was once a family oriented company has become a company that does not care about their employees anymore. Very disheartening and sad.

Wed Mar 20 2019, Marketing Associate,"Detroit, MI",Former Employee ,STAY AWAY; Very unprofessional and highly discriminatory organization,1,"Fortune 100 status and decent benefits. High standards for their products are also impressive. Good training program when you have competent people to implement such when onboarding. Great career potential for those starting out early career.
","Two of the OpCos I dealt with were VERY problematic. There are a group of highly uneducated, ignorant, and unprofessional people in leadership who think that discriminating against women, insulting candidates, putting employees at safety risks (and your leadership laughs about them), and manipulating situations to get what they want are ""good ideas"" and there are no consequences for such. If you are fresh out of college or a kitchen and have limited to no corporate work experience, come here because you probably don't know any better. If you are a well-educated, intelligent, and self-respecting human being, you'll find out quickly that - despite the Fortune 100 status - you'll see right through the BS, egos, and valid liability issues in no time. The organization proudly stresses the companies 5 core values repeatedly (particularly integrity) but does not abide by them whatsoever. One of the OpCos states it is female friendly despite teams of men do not treat you with any respect, exclude you from team meetings, and it is a predominantly male dominated ""good old boys"" club. This is - hands down - the worst company I have ever dealt with in over 30 years of working with a variety of companies, roles and geographic locations.
Advice to Management
Please retrain yourselves on the company values, abide by them, and set good examples as ALL good leaders do. Corporate - please investigate your leadership at OpCos and what's really happening before someone hits you with a valid lawsuit because your leadership parties do not have the intellect to understand liability and that their choices do have consequences. Be accountable for your actions when you hire a person willing to relocate from out of the area and you grossly fail to produce what you sold as a viable position and organization. Lastly, please keep your egos where they need to be - you are only selling food; not performing brain surgery and saving human lives. This company has great potential; unfortunately, it has a long way to go to be a great and respected leader like others in the Fortune 100 and 500 status clubs.

Meeting every Friday going over all the wrongs your doing in the field and then a GSM Meeting at the local OPCO usually a few hours drive to go over whatever new worthless items your will have to push on your clients. Lastly last weeks numbers are history, if you did great last week you can easily be the scape goat this week. Pay is OK but does not equal the amount of work you will put out. You will be at the will of you clients and they are demanding and petty. Asking for PTO is like pulling teeth from these managers, and yes you will work every holiday! Pay is around $51,500 they way to above is to sell more than your salary and you will never have a set salary one year it migh be $65k next year your back to the base of 51k. You are at the will of your clients, this is a nickel and dime business your clients will stop buying from you for a simple reason as Eggs going up by 5 cents this week. If this in anyway does not sound like your cup of tee.... keep looking.

","Worked for the Saint Charles MO location for six months. This has been by far the WORST company I have worked for since becoming a CDL driver. Where do I start? Very unorganized with scheduling, from week to week you don't know what your off day will be. You work very long hours, and once you get home you have no energy to do anything, but eat and go to sleep. Management text you the NIGHT BEFORE to tell you ""stay home tomorrow."" Sometimes the text that you are off the following day can come anywhere between 8-9 pm, and to them this is normal. They DO NOT care about you as an employee, they only care our their products being delivered to their retailers. If you call and alert management that you're about to die, they're going to ask you can you delivery their products first and then you can die. This job is very, very strenuous on your body, Throughout the six month I was employed with Sysco I have acquired to many aches and pains. Most of the Drivers that have been with the company for years are limping and beat down. Many guys have gone out on lead due to injury. I've watched them ask drivers to clean out old products at restaurants, which we are not supposed to do) just to appease the restaurants managers. Long story short, if you want to feel like you're just a pawn this is the place for you. I don't recommend anyone working for a company such as Sysco.

Please stop the constant work day Fridays and monthly GSM's. They aren't making us want to work harder or providing any motivation. Just soul sucking. Mid-level management is so afraid of upper management in the opco that they don't speak their mind. They just become yes men, saying whatever the top people want to hear. Often initiatives are rolled out without any thought or process in place to make them work which just demoralizes sales. No budget throughout the year for any perks makes it hard to want to jump through the silly hoops they put in place. Pay is low compared to competitors and new people are being brought on with a higher salary making it really hard on the others. Doesn't matter if you work your whole life at Sysco, if they are done with you, you are escorted out, even with 33 years of employment with out even a mention. Sad.

2) Only two weeks (10 days) vacation for the first 5-7 years of employment. Vacation time and Sick time should just be PTO but it isn't.
3) It is very hard to move around to the jobs you feel you are most naturally supposed to progress to. It's easy to move laterally but promotion is hard.

Absolutely no communication between the workers and management, HR and the higher ups could care less about your problems. No work life balance since you're so exhausted you can't do anything on the weekends and have no time when you get off work. The equipment is old and they refuse to replace it, you red tag something and it takes days or weeks to fix it. The training program is very poor and many people walkout or quit within the first few days. There's no advancement despite them saying career advancement, you either pick or drive until you die. This is a temporary job as you can't do it forever because it's so hard on your body. Everyone hates the place but they have bills to pay so they can't quit. They talk down to you like you're an idiot and you don't know anything because they don't trust their employees. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.

Mon Feb 26 2018, Sales,"San Diego, CA",Former Employee ,Fantastic example of white male privilege,7,"Free food, decent healthcare. Many of the employees are great, but are overworked and underpaid.
","Predominately male and white. The company wants the exact same type of employee at every location in an effort to justify paying the lowest salary. A sales employee in California is expected to make the same salary as their counterpart in Alabama, even though the costs of living are vastly different. Employees are classified in tiers and salaries are capped. So if someone were content with being an administrative assistant for the rest of her career, and she has been with the company for 10+ years, her salary would NEVER increase. She does not get a salary increase for merit or cost of living. Bonuses are for executives only, and those come at the expense of their employees. 
Corporate has made some astounding and extremely expensive errors over the years. The spent over a Billion dollars trying to convert their system to SAP. During the beginning of that transition they decided to fire all of their local IT personnel and hire a firm in India (known for their H-1B violations) to reduce the cost of the transition because they mistakenly believe that all of their employees are computer literate and IT is easy. Sysco was very, very, very wrong. They had to bring back and hire new IT associates at every opco. Instead of a smooth transition to SAP, they had to revert to the ""old"" AS400 system.
Sysco also believed that as an entity, it can do no wrong and that they could easily have a merger with the second largest food supplier in the nation, US Foods, and everyone would love the idea. It was obviously going to create a monopoly and the FTC agreed. The merger was cancelled, which cost Sysco even more money. It probably doesn't help that Sysco and US Foods tend to ""swap"" employees on a regular basis.
Recent changes also led to the mass exodus of many talented, intelligent, hard-working and loyal employees. Many great employees are still there, but are expected to now do the work of 2-3 people without a salary increase. The only ""incentive"" is that they ""get"" is to keep their job.

I have only been working here for a couple of months and I'm averaging $1,500 a week which is very decent for a NEW CDL Class A driver and a NEW employee in the food delivery service industry. This is also considered ""base pay"" rates. The average delivery driver at my location makes upwards of $100k per year. Paid holidays, matches 401k (to ""X"" percentage), again AWESOME management team. Always eager to tell and coach when needed.
","Biweekly pay. Pallets are built by whom I can only assume are kinder garden children in adult male bodies. Very unorganized which makes finding each item for each individual stop challenging and down right frustrating at times. Delivery times are unrealistic. Routing sends you to stops either too early or during lunch windows. VERY PHYSICAL. VERY DANGEROUS. Nothing particularly unmanageable, but there are many occupational hazards. Typical delivery driver cons.

Thu Jun 22 2017, IT Team Lead,"Houston, TX",Current Employee ,"Corporate IT Dept - Great benefits, good culture (mostly)",5,"-Great benefits including ""extras"" outside of the typical insurance/401k structure
-Most senior management in IT are great leaders, empowering and motivational
-A culture of pitching in together and doing it right, big emphasis on ethics and code of conduct
-Dynamic environment (if you enjoy a challenge and shifting gears)
-Values diversity, longevity, and employee growth - lots of opportunities to grow your skills in leadership, job-related areas, and elsewhere
-Some positions compensation is above market

Overall, I think the pros outweigh the cons for my personal taste. I work well in an environment that changes - over the 3 years that I've worked in IT at Sysco, we've changed our management structure 3 times, changed IT strategy at least twice, and adopted new methodologies twice. Communication can be a challenge, but the change is generally well done so as along as you are comfortable switching gears, you'll be fine. Sysco offers a great benefits package including decent vacation/time-off and good ""perks"" like holiday hams and employee purchasing. The company also values employee learning and growth, and puts major effort into offering coaching/learning opportunities, especially if you are interested in management roles or learning better leadership. Compensation seems to be above market in some positions while under market in others, so it's hit or miss.
","-Dynamic environment (if you don't adapt well to change)
-IT specific: Very siloed, other departments will do their own thing, not much knowledge transfer between departments so you often compete with each other for resources unknowingly
-IT specific: support is mostly managed services, and the companies providing those services are not very focused on ""the customer experience"", so you often have to clean up their work
-Technology is ancient
-Some mid-level managers are inflexible and demotivating, leading with more of a carrot/stick mentality.
-IT specific: There's still a big grudge when Sysco unilaterally laid off most of the IT department (and brought in managed services) about 5 years ago or so, so those who have been around since before then often have a bone to pick and get very disgruntled quickly. It can be hard to work with those managers at times because they're too busy being upset about the decision made, and not interested in collaboration/furthering the business
-IT specific: Because most roles are filled by managed services companies, career growth within IT is very limited unless you go into management
-(might be a con to you) Often expected to go the extra mile, work outside of the typical 9-5

The cons are generally limited to roles that require collaboration and communication cross-functionally within the IT department. If your role will not require working with other groups often, then they may not apply much to you. Also, if you are looking for more technical roles, and are not interested in moving in management, the career opportunities are severely limited, though I see some of that changing in emerging technologies like cyber security and cloud architecture. 

In IT especially, you're often expected to put in extra work to meet deadlines or support major releases in off-hours. You also tend to get too many assignments, so your work/life balance may suffer a bit. I've noticed this in other departments, too, that the expectation is to do what needs to be done - if you're a ""roll your sleeves up, get to work"" kind of person, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you're motivated by a more structured environment with clear roles/responsibilities and boundaries, then this may not be the right culture for you.

Unrelated to IT specifically, the environment is extremely dynamic which can be a con if you are not flexible/adaptable. The company also uses very old technology as a backbone for its core systems, which can fail unexpectedly during business hours. Depending on your role, some of the systems you need to do your job may break once a week or once a month. However, support is usually pretty quick to get things working again (....unless you get one of the offshore groups, for some reason the company they picked to provide offshore support has no interest in comprehending problems, so they waste 2-3 days just trying to ask you the same questions over and over again)
Advice to Management
IT specific: Build more career paths within IT for entry level IT personnel that will move them into more technical roles. Encourage departments to work together instead of in a vacuum, so there's less frustration and competition for resources. Take a long hard look at the customer satisfaction rating of the managed services companies you contract with - they might offer great dev resources, but if the support/service is terrible, the rest of IT suffers.

Non-IT specific: More communication across all functional areas, more emphasis on building leadership skills with managers, especially mid-level managers.

Thu May 25 2017, Maintenance Mechanic,"Columbia, SC",Current Employee ,Glassdoor,0,"Since the beginning, John Baugh was the guiding force behind the founding of SYSCO. Baugh had grown up on a ranch near Waco, Texas, and got his start in the food business through a part-time job at a local A&P grocery store when he was in high school. He eventually founded Zero Foods Company of Houston, a Houston-based food distributor. In 1969 Baugh convinced the owners of eight other small food distributors to combine the nine companies, forming what he hoped to mold into a national food-service distribution organization, one that would be able to distribute any food despite its regional availability. The other eight original companies were: Frost-Pack Distributing Company (Grand Rapids, Michigan); Global Frozen Foods, Inc. (New York); Houston's Food Service Company (Houston); Louisville Grocery Company (Louisville, Kentucky); Plantation Foods (Miami, Florida); Texas Wholesale Grocery Corporation (Dallas); Thomas Foods, Inc. and its Justrite Food Service, Inc. subsidiary (Cincinnati); and Wicker, Inc. (Dallas). The combined 1969 sales for the nine founding companies were $115 million. Currently the vision is yet the same with the economic demands and crisis still yet SYSCO finds a way to stay above the rest.
","The Cons are typical with any other company of such magnitude. When there is change it is not always pleasant and you will have a few employees who don't appreciate the decisions being made. But over-all SYSCO is a good company to work for.

Days off (usually non-consecutive)

Until you get your own route, they call around 7-9pm to give you options for the next day's routes, but you were up at 2:30am to get there by 3:30 and worked a 12-16 hour day. Very little sleep. Your body is also destroyed, and if you work there a long time, assume you'll need new knees.

For newer drivers, give them specific routes so they can sleep through the night, and give them 2 days off in a row to recuperate from the hard work week.

It was hard to get used to it, but once you do (usually takes a few months) and get your own route, it isn't terrible.
