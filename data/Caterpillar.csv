A minimum of a Bachelor’s degree or four years experience in the field opens doors. Average is tolerated in some jobs, but they strive to employ the best talent. When jobs are eliminated some supervisors begin networking to find a job for their former staff. Caterpillar puts these people in 'The Pool'. Qualified folks in 'The Pool' who apply for open jobs are put at the top of the list over those who are already employed at Caterpillar. Caterpillar also offers access to an outside company who has services to help those in 'The Pool' to find a new job outside of Caterpillar in part by improving resumes and interviewing skills and tapping into their network for employers and recruiters.

Hire people open to change. Put one or two people in charge and LISTEN to your employees. Don't just pretend to care... Actually CARE! It's better for your bottom line in the long run. Your employees are your front line... They know what is working on the floor and what isn't.

Yellow blood has built Caterpillar and made it what it is. Yellow blood is almost gone as a part of the Cat culture. If you work hard, you can get it back.

Fri Apr 10 2020, Technical Support Engineer,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Good company with poor HR personnel,2,"Very likely a good place to work with good benefits.

Location in Chicago is conveniently located by Union Station.
","I interviewed with Caterpillar Digital at the Chicago location in December of 2019. Went through four rounds of interviews, all of which seemingly went very well. Throughout the interview process, the HR contacts I worked with were efficient and professional, just as you would expect from a large multinational corporation.

Unfortunately, after the interviews were over, so was the professionalism. In the weeks, and then months, after the final interview, I heard nothing back from the company. Over a period of two months, I reached out many times to both of the HR contacts I had interacted with. No response at all.

After two months of increasing disbelief, I reached out via email to the Chief HR Officer, Cheryl Johnson, describing my situation, along with a timeline of events and communication attempts. Due to the way Cat's email system is set up, (invalid addresses bounce) I'm fairly certain she got the email. Again, no response.

All of this transpired before the COVID-19 breakout, so that's not an excuse.

TL;DR - After an extensive interview process, three contacts within the Cat HR department, including it's leader, left an applicant twisting in the wind without any feedback at all.
Advice to Management
The company's ambassadors to outside talent, the HR organization, are creating a terrible impression of the company. You might want to find out why the Chief HR Officer is failing to address the issue, or at least check to see if her email still works.

","If you like doing one thing for a very long time, this is the place for you. And, you will most likely be doing this through a staffing agency for years before full-time employee status (if you're lucky).
Advice to Management
Create more and better opportunities for job movement and advancement throughout the organization, all levels of employment and titles.
Corporate: recognize the actions of the management at local levels (i.e. read the employee surveys) and act (emphasize act, this is an action word) accordingly. Just because the voice you hear is telling you want you want to hear doesn't mean it's a happy little family, especially when that same voice has been saying the same words for a decade or more. 
Considering there can be times when nearly 1/2 the workers are through staffing agencies, after they've been with you for 1 year, hire them in to full-time positions. Make this a corporate policy and not legislative mandates. Take some real and honest initiative to make the local facilities and communities a better place. If this means you also have to train the management how to put an employee through the termination process, then either do it or offer refresher courses.

Hire people with the right experience and stop using temporary agencies to fill spots with bodies. You might actually keep more of the hard workers if they arent having to do 5 other people's job and getting no recognition or increase in pay.

Advice to Management
I've been there for about 2 months, and by far this is the best company I have been at!!! They show the associates that they matter. If you want to learn something new, all you have to do is ask, let management know you are interested. 

Only frustration I've had or seen is when trying to set up my area, not having enough supplies or equipment readily available and then coaching us on time gaps.... 

Training is very minimal and hands on, it's a sink or swim kind of job. If you aren't a quick learner you won't make it. 

My advice for management is to get more equipment (printers, tape machines, scanners and scanner accessories, picking carts, etc) and set up an actual training program for new hires. I literally have gotten less than an hour explanation in some areas I've learned, which isn't enough to really send someone out to do the work and expect them to understand what they are doing.

Benefits are comparable to similar size companies. I had some great leaders and mentors that helped develop me. I gained a lot of experience with my years with Caterpillar. They kept challenges in front of me to keep me motivated.
","Company culture under new CEO is deteriorating. This is sad because culture was the most significant positive thing I noticed when I started with the company years ago. They have a great severance package. However, they don't follow their own processes with regard to their TTP (job loss) program. The employee in the job pool is supposed to get priority in the list of candidates who applied a given position. They choose to ignore their defined process and bypass the priority rules. This is sad when they claim to be focused on process discipline and structured processes. 

They are adapting the 'GE model' with STIP bonuses which turns out is not the best model to follow (reference GE position today). There is a pool of money to divide amongst employees. To give an employee additional money you have to take money away from another employee. So, the stated % of bonus in your compensation package might not be accurate.

I worked at Caterpillar full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Some of the best pay in the industry. Most are overpaid in fact, which causes it's own problems.
Cons
Lip service to the Code of Conduct while pulling some of the most unethical maneuvers and treating employees as a disposable asset to be flexed for ROI while demanding greater output from those remaining to maintain velocity.
HR Managers have no idea what's actually in the employee manual, and don't seem to care. Mid-level managers do whatever they want, crack racist and homophobic jokes, and then expect good leadership and Employee Opinion Survey ratings.
Company finally eliminated EOS because employee satisfaction had become interminably low due to continuously increasing Exececutives compensation and paying out on their Bonus Plans while canceling the incentive plan for everyone else. I guess decided why let employees see everyone else is just as disgruntled and risk return of unions.
Managers didn't adapt well to push by new CEO Jim Umplby to actually write Goals at start of year Vs. just fudging a summary of what employees did at end of year as ""Goals"". Managers were suddenly expected to coach and mentor, treating the ""Manager"" part of the job with top priority, which threw a company full of incompetent mid-level managers into disarray.
Advice to Management
Root out the rampant nepotism and cronyism. Good move leaving Peoria. It's an incestuous nest of rotten culture that no intelligent prospect would even consider setting down roots. Once the company tosses you, there's no other option for employment.
Really need to focus on Supervisors and Managers performance. Take action on leadership surveys and remove managers if no improvement

It is indeed core engineering and if you enjoy core engineering - this is the place! It is an international company and does most of it's functions in-house, which means that you have many diverse career options to choose from. They pay relatively on the high side too.
","Corporate hubris is rampant. Ability to pivot into digital space has been messy. Very hierarchical and less transparency in upper management levels. Careers in Machine learning, Big data and AI are mostly based on nepotism not meritocracy. It helps enormously if you're part of the 'Good Old Boys Club' to move up in your career. Most frontline engineering managers are in their 50s - and they've been managers for the last 15-20 years (similar to career politicians) and have very little appetite for new ideas, risk taking, etc. Employee development is poor. Peoria, IL (Cat Headquarters) is an absolutely featureless, culture-less town in which most of the exciting engineering jobs are located. So good luck if you want an exciting out-of-work life!
Advice to Management
Be humble, be willing to learn from other companies like the ones in Silicon Valley. Products are not being developed the way they were being developed in the last 70-80 years. Everything is being transformed very rapidly. Recognize that talent is a prime mover for company profits, and not just share-holder profits. OPACC (operating profits after capital charge) is not THE only key metric, many other things matter such as employee satisfaction, innovativeness. Please avoid choosing a top-heavy top-down approach towards innovation, creating a ""VP for innovation"" isn't going to get your innovative solution tomorrow, innovation is also a bottom up organic endeavor - which means that you as management have to strive hard to create that environment for innovation.

Employees were given notice 2 hours prior to end of shift that they had to work OT and that if they left they would be terminated. Not scheduling fri-sun work schedule until end of shift Thursday. Employees could not take care of family or personal business.

hiring practices were horrendous. Most new hires came through temp agency and they were scrapping the bottom of the available employment pool. Turnover with this group was extremely high.

","The company has changed from being value based and taking care of employees, to now just concerned about their own bottom line. Tax breaks were not shared in anyway with employees, which the CEO proudly told employees. 

When deciding to move on to another company for family reasons they made judgment of every policy relating to my departure in their favour. To include a housing appreciation cost dating back to the selling of my house when asked to move by the company. 

The company does not have a good way to measure performance as they have leaders whom simply play politics without execution.

","I was hired into Supply Chain but yet at one point we were all forced to manage union employees on the weekends. We were paid overtime for the extra work but it wasn't what the position should be doing (supply chain engineering). If I wanted a ""Section Manager"" job I would have applied for the many that were/are available. The whole position was pitched as an operational analytical position but quickly swapped to a ""Managing warehouse employees"" position. Be weary of this if you decide to come on board. It was also very dirty, the office was disgusting and hadn't been cleaned in years, and if you weren't working 10 hours+ days, everyday, you felt looked down upon.
Advice to Management
Don't describe a position as a supply chain engineering one but then make the same person manage a union workforce because you can't hire enough section managers. Understand that the blue collar culture of putting in long 65+ hour weeks is fine for some, but when you're hiring individuals for analytical work, with advanced degrees, times are changing and they won't stick around if you don't understand the disconnect.

Pros
Good compensation and benefits. International travel and relocation opportunities. Very diverse job opportunities across many product lines. Good culture and values at most locations. Management making efforts to improve work life balance and totally phase out “old school” autocratic management style
Cons
Difficult to advance beyond mid management and is very dependent on who you know and executive sponsorship. Very cyclical business cycles which puts your job in jeopardy every few years. A lot of turnover in recent years.
Advice to Management

I have been working at Caterpillar full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Caterpillar makes great products - their equipment is some of the best on earth and it does make the world a better place. The people there are generally good humans that care about their coworkers (this is universal across the 100,000 person company). Pay and benefits, while not as generous as it once was, is still quite competitive.
Cons
Caterpillar has some cons that are inherent in its industry and its history. (1) Downturns in the overall economy result in layoffs if flexibility hasn't been built into the cost structure (2015 saw 10,000 employee layoffs). (2) It's a manufacturing giant - that comes with many great things, but it also comes with locations that are less spectacular than other industries (you put factories where you can get reasonable labor charges and where people allow you to build a big, ugly factory. There's also a long history of union environments, which obviously can lead to some negative environments just from conflicts between ""management"" and labor over the years.
Advice to Management
Caterpillar has made some necessary changes over the years to continue to lead all of the industries in which it serves. Many of those things have been good things, but some have been at the expense of employees. My advice to management would be not to forget that a stable, long serving workforce has been what got them where they are today (Caterpillar is one of those companies employees have always stayed at for life - you hire in and you stay there forever). That, regrettably, has changed - Caterpillar has become much more comfortable with great people leaving. I think that's a dangerous and slippery slope. In the short run it seems cost effective, but I fear the cost of that loss of knowledge and expertise on a mass scale is going to ultimately hurt Caterpillar. It will still be a great company, but perhaps not as great as it might have been (we'll never know).

","This is a very shady business to work for. It is ok if you are young and need experience to show on your resume. Staying here for a long time though will taint your resume though.

Tue Dec 12 2017, Engineering Manager,,Former Employee ,Changing Company Over 10+ Year Tenure,3,"Early career development and training use to be great (different rotational training programs and on the job training opportunities). Plenty of networking opportunities which play a vital role in developing your career due to the large size of the company. Multiple potential career paths within the same company and usually supportive management that supports trying something new or different in the interest of your career. When market cycles are good, there is lots of positives with STIP (bonuses), more travel opportunities, training opportunities and more flexibility in R&D investments. Initially work/life balance was really a focus and felt valued by management.
","Work environments were seen purely as a cost and so many facilities are outdated with dated equipment and no desire to shift any resources at addressing this. When market cycles are down, there is a massive negative shift in the work environment as STIP (bonuses) are all but cut which for most employees is a large contribution of their total compensation. Market down cycles result in business cases to justify everything from business trips, to simple equipment acquisitions and a lot of redundant budget churn multiple times a year in a large wasted effort of human capital to try and justify each line item. There has been a large shift in the view of the workforce over the 10+ year tenure with the company and employees are really viewed as a number and a cost to the bottom line. In downturns, workforce cuts are much more common and a lot more impersonal and quite devastating in the way they are executed. The shared 2 way street of loyalty between employee and the company feels a lot more like a one way street and as people were cut, the work/life balance was valued a lot less as the same output was expected from the remaining fewer employees. Top level management shifts have moved away from the life long, employee to a lot more external focused trying to find external leaders and lots of number crunchers who know less about the markets, dealers and customers and simply try and run the company by the numbers. This focus on external talent for top level leadership is causing a log jam as talent internally can't move up and the value of internally diverse, company built careers is lowering. Additionally, the increased focus on outsourcing jobs and contract work out was an alarming trend that was a short term P&L benefit but will have serious long term negatives.
Advice to Management
In your efforts to grow and adapt, you must remember what strengths have gotten you this far. Employees want to bleed Cat Yellow for you but that loyalty must be a 2 way street. Your employees are an investment, not a cost line on your P&L statement that you try to creatively minimize. Continue to build your key leadership from within as the company has gotten where it is built on the backs of its people who grew up through the company and new the product inside and out, not just how to make the financials look good in the short term. You must be able to identify and remove people in leadership that are ineffective or simply beyond their capabilities and not just move them onto new roles or promote them somewhere else. There was an alarming number of leaders who did not know the business, the product or their people and were now in critical decision making roles. Your rising leaders see this and need to know that the company can make these changes when needed.

","If you're an IT professional, good luck when the company's business cycle hits a downturn. The company ALWAYS over-reacts to this, and still has no idea how to weather the storm, laying off thousands of good people, and since IT is not valued by the company, it gets hit hard. Did I say IT is not valued by the company? Want proof? How much IT background does their current ""CIO"" have? NONE.

The pay wasn't horrible, below what you could make doing other things.

The cost of living in the areas CAT operates in are pretty good.
","The areas that CAT operates in are horrible, Peoria Illinois is a dumpster fire, Griffin Georgia is another. List goes on and on. They are all one horse towns that do not have competitors so Caterpillar can lock you down without fear of losing you.

It's a cyclic business, you will either be forced out of a job you like towards a job you don't when it comes time to shuffle people around.

They don't see the big picture, shutting down research was an incredibly bone headed move that is going to back sting them in years to come. Also downsizing and trying to attract new talent is a problem, people talk and it's hard to convince new college grads to give them a try when the only things people hear about them are bad.

Caterpillar will not offer you chances to improve yourself, what you hire in for is what they expect out of you, no career growth. Don't worry about going back for a part time degree, you won't need it at CAT. I watched many people leave to pursue academic pursuits because their boss didn't have their back.

In times of crisis (Union strike), engineers, accountants etc (desk jobs) get pulled into the factory so Caterpillar continues to meet quota while they bully the unions. If you had hope of being a software developer, don't be surprised to find out you get to learn how to weld as well!

They seem to like employees living in fear and trying to step on one another - so much for 'teamwork'. Decent pay but not a good work environment. Employees do not trust management or HR.
Advice to Management
Stick to what you know, pay attention once in awhile to an 'outsider' who might know more than you think. Lose the arrogance - Cat is not what it used to be. The brand doesn't wear as well as it once did. Please upgrade your 'should be in a museum' Engineering system.

International assignments still available but very difficult to get compared to what it was before. Lots of advancement opportunities during the upturn. Cool products and strong brand value.
","Cyclical business and the company is not afraid of cutting back during the downturn which drives lot of good talents away voluntarily and involuntarily. Advancement can be slow even for high performers if becoming too important to the current job role. It's not a place where you will be surrounded by lots of talented people. Middle management seemed weaker compared to other global company of its size or bigger. Mid and Senior Management relies heavily on outside consultants to get thing done and/or tell them what to do which can be frustrating sometimes.
Advice to Management
The overall talent pool in the Peoria area especially the Middle management level is not very strong compared to other companies similar size or even smaller in the major metropolitan areas. It's harder to attract and retain the top talents who are willing to move to Peoria if they are not already in or from the area. Should further expand the corporate office and move even more business units to Deerfield where the location itself will attract more talents let alone the company brand name.

","Upper management poor at backfilling roles for people who choose to not stay with the company (especially when CAT has plenty of advanced notice before this happens). This is crucial for knowledge transfer, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be a priority.

Wed Aug 02 2017, Data Scientist,"Champaign, IL",Former Employee ,"Data Science and Analytics. Champaign, IL.",2,"You will get to work on a variety of work. The office leadership at the Champaign Simulation Center is good to work with. They seem to be on top of things and know their employees. You will be given ownership of a project and you make your own decisions. 

Champaign-Urbana is a great place to live and raise a family.

Has an open office culture and people are pretty friendly with one another. 

Opportunities for mentoring younger workers. Also can receive mentorship from more experienced workers. 

You can probably make an adequate paycheck. If living in a calm, family-oriented area is important to you, this would not be a horrible place to work. Understand though that it will take you your entire career to *possibly* make a healthy paycheck. 

The Champaign Simulation Center is a good place to work. I have a positive outlook for it. The company as a whole is wandering right now. Very cyclic. But the CSC is a decent place of employment. This is where it's at. At least in my case, I would burn out really quickly if I had to work in Peoria. You would be one of 100,000 small cogs in the dimly lit cubicle machine.
","Heavy bureaucracy. Structure of the upper leadership of the company is very bloated and superfluous. It was impossible to keep track of who all of the supervisors were. It was not entirely clear what half of them even did. They were just ""chief directing supervisor of supervising the undersecretary to the assistant manager of analytics.""

EVERYTHING had an acronym, and the acronyms changed every month. Main hub of the company seems to be a swiftly tilting ship. Absolutely no stability. I think I worked for three different divisions in the course of three or so months. 

""Diversity"" was valued over competence. I come from a pretty diverse family (father born in Polynesia, have black, Japanese, Filipino, Cherokee relatives). I have lived in a number of places in the US and Asia. I would consider myself somewhat liberal in social matters. But I still expect higher leadership to actually know what is going on, not just be a good face to look at. I'm not sure I saw that here. 

Very little motivation to work for the cause of the company as a whole. You have a 50-50 chance of being laid off no matter what happens, so it's not like the employees actually feel Caterpillar has their back. 

Pay is not amazing. It's okay. You will not be poor. But you will have to value location over paycheck. I know of a good number of people who leave Caterpillar just because the pay does not overcome the deep bureaucracy and tumultuous position of the company. When I can walk away and earn $25k more in a similar real estate market, it takes a lot of loyalty to a group of nameless CEO/Vice Presidents in order for me to stay. Highly educated people in the tech industry rarely are that desperate for a job.
Advice to Management
Fewer acronyms. Pay grade for computer science and statistics people is too low. Someone with a PhD in computer science and no need for visa sponsorship is probably not going to work for $80k a year. Leadership is bland and uncompelling. Never felt inspired to work hard for the cause. I honestly was not even sure what the ""cause"" was. No one gives a hoot about business jargon filled goals. Give me a real cause to work for, not just the CEO's pocketbook.

","There are too many remnants of the old school methodology of managing employees. Caterpillar is slow to recognize it's management issues and resolve them. They would rather lay off or release employees than come to grips with the real nagging issues of lackluster performance. They send great employees out the door so that they can hire in cheap employees fresh from the universities. By doing so, they are sending a large amount of brain trust out the door and costing themselves performance as it typically takes about 2 years for 80% of the new employees to come up to speed on the ""Caterpillar way"" of doing things.

Supervisors have not defended employees who were not allowed to speak up in a meeting that the supervisor was in attendance. Supervisors have been so talkative in one-on-one meetings that the employee had no time to say anything. Supervisors unfairly rate their favorite pet employee high and grant them promotions while never favoring other employees who are just as good, if not better than their ""pet"" employee. It is an environment based on favoritism, politics, verbal bullying, and a stubborn unwillingness to recognize the rights of others. This is a management style that should have died long ago.

","Company is totally run by finance people. The only thing that matters is shareholder value, but a vast majority of current employees are not shareholders and the company leader do not seem to realize this. Company does not lead. Waits to see what others do and adapts. They talk big about innovation, but massive corporate bureaucracy stifles any innovation. Strange corporate culture - They say they want new blood and ideas from the outside, but once you are there, unless you have come up internally through the ranks, your ideas are ignored. Promotion opportunities nearly non-existent for mid-career hires, even in good times. You have to come in right out of college and be on a leadership career path to be considered at all for promotion. Internal succession planning groups control all career paths and the personal biases of those in these groups determine who is on an upward career path. When the company struggles financially, they continually go to the same play book and conduct massive layoffs and plant closures.
Advice to Management
Invest in your people. Offer employees stock options or some kind of equity in the company. Remove the finance people from the decision making process. Eliminate succession planning group input for all but executive level positions. Spend some money on corporate services for once. Stop being so risk adverse and lead for a change. Empower your people innovate and reward such innovation. When cycles are down, show your people that you are invested in them by not laying off people and reduce costs in other areas.
