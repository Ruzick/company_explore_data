I worked at Duke Energy full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Salary was decent. Benefits were so-so.
Cons
Favoritism runs rampant especially if located at corporate headquarters. Inconsistent application of policies, no HR support in field. Outsourced HR service center is awful. Took retirement benefits away from employees that came from acquired Florida company. Downsizes right at the holidays.
Advice to Management
You have destroyed the morale of the employees. You have taken the “human” interactions and support out of what a Human Resources department once represented. Employees are your strength so treat them fairly. You will continue to lose excellent long time employees due to your clouded vision of how HR should function.

","There is an immense amount of knowledge that needs to be retained. Between the computer (applications and documentation) , NERC (IT503) , Safety to actually doing the job.

Advice to Management
1) Make a support team for ""Duke-energy"" techs and not contract relay support. Much support needed for relay techs. 2) Make a SIMPLIFIED website for relay techs to find anything that is needed for us. Be it safety, construction, maintenance, NERC, relay manuals that we may need to find, etc. 3) Training. I mean training on the grid/substation and not just compliance training.

Advice to Management
I know that both operations and security at every location across the nuclear fleet are incredibly unhappy with the company and senior management. Everyone i know that has more than 5 years before retirement and some that are within that window are seeking employment elsewhere. In the last few years the company cut hundreds+ of positions, many of which had 10-25 years with the company to save money for the company to compete with natural gas and stay competitive. Next year top 3 company leaders had pay and bonuses in millions. Google the articles and you will understand why so many employees do not like the way the company is being run.

During the pandemic, they fought to keep their employees on the payroll, even distributing teammates without work to do to support other teams instead of layoffs.

Thu Oct 01 2020, Engineering Technologist,"Greensboro, NC",Former Employee ,Ready to be nothing more than a glorified retail worker? This place is for you!,0,"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. 


- the paycheck never bounced

- OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects

- place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics...

- surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. 

- An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with!

- Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! 

- I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. 

- Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. 

- ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. 



- The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though...

- Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.
","You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. 

- Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con...

- Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people.

- Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. 

- Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. 

- Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. 

-Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. 

-Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. 

- Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point...

- No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con...

- Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before...

- Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed
2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate
3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done
4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms.

- Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. 

- Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. 

- Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. 

- Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of...

- Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. 

- HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. 

There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.
Advice to Management
Oh there is no amount of advice management will ever listen to. The CEO and all the little VP's/Directors are rolling in their fat stacks of cash, hiding behind all of the other departments so they don't have to deal with the clients. Maybe they'd listen if their numbers and emails were public knowledge, which if you bother the call center enough they might just give it to you. More than likely nothing will come of it though, management has many layers to hide behind while they collect their sweet revenue from the yearly rate increase. Always fun watching the proposed rate increases get denied!

Bring back the mythical former Marketing department that was the interface between engineering and the general public, and maybe things will go smoother. Have them do the actual work behind the scenes instead of babysitting these external parties and trying to have engineering be the public face of Duke. No sense in focusing on ""customer service"" in a monopolized business when you can do much better by focusing on installing quality/safe infrastructure, along with holding these external parties accountable instead of bending to their will. There's a lot more to be said but I think the reader gets the general idea of where this is going... engineering in distribution is nothing more than a glorified retail or food server job, don't expect to be nothing more than the powerless middle-man who shoulders all the burden.

Advice to Management
Stop making changes for the sake of change. Assess your priorities and limit the number of initiatives and projects you implement in a given year. Most employees are doing the jobs of 2-3 people and teetering on the edge of burnout. Also, frequent organization restructuring with downsizing, leadership changes and new roles that are forced on employees does not create psychological safety or instill trust in the company. Also, consider promoting people who have less time with the company and are actually qualified to do the job. Tenure is all that seems to count. Most senior leaders have been with the company 20 years or more, and many of them were promoted only because they are strong individual contributors and someone with authority vouched for them - but they do not make good leaders. Lastly, think about providing bonuses based on individual performance to incentivize and reward employees who exceed expectations. This would require managers to work with employees to set meaningful goals, which is not done on a consistent basis.

Sun Apr 21 2019, Senior IT Applications Analyst,"Charlotte, NC",Current Employee ,"Interesting Work, Excellent 401K, Good Work/Life Balance",2,"Just what the title says. It's a fun place to work for software development, using the latest cloud technologies with management receptive to fresh ideas, researching, and problem-solving. Software developers are respected. Been here over a year and only asked to work on a Sat once for a big, rare upgrade, never asked to stay late and encouraged to take vacation (3 weeks) as well as take company-paid training. 401K match is 4% then up to 6% matching, which has been great. Can work remotely if I'm sick or have an appointment at home which is nice. Speaking up, collaboration, helping others is highly encouraged.
","A few teams could follow the Agile approach to their benefit a bit more closely. Some get a little ""too eager"" to push forward without requirements, but they do welcome honesty and pushback if needed. A bit more focus on lowering customer costs in order to keep them happy would be welcome, but that's out of my area of expertise in my department.

Overall, a pleasant place to work with decent to great benefits. Bringing on contractors a bit sooner as full-time would be nice as I know several contractor coworkers are anxious to join. I haven't seen much high turnover compared to places I've been which is a positive thing that says a lot. For IT, I'd suggest a more progressive approach for < 40-hour workweeks as long as goals are met, but that's a tough thing to wish for from most companies. Would highly recommend Duke to anyone in software development.

Fri Mar 02 2018, Project Manager,,Former Employee ,Project Manager,8,"Duke provides budgets adequate to get the job done. They used to support their project managers in mitigating risks and resolving issues, but this has eroded due to recent acquisitions.
","Play favorites in providing training. Contractor PM's are treated differently than employee PM's. Appears that only women and minorities are offered to convert to employees. Identity appears to trump success in project assignements. Tools to manage budgets are inadequate. There is a lot of bureaucracy and red tape, mostly associated with accounting, to go through to get projects approved past the Commit gate. Sometimes it takes so long for projects to be approved that the sponsors forgot they even requested it.
Advice to Management
Provide a clear path for a contractor to become an employee. Don't treat contractors differently than employees, especially when it comes to training. Become a true race-blind, gender-blind organization by focusing on who does the best job rather than appearances. Throw out your project accounting / time reporting system as it is awful. Streamline your project approval process.

","No work life balance during storm mode. I walked 2 miles in the snow to make it to work or I would be fired. Be prepared to spend days in a hotel during high outages. You get less than 2 seconds in between calls to breathe or take a sip of water. Turnover is high!! I worked a 3rd shift where I never saw my supervisor. Team leads ran the team. Micro managed on adherence. Non existent breaks. They also added gas calls and progress energy after the merger and only offered $1.50 raise which is an insult after we were forced to train for all these new systems. New reps need to be hired starting at $18+ with all the work they have to do.
Advice to Management
Make your supervisors do more instead of sit behind a desk in the office. Also make them motivate there reps. Job is very stressful and when your supervisor is more concerned about you being in acw for 20 seconds to drunk water then motivation towards better stats there's a problem.

I was fortunate to have a great supervisor!
","The job was very stressful in its self but then they started rotating our schedules working days, nights and weekends. Many employees had to quit or find a new job in Duke.
Upper management (VP and above) showed a lack of concern many times in the decisions they made which affected not just us regular employees but supervisors and managers who were constantly forced to try and do MORE with LESS!! ... and that always affects customers in and outside the company!
Advice to Management
Duke Energy should be thought of as a company that sits on a 3 legged stool. 
Each leg is VITAL to its success. 

Too long one leg has been esteemed more important than the others. 
That leg is Wall Street or the perception of WS. 
Examples are laying off or downsizing employees, robbing (yes I said robbing, sounds better than stealing) employees of their sick time hours that they had saved for many many years and giving them a set amount per year that does not come close to helping if you have a terminal illness!
Another is Upper Management you get paid to make wise decisions for ALL of us, please put yourself in our place before you make them. For 2-3 years we did not know what to expect when it came to where we would work or if we would have a job, it was always UNKNOWN.
The other two legs are easy to guess, customers and employees.

Some paid travel to head quarters in Charlotte. Very Safety minded. Some site managers are very great to work with, very knowledgeable, and eager to train and promote employees. Renewables is growing. This position has a flexible schedule, good work life balance.
","Limitations on moving up within the company, especially in Renewables. Feels like a ""good ol' boys club"". Not a diverse group. Upper Management doesn't understand day to day operations or life in rural areas. Area Managers are not held accountable. If a site manager can talk the talk, nobody will actually look into whether or not that manager is doing their job, following policy or procedures nor if they are holding their staff accountable. This position is very repetitive, and not many extra projects, challenging projects. To move up from this position is difficult because of lack positions within the group that relate to the skill set and background you already have as an SRC. It seems like any experience prior to Duke Energy doesn't count once you have been hired and start looking to move within the company.

","This job was the worst experience both personally and professionally that I have ever encountered. I was a customer service rep at the Charlotte based call center for 2 years. Looking back, I honestly can't believe I stuck it out that long. It is really no wonder that this company has such high job turnover rates. This company sets unbelievably high and humanly impossible standards.Work here and you will suffer constant verbal abuse from customers, you will be consistently required to work 12-16 hour shifts at less than 5 minutes notice. There is ZERO work/life balance. I had to come into work the night of my bridal shower and work until 4am the next day because there was a stupid thunderstorm in Indiana. It counts against you to use earned paid sick time. You are treated like a pre-schooler and constantly watched and monitored everywhere in the building and parking lot by seniority. You will go ""on report"" for little things like walking while talking on your cell phone. Oh, and you will only make $12 an hour for giving up your life to serve this company.

","Since the merger with Progress there has been nothing but trouble. Progress was in financial ruins due to management running that company into the ground. Unfortunately much of that management has been brought into Duke. There are numerous managers (upper level) that do not have degrees nor the competence and training to do their job. The Progress side is like a fraternity that sticks together and promotes each other within. It is very disheartening. They are quickly running out the talent and bringing this once fine company down. I have seen employees use their company cards for lunch every day of the week as well as company vehicles given to employees that have no need. Instead of making employees move to Charlotte they allow a large number of individuals to travel almost weekly on the company’s dime to Charlotte headquarter. The fleecing is alarming. I am concerned not only as an employee but as a customer of Duke as well. This company is in serious need of a management over hall.

","The downside is almost no flexibility for working parents. They talk the talk, but don't walk the walk. They are consistently listed as being great for working mothers, but my experience is that it depends on your manager. I currently have a manager who detests flexible scheduling of any kind.

But in contrast, I have a co-worker who frequently sleeps at his desk. Priorities, anyone?

","Once Duke bought out Progress Energy, the corruption begain in full force. The legacy Progress Energy CEO (Bill Johnson ) was now in charge of Duke. However, that was short lived and lasted less than a day. The company released him and gave him $44 million dollars. This was all over the news with a multitude of negative criticism.

Fast forward in time which brings us to our new CEO Lynn Good. During 2014, the Dan River Coal Ash spill occurred which had significant repercussions and legal fines. During the year 2015, the CEO'S salary more than doubled along with several substantial increases to the executives salary. All can be easily found doing a Google search.

The first day of 2016 the company invoked a substantial cap on the amount of overtime hours you can get paid for when supporting planned or emergent plant outages. This was a new policy the executives enforced to save the company money. In addition, several non executive positions have been cut and will not get replaced.

","Individual contributors are buried under excessive layers of incompetent management that are all desperate to prove how useful they are. Turnover rate for top talent is pretty high, and what's left bubbles up into management, mostly based on seniority, not skill.

Any attempt at innovation or original thought is quickly squashed by a pervasive ""this is the way we've always done it"" monoculture. Very slow to adapt.

Pay for IT jobs is way below market average. Benefits are not what they used to be, so it's become even less competitive than it was in years past, and that's not saying much.

Management has basically been a game of musical chairs for years now. Re-orgs several times a year means that your manager is pretty much guaranteed to not have a clue about what you specialize in, but that doesn't stop most of them from from micromanaging you and telling you how you should do your job.
Advice to Management
Take the advice of individual contributors who are experts in their field rather than middle management who micromanage projects and technical decisions despite having zero actual experience with the functional areas they manage.

Recognize and provide meaningful incentives for employees who are technical experts and provide solutions and ways to stay competitive in business. Duke has bled off most of its best talent in IT as a result of this myopia.

Sat Apr 18 2015, Nuclear Engineer,"Southport, NC",Current Employee ,Bloated Bureaucracy and Nasty Coworkers,5,"Pay & Benefits Are Satisfactory. The beach and major amenities are nearby and the cost of living is rather low. Plenty of ""opportunities"" to succeed. For engineering: for the most part documentation is strong making information relatively trivial to find. Engineering management is very good and fair. Many meals are comp'd by the company which definitely shows the company is showing us we are worthwhile. They also have an amazing relocation package (there are significant cons to it, see cons).
","Chronic acceptance of plant problems by management and personnel. They must close their eyes while they are saying ""we will not accept problems"". If you end up identifying longstanding problems(like they tell you they want you to do) it becomes your problem to solve them. It can be quite frustrating and overwhelming. Coworkers are thickheaded and not receptive to innovative ideas and can be extremely cynical and negative - it is contagious. There is a reason why this facility has struggled for years to even simply make par with regulating organizations - the culture of its employees is terrible! More on that: personnel are very clichy. If you don't agree with them on issues be prepared for your job to be impossible. There is a subliminal level of harassment to this. In all honesty I'd have left within a couple on months of the job initially; however, per the relocation agreement, I'd owe every cent of a hefty sum back if I left within two years of my hire date. There are still quite a few new hires that have left within a couple months of being hired and paid back the money anyway just to get out. I am counting down to my two year mark.

* Employees really do care about how we serve our customers and go to high levels to make sure our operations are safe and clean.
","* Change, change, change, change ... get the point?
* Don't try and teach an old dog a new trick. Duke Energy hurts itself because too many people have been there for a LONG time and they do not comprehend the importance of integrating modern ideas or technologies into the company culture.
* Internal technologies and platforms are HORRIBLE and/or outdated. No money for improvements, but a lot of money for other unimportant things.
* Cuts, cuts, and more cuts! Departments are operating on fumes while overworking their staff with no relief in the foreseeable future. Employees are told to do more with less, but the problem is that they have been doing more with less for years, but now it will get worse.
* Regulated Utility=No $$. The government and EPA regulate the heck out of the company. Hard work will never equate to a good living and high earning potential unless you are an executive. Go to BP or Shell.
* Limited potential for promotions. You'll need to leave to climb the ladder.
* Not all, but most of mid-management (different titles across the company) is the problem. Many do not have the experience or got the job because of good old Duke tenure. Duke fails to train people how to be managers, directors or good communicators.
* Very top leaders are good peeps, but one who runs several units is well known for ruling with a fist of fear. Those business units are stifled with fog because everyone is afraid to make a decision. This is another reason things will not change.

I enjoyed working with almost everyone that I came in contact with, and really enjoyed my time there. Aside from feeling included, I really enjoyed the work that I did there. With every assignment I took on, I was given feedback immediately after completing the task whether it be good or bad. Also, everyone that I worked with and/or worked for was very approachable. I felt that I could go to anyone at anytime and ask them whatever I needed to know. If I was having trouble with a task, everyone was more than willing to help out. Communication within the company was excellent. Everyone on the team knew what any other member of the team was doing at almost any given time. Another plus was the compensation. I feel that I was well compensated for my responsibilities as an employee at Duke Energy, and the benefits package was great as well.
","I did not really experience any downsides of the company while I worked there. With my position, there was a great deal of travel involved which some people might not have enjoyed but I really liked the traveling. The only problem that I really had was dealing with the help desk within the company. The company uses a ticket system to assign tasks to different teams depending on what was needed. However, sometimes when a problem was reported, the ticket would be assigned to the wrong group and would have to bounce around until we could find the group that needed to handle the problem. Though this was not a huge problem, it did get annoying sometimes. Other than this, I really enjoyed every other aspect of working for the company.

Very interesting and diverse work. The management is generally very strong and employee oriented. There is potential for growth but you need to develop your own networking system.

They offer a rotation program in the IT department so you can experience many different facets of IT prior to deciding where you will settle.

The senior management tends to keep employees in the dark as to far reaching plans. We found out about the Progress merger through news outlets.

Ample opportunity to learn and advance in field of work/study is provided and many of the same benefits and opportunities available to regular full-time employees are also made available to co-op students.
","The inability of local management to offer or guarantee a co-op student a full-time job upon graduation can be frustrating.

Advice to Management
Overall the company appears to be managed pretty well. I would however suggest better management of the deletion of retirees, ex-employees and contracts from various system and database ""shares"" who were once ""owners/administrators"" . I was surprised to have multiple experiences where owners/administrator where no longer with the company for a number of years yet still had status for various types of shares and databases.

I have been working at Duke Energy
Pros
Fortune 500 company, access to latest technology, interesting company and service delivery. Very nice working environment, nice facilities. Company has a great reputation in the communities it serves.
Cons
Layers and layers of management slow down the development process. Many decisions require multiple layers of approval. Work is paced in short bursts of productivity.
Advice to Management
Reduce the ratio of employees to contractors. Hire more managers from outside of the company. Consider direct hires for IT positions. Many good candidates who are not willing to step backwards (to be a contractor) will not consider open positions at Duke.

","Communication isn't always what it could be. Some departments seem to treat their employees differently than others - not consistent. Current economic concerns might stretch into limiting company needs a bit too much.
Advice to Management
Be willing to listen to your employees. Surveys are good, but really take time to hear what the emoployees are saying in terms of their concerns.
