I have been working at Lowe's Home Improvement full-time
Pros
Ability to learn many new skills beyond just standard Excel/Access (SQL, BI, and various productivity tools). Large company with large data sets, so a great opportunity to learn with big data. Good relationship with management and a lot of leverage to be creative and learn new things. Competitive pay structure and bonus program.
Cons
PTO is significantly lower than other companies I have worked at and only increases at 5 year increments. Not particularly industry competitive in that regard.
Advice to Management
Mostly like the direction the company is going in, but need to hold senior leadership accountable to the same (or higher) standards as normal employees, which doesn't always seem to happen. Also need to stay future oriented; catching up on things we're behind on is good, but need to be out front as a leader as well.

Management at my store is great, but they need to add loss prevention team members and HR back to stores. People steal everything and we can’t do much to stop them other than offering to help them find what they need and asking if they have a receipt when they set off the EAS system.

-Compensation is above average (If you negotiate for it), bonus program is solid, stock bonus is good.
-Lots of room for growth in this company
-","stently challening with lots of room to show off personal talent and ideas. Corporate does not have a heavy hand, while they give lots of direction, you are free to make lots of decisions for the benefit of your store.
Cons
-ASM's shoulder a lot of responsibility and workload.
-Company is in a place of change. Some changes have been enormously helpful for the company but others have had detrimental effects at store level (ie, reliance on 3rd party services instead of in-house labor for certain jobs)
-Work/life balance can be tricky to maintain at this level
Advice to Management
-Strongly consider the impact of 3rd party programs that have been implemented over the last 12-18 months (Assembly, facility services, and delivery). While each store is going to have different experiences with the 3rd party vendors, most stores agree that these vendors have not added significant value at the store level. 
-The MST is wildly inconsistent. While some stores may have effective teams, many at my level view this team as underutilized and poorly managed.
-Even though there has been significant investment into Pro Services over the last year, I believe we are still not positioned to take meaningful market share away from competitors. We lack the infrastructure, partnerships, and staffing to do this. While the company will continue to roll-out new initiatives over the next few years, staffing at the store level has to be a key factor. Pro Services should have 50% more specialists and CSA's, a dedicated order pulling team, 1st party Pro delivery (Even if it is in the form of smaller footprint vehicles that can bring critical job materials within an hour. Ex, the auto parts delivery industry), and district level account managers.

","There is a lot of 'aggressive finger-pointing' at Lowe's. 

Management says one thing and acts a different way. They say, ""be bold, dont be afraid to fail, but fail fast and fix fast, learn and grow."" But then managers call out people by name, in public, whenever anything goes wrong. 

Rather than figure out the root cause and learn from it, Directors and Engineering Managers want to find out what Domain and Team and person is responsible for it. It is a toxic atmosphere. 

Lowe's has lost a lot of good talent because of this toxic atmosphere. Unfortunately, you can't fire your boss. (this is why I'm on this site, looking for a new job)

Also, many folks working in the U.S. tech side are making way under scale. Way under.
Advice to Management
Stop the aggressive finger-pointing between Domains in the tech side (Digital).
Care for those folks that make it possible for you to make your billions. Don't publicly chastise them and make them live in fear of making mistakes.

It should at least be level that all specialists sales need to be on Lowe's credit.
Advice to Management
You have employees that have stepped up and worked more than their share during this pandemic. Unlike Home Depot who gave their employee's raises; you offered a $2.00 pay differential, for only 4 weeks in April of 2020, which excluded overtime worked. You gave a few $300.00 hardship bonuses throughout 2020 when you should be giving permanent raises to your dedicated employees.

","Entitled customers—created by management never saying no

Little support or back up from management when dealing with unruly, demanding customers — who are becoming more and more frequent.

More duties, more demands, more expectations, no increase in man hours

Upper level decisions that show how disconnected the upper management are with the work we do and what the needs of the department are

Do we really have to watch Lowe’s TV in the break room—can we not get a break from Lowe’s-speak for the 15 minutes we are trying to relax?

Not adhering to COVID cleaning protocols, no limit on the number of customers in the store, no mandatory mask/shield requirements for customers
Advice to Management
Try to think more about the people that keep your business up and running. The customer isn’t always right and we’d appreciate knowing that someone has our back. It feels like money and stockholders are the only thing that matters—our sales are through the roof—Spread some of that blessing to the associates in a permanent decent raise (not 11 cents). Setting 2021 sales goals based on the crazy comps from 2020 is completely unrealistic and self defeating.

I like taking responsibility and have learned a lot in the last few months about my job and myself.
","Training is abysmal. Showing folks a few videos and then tossing them to the wolves is not a productive strategy. Even if my supervisor tries to train us on the floor, we continually get interrupted by customers, and training is never completed. Staffing is a continual problem at my store. I will often be covering at least 3 departments and get in trouble for not being in my own department enough. Code 3 calls for help are constant. Systems are archaic and do not talk to each other. You have to enter the same information at least twice, sometimes 3 times, and if you forget or get distracted by a customer, it's all your fault. I know it's retail, and retail is a chaotic environment at best, but please, please, bring your systems into the 21st century. It is impacting your sales like crazy.
Advice to Management
Ramp up hands on training by supervisors. Find ways to allot time off the floor for supervisors to work with their staff to ensure they know their job well. Invest in new software, your current systems are costing you money. Find a way to improve top stock procedures. Many lost man hours are spent looking for things that either are not there, or in a place where they do not belong. For my store at least, staffing needs to be improved. Too many times entire departments are unstaffed, forcing other departments to cover for them. This costs sales opportunities and results in frustrated customers who leave the store without making a purchase.

Fri Jan 15 2021," Overnight Receiver, Stocker",,Current Employee ,Another corporate mistake.,0,"The only upside that I can truly say this job offers is decent pay for your time, sometimes.
","Pay doesn't always reflect your workload. Somedays, we'll get a 400 piece truck, or smaller, and with multiple people putting it away, it's almost as if it's free money. Here recently, multiple people from the weekday and weekend teams have quit, leaving 2-4 people putting up 1000+ piece trucks, including whatever is left over from days before. Nothing gets done, and it adds excessive stress on employees as if working third wasn't taxing enough. I have been working full-time hours as a part-time employee since my second month at Lowes. At the time, it was a win for me. The most amount of money I have ever seen for my time. I took it with open arms, but with Lowes having little to no interest in replacing the people we have lost, the last few strands of people left are burning out. With so many positions available I decided to apply full-time, not only taking the higher up and more demanding position, but also giving away the more flexible part-time position in hopes of getting the help we need as soon as possible. Today, after always clocking in early, and going above and beyond, I was denied that position. Still no help, loss of hope. Which brings me back to my main point, under a billion dollar corporation, you're replaceable. Your feelings and opinions do not matter. Whether you show up and show out, or show up and do hardly anything, we all get the same result. Our store is completely falling apart, and we're stuck waiting on some guy, somewhere in an office chair. Word to the wise, if you're a hard working and talented person with true skillsets, take your skills elsewhere, don't waste away here.

","It all depends on who your boss is: Favoritism is a widespread problem in this particular store. Employees are not all treated the same and this is reflected in how much or how little your direct supervisor invests in you. Some managers shouldn’t be in their positions. Concerns fall on deaf ears. You will be blamed for things which are beyond your control. Infighting among some upper management filters down to sales floor level employees. Different managers in the store seem to have different levels of influence and this will directly affect your chances of success. In this store you will learn quickly whether or not you are valued. Good luck to you if you’re not.

","In management you are automatically setup to fail. The expectations passed down from management within Lowes are right at perfection. So at least they are looking for as close to as possible. I understand this, however seasonally due to many circumstances there may be as little as 10% of the tools required to meet the directives. Lowes management does not manage this at all. It's a hands off, dictated down ranks, just get the impossible job done without the tools and all else are excuses. This is the reason that my one star is there even though there are some positives. Any company that makes it an SOP to knowingly set the staffing up for failure should only get one star. Beware of the promise of advancement. They really talk this up. However, from entry level there is specialist, from specialist, supervisor, from supervisor there is a black hole. The black hole is assistant store manager. This position is purposely underpaid and scheduled to be purposely overworked. This is the first salary level and that is the key indicator. They have created a buffer between the job at hand and the store manager and they no doubt take full advantage of those that fall for it.
Advice to Management
When you do a walk through you schedule it and the store tries to do the best to make it look better than it does day to day. I get that. However, if you want to know how the store is doing have an open mind and get out there. Visit the stores, however let them know that it will no be announced and you are not going to fire them for standards not being met. You will just want to know why. There are so many reasons Lowes falls short of thier standards, and guess what, it is all trickled down from the ones dictating them. If you ask for perfection at least make sure you have staffing AT ALL TIMES to deliver it. No excuses. See how that no excuses thing that you trickled down just came back to bite you? Funny how that works.

Advice to Management
Listen to your associates, we understand you're trying to put out fires all over the store but there's an overwhelmingly obvious atmosphere of apathy in management toward employees. In the year I have worked for this company it has become overwhelmingly apparent that we are simply numbers and can be easily replaced and we are treated as such (spare a few managers).

","Applying for those positions of growth is a mute point, as they'll rarely move anyone. They'd rather hire from outside. Wages always seem low just like most working poor... they hire and schedule only part time and keep wages low. No FMLA for part time. Don't have a chronic ailment as a Lowes employee... eventually you could lose your job.
